3898,ABCB1 protects bat cells from DNA damage induced by genotoxic compounds,2019-06-27,"Bats are unusual mammals, with the ability to fly, and long lifespans. In addition, bats have a low incidence of cancer, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain elusive. Here we discovered that bat cells are more resistant than human and mouse cells to DNA damage induced by genotoxic drugs. We found that bat cells accumulate less chemical than human and mouse cells, and efficient drug efflux mediated by the ABC transporter ABCB1 underlies this improved response to genotoxic reagents. Inhibition of ABCB1 triggers an accumulation of doxorubicin, DNA damage, and cell death. ABCB1 is expressed at higher levels in several cell lines and tissues derived from bats compared to humans. Furthermore, increased drug efflux and high expression of ABCB1 are conserved across multiple bat species. Our findings suggest that enhanced efflux protects bat cells from DNA damage induced by genotoxic compounds, which may contribute to their low cancer incidence.","Koh, Javier; Itahana, Yoko; Mendenhall, Ian H.; Low, Dolyce; Soh, Eunice Xin Yi; Guo, Alvin Kunyao; Chionh, Yok Teng; Wang, Lin-Fa; Itahana, Koji",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6597548/,447

4777,SARS—ein Lehrstück der Infektionsepidemiologie und ein Meisterstück moderner Infektionskontrolle,2003-09-05,"This paper summarizes the features and performances of optical detection systems currently applied in order to monitor separations on microchip devices. Fluorescence detection, which delivers very high sensitivity and selectivity, is still the most widely applied method of detection. Instruments utilizing laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and lamp-based fluorescence along with recent applications of light-emitting diodes (LED) as excitation sources are also covered in this paper. Since chemiluminescence detection can be achieved using extremely simple devices which no longer require light sources and optical components for focusing and collimation, interesting approaches based on this technique are presented, too. Although UV/vis absorbance is a detection method that is commonly used in standard desktop electrophoresis and liquid chromatography instruments, it has not yet reached the same level of popularity for microchip applications. Current applications of UV/vis absorbance detection to microchip separations and innovative approaches that increase sensitivity are described. This article, which contains 85 references, focuses on developments and applications published within the last three years, points out exciting new approaches, and provides future perspectives on this field.","Götz, Sebastian; Karst, Uwe",Anal Bioanal Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7080113/,447

4785,Ein Fall aus der Höhenmedizin,2020-02-12,"Heterogeneities in behaviours of individuals may underpin important processes in evolutionary biology and ecology, including the spread of disease. Modelling approaches can sometimes fail to predict disease spread, which may partly be due to the number of unknown sources of variation in host behaviour. The European badger is a wildlife reservoir for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Britain and Ireland, and individual behaviour has been demonstrated to be an important factor in the spread of bTB among badgers and to cattle. Radio-telemetry devices were deployed on 40 badgers from eight groups to investigate patterns of den (sett) use in a high-density population, where each group had one or two main and three to eight outlier setts in their territory. Badgers were located at their setts for 28 days per season for 1 year to investigate how patterns differed between individuals. Denning behaviour may have a strong influence on contact patterns and the transmission of disease. We found significant heterogeneity, influenced by season, sex and age. Also, when controlling for these, bTB infection status interacting with season was highly correlated with sett use. Test-positive badgers spent more time away from their main sett than those that tested negative. We speculate that wider-ranging behaviour of test-positive animals may result in them contacting sources of infection more frequently and/or that their behaviour may be influenced by their disease status. Measures to control infectious diseases might be improved by targeting functional groups, specific areas or times of year that may contribute disproportionately to disease spread.

This study has used group interviews to explore how different temporal aspects of CM can be considered in CM design and how they can influence crisis managers SA. A prototype and a scenario were used as mediating materials. The result consists of two parts. The first part is comprised of the participants’ reflections on how timelines can be used to display information in CM information systems. According to the participants, timelines should present: deadlines, information sent to the public, incoming and outgoing information, an overview of where the current activities belong in the CM process and what has been going on since the last shift during shift changes. Timelines should not only display the listed information, but also provide functionality for adjusting the timescale so that information can be presented in alternative temporal perspectives. The second part of the result contains several obstacles that might influence the crisis managers’ ability to obtain SA. Obstacles elicited from the group discussions are: information overflow, fast changes of SA due to incoming information, difficulties to share SA with actors outside the CM centre, forgetting things that need attention and that SA depends on the quality of incoming information. The two parts of the result have been compiled into six design principles for how temporality can be considered in CM systems in order to support SA.","Gryszkiewicz, Anna; Chen, Fang",Cogn Technol Work,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087780/,447

When thickening of the interlobular septa or honeycombing are visible as predominant features, these patterns have a limited differential diagnosis. In this context, a detailed analysis of morphologic characteristics (e.g., smooth or nodular interlobular septal thickening) and of the pattern localisation (e.g., peripheral, basal and subpleural honeycombing) is required. Thickened intralobular septa, parenchymal bands, subpleural lines and the “interface sign” are all rather non-specific findings.

6009,Krebspatienten in der operativen Intensivmedizin,2018-01-24,"INTRODUCTION: Expansion of the donor pool by the use of grafts with extended donor criteria reduces waiting list mortality with an increased risk for graft and patient survival after liver transplantation. The ability of the number of fulfilled extended donor criteria as currently defined by the German Medical Association (BÄK-Score) to predict early outcome is unclear. PATIENTS: A total of 291 consecutive adult liver transplantations (01.01.2007–31.12.2010) in 257 adult recipients were analyzed. METHODS: Primary study endpoints were 30 day mortality, 3 month mortality, 3 month patient and graft survival and the necessity of acute retransplantation within 30 days. For primary study endpoints a ROC curve analysis was performed to calculate sensitivity, specificity and overall model correctness of the BÄK score as a predictive model. Further methods included Kaplan-Meier estimates, log-rank tests, Cox regression analysis, logistic regression analysis and χ(2)-tests. RESULTS: The number of extended donor criteria fulfilled had no statistically significant influence on the primary study endpoints (p > 0.05) or on patient survival (p > 0.05). ROC curve analysis revealed areas under the curve ≤ 0.561 for the prediction of primary study endpoints (overall model correctness < 58%, sensitivity < 52%). CONCLUSIONS: The number of fulfilled extended donor criteria as currently defined by the German Medical Association is unable to predict early outcome after liver transplantation.","Schrem, H.; Reichert, B.; Frühauf, N.; Kleine, M.; Zachau, L.; Becker, T.; Lehner, F.; Bektas, H.; Klempnauer, J.",Chirurg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095839/,447
6012,Erweiterte Spenderkriterien der Bundesärztekammer: Untersuchung zu ihrer Anwendbarkeit als prognostisches Modell für den frühen Verlauf nach Lebertransplantation,2012-07-20,"Anemia is a frequent finding, particularly in the elderly population, and usually indicative of a serious disease. The main causes of preoperative anemia are acute or chronic hemorrhage, iron deficiency, renal insufficiency, inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. A preexisting mild anemia may be enhanced or unmasked by surgically induced bleeding or repeated diagnostic phlebotomies, and by a postoperative erythropoietic dysfunction caused by the surgical trauma, irrespective of any hemorrhage. Low hemoglobin values are associated with a distinct increase of mortality and morbidity, both in the normal population and perioperatively and in the critically ill patients. The anemia-associated risk is exacerbated by preexisting cardiovascular disease, important intraoperative blood loss and advanced age. In contradiction to established therapeutical concepts, the administration of allogeneic blood beyond hemoglobin levels of 8–10 g/dl has not been found to decrease perioperative or intensive care morbidity or mortality. Rather, in addition to the inherent long-term risks of transfusions, a liberal transfusion strategy seems to increase the incidence of postoperative complications. Thus, current transfusion guidelines tend to be interpreted in an increasingly restrictive manner. Depending on the urgency of the clinical situation, the primary goal should be to diagnose and treat the underlying disease, rather than to focus on the symptom anemia. Time permitting, the patient's cardiovascular and pulmonary status should be optimized preoperatively. Furthermore, iron should be substituted to treat and prevent deficiency. Recombinant human erythropoietin has successfully been used to treat anemia of chronic renal failure and chronic disease, as well as in the perioperative and intensive care setting, and to support the efficiency of autologous programs.","Kulier, A.; Gombotz, H.",Anaesthesist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7095844/,447

Poor socioeconomic status and inadequate financing of health systems result in a high burden of disease, a high rate of self-financing of healthcare costs by the patients, as well as insufficient personnel, infrastructural and material equipment of most healthcare facilities. Important limiting factors for anesthesia are low educational standards and a widespread lack of oxygen and medical gas supplies, as well as locally serviceable medical equipment.

April 2008 in Hannover: Abstracts mit Autorenindex",2008-03-16,"In order to better understand the bovine breathing pattern, tidal breathing flow-volume loops (TBFVL) were analyzed in 24 healthy cattle of different body weights (range: 37–660 kg) (Group A) and in 28 cattle suffering from the common respiratory diseases: verminous bronchitis (Group B); shipping fever (Group C); acute respiratory distress syndrome (Group D); respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia (Group E); organophosphate poisoning (Group F); and necrotic laryngitis (Group G). Respiratory airflow and tidal volume were measured with a breathing mask-Fleisch pneumotachograph assembly. TBFVL were traced from these values using a computerized method. All the loop indices proposed by Amis and Kurpershoek (1986a) were calculated from 5 representative breathing cycles for each of the 52 animals. The TBFVL shapes and indices were relatively constant in most healthy cattle and were not correlated with the body size. When compared to normal values, animals with moderate respiratory syndromes (Groups B and C) had a more flattened shape to their TBFVL. On the other hand, in most cattle with severe respiratory pathologies (Groups D, F and G) expiration tended to be biphasic with the peak expiratory flow (PEF) occurring significantly later than in healthy animals. Both PEF and peak inspiratory flow were increased in all the pathological conditions. The TBFVL indices were more frequently and more severely changed during expiration than during inspiration.","Lekeux, P.; Art, T.; Amory, H.",Vet Res Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101749/,447
6580,Die Diagnose der Sepsis,2006,"Infants (<1 year old) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are particularly vulnerable to intensive cytotoxic therapy. Indeed, the mortality rate was high among infants enrolled in the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group AML-05 study, which prompted us to temporarily suspend patient enrollment and amend the protocol. Forty-five infants with AML were enrolled. For patients aged <2 years, drug doses were adjusted for body weight. Following the protocol amendments, doses for infants were reduced by a further 33 % in the initial induction course. Six infants died during the induction phase (including five early deaths), mainly due to pulmonary complications. The 3-year probability of overall survival (pOS) in all 45 infants [55.9 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 37.9–70.6 %] was significantly lower than that of patients aged 1 to <2 years (77.0 %, 95 % CI 62.7–86.3 %) and those aged ≥2 years (74.7 %, 95 % CI 69.2–79.4 %) (P = 0.037), mainly due to the higher non-relapse mortality rate in infants. No early deaths occurred after the protocol amendments, and the 3-year pOS of the 17 infants enrolled thereafter was 76.4 % (95 % CI 48.8–90.4 %).

METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of a referral children's hospital in South India with DHF over 1.5 years (2001–January 2003). RESULTS: Of 858 patients with dengue fever/DHF admitted to the hospital during the study period, 109 cases with severe forms of disease required PICU admission, of which 9 patients died. 77 were under 5 years of age. The commonest indication for PICU admission was persistent shock (39 patients) followed by requirement for positive pressure ventilation in 29 patients (10 of whom had Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome [ARDS]) and neurological symptoms in 24 patients. An important finding was the presence of diastolic dysfunction in 3 children. Six deaths of refractory shock included 4 who had ARDS and DIC and 2 who had shock with DIC 3 patients had abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) has not been previously described in children with DSS and may lead to fluid refractory shock if not corrected. All patients had thrombocytopenia which was a defining feature of the syndrome, while 74 were also coagulopathic and 6 had severe fatal DIC. Hepatic dysfunction was more severe in children with prolonged shock, however, only a fifth of cases (5/24) with neurological manifestations were in shock. Other significant reasons for neurological presentation included cerebral edema, and encephalopathy secondary to hepatic dysfunction. 2 children had features of Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), previously only described in adults with dengue. CONCLUSION: It was found that complications such as DIC, diastolic dysfunction, abdominal compartment syndrome, ARDS and hepatic dysfunction were more frequent in severe established shock. However, most neurological events were unrelated to the perfusion status. Children referred late were harder to resuscitate. There were 9 PICU deaths (case fatality rate of 8.35%). Severe refractory shock, DIC, ARDS, hepatic failure and neurological manifestations singly or in combination were the commonest causes of death in the present study.","Kamath, Shrishu R.; Ranjit, Suchitra",Indian J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101810/,447
6650,Der Leukämiepatient auf der Intensivstation,2007-05-31,"Severe, organ-threatening and life-threatening manifestations of inflammatory rheumatic diseases, such as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in the context of small vessel vasculitis, sometimes inadequately respond to immunosuppressive treatment. In the case of an immanent or already occurring organ failure, immunosuppressive treatment may need to be supplemented with rapidly effective rescue treatment procedures. Due to the rarity of many rheumatic diseases, the evidence for the use of rescue treatment, such as plasmapheresis, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and the administration of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), is relatively low for many indications. The use of plasmapheresis is considered useful in acute anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease (Goodpasture’s syndrome) or catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). The use of ECMO treatment may be considered for persistent respiratory failure despite mechanical ventilation due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Administration of IVIG is indicated for acute cardiac involvement in Kawasaki’s disease and may be considered in catastrophic APS and refractory myositis.","Hellmich, B.; Löffler, C.",Z Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101899/,447

We used Pj real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) with the objective to discriminate PCP from Pj colonization in immunocompromised patients. All positive Pj qPCR [targeting the major surface glycoprotein (MSG) gene] obtained in respiratory samples from immunocompromised patients presenting pneumonia at the Grenoble University Hospital, France, were collected between August 2009 and April 2011. Diagnoses were retrospectively determined by a multidisciplinary group of experts blinded to the Pj qPCR results. Thirty-one bronchoalveolar lavages and four broncho aspirations positive for the Pj qPCR were obtained from 35 immunocompromised patients. Diagnoses of definite, probable, and possible PCP, and pneumonia from another etiology were retrospectively made for 7, 4, 5, and 19 patients, respectively. Copy numbers were significantly higher in the “definite group” (median 465,000 copies/ml) than in the “probable group” (median 38,600 copies/ml), the “possible group” (median 1,032 copies/ml), and the “other diagnosis group” (median 390 copies/ml). With the value of 3,160 copies/ml, the sensitivity and specificity of qPCR for the diagnosis of PCP were 100 % and 70 %, respectively. With the value of 31,600 copies/ml, the sensitivity and specificity were 80 % and 100 %, respectively. The positive predictive value was 100 % for results with more than 31,600 copies/ml and the negative predictive value was 100 % for results with fewer than 3,160 copies/ml. qPCR targeting the MSG gene can be helpful to discriminate PCP from Pj colonization in immunocompromised patients, using two cut-off values, with a gray zone between them.","Maillet, M.; Maubon, D.; Brion, J.

METHODS: We assessed the sublingual microcirculation in seven consecutive patients with acute lung injury related to influenza A (H1N1) infection. The evaluation was carried out using sidestream dark field (SDF) imaging within the first 96 hr after the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit. Thenar oxygen saturation (StO(2)) was also measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during a vascular occlusion test. In addition, the Lung Injury Score (LIS) and the APACHE II and SOFA scores were recorded. RESULTS: All patients received invasive mechanical ventilation and at least one of the following adjuvant therapies: inhaled nitric oxide (n = 4), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n = 1), prone position (n = 4), recruitment maneuver (n = 3), and hydrocortisone 50 mg·hr(−6) (n = 6). The median time from admission to microcirculatory assessment was 21 hr. Three patients had bacterial superinfection. The median LIS and PaO(2)/F(i)O(2) were 2.5 (2.25-3.25) and 178 (158-212), respectively. Three subjects were treated with norepinephrine. During a vascular occlusion test, the microcirculation was moderately to severely compromised with a NIRS ascending slope of 2.39%·sec(−1) (1.75-2.67%·sec(−1)), 66% (60-86%) of perfused small vessels in the sublingual microcirculation, and a microvascular flow index of 1.9 (1.3-2.6). The degree of microcirculatory abnormalities detected by the NIRS and SDF imaging techniques was correlated with the severity of the disease, as reflected by the SOFA and APACHE II scores.

6790,Aktueller Stand der Lungentransplantation: Pulmonale und nichtpulmonale Komplikationen,2013-05-31,"Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) is a distinct neoplasm within the spectrum of Hodgkin lymphomas with characteristic clinical, morphological, and immunohistochemical features. According to the WHO definition, lymph nodes involved by NLPHL should have a nodular or nodular and diffuse proliferation of scattered large neoplastic lymphocyte-predominant (LP) cells in a small cell background that reside in expanded follicular dendritic cell meshworks; the LP cells must also have a distinct immunophenotypic profile. The LP cells are monoclonal B cells that are typically CD20, BCL6, CD79a, and CD45 positive and are CD30 and CD15 negative. In contrast, the Reed-Sternberg cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) are typically positive for CD15 and CD30. However, in CHL, CD20 staining is variable, and CD15 staining may be absent in some cases. Thus, CD30 is often considered to be the most distinctive marker between CHL and NLPHL. In order to better assess CD30 staining in NLPHL, we reviewed 220 cases of NLPHL and found 21 cases that showed at least focal staining of the neoplastic cells for CD30. The CD30 staining was often faint, but occasionally strong, and typically was found only on a subset of the LP cells. We evaluated the clinicopathologic features of these cases to determine whether they showed differences from typical CD30-negative NLPHL and found no significant difference with respect to clinical presentation, histology, other immunophenotypic features or outcome. In summary, we conclude that CD30 expression by LP cells in NLPHL can be seen and should not lead to a misdiagnosis of CHL. The presence of CD30-positive LP cells is not associated with other features of CHL or unusually aggressive behavior.","Seliem, Rania M.; Ferry, Judith A.; Hasserjian, Robert P.; Harris, Nancy L.; Zukerberg, Lawrence R.",J Hematop,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102138/,447

METHODS: All children (0–12 y of age) diagnosed and confirmed as dengue fever at a tertiary care hospital at Puducherry, between the 1st of August 2012 and January 31st 2015 were reviewed retrospectively from hospital case records as per the revised World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines 2011 for dengue fever. The diagnosis was confirmed by NS1 antigen-based ELISA test or dengue serology for IgM and IgG antibodies and the data was analyzed using SPSS 16.0 statistical software. RESULTS: Out of 254 children admitted with dengue fever, non-severe dengue and severe dengue were seen in 62.6 % and 37.4 % respectively. Atypical manifestations were seen in 106 cases (41.7 %). Mean age of presentation was 6.9(3.3) y. M: F ratio was 1.2:1. The common manifestations of severe dengue infection were shock (37.4 %), bleeding (20.1 %) and multi-organ dysfunction (2.4 %). The most common atypical manifestations of dengue fever were lymphadenopathy (41.7 %), splenomegaly (21.2 %), biphasic fever (18.1 %), hepatitis (11.4 %), febrile diarrhea (6.3 %), refractory shock (2.4 %) and impaired consciousness (1.9 %). The other atypical manifestations present were portal hypertension, acalculous cholecystitis, appendicitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), myocarditis, pericardial effusion, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT), myositis, acute kidney injury (AKI), hemophagocytic syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Platelet count did not always correlate well with the severity of bleeding. There were six deaths (2.4 %) and out of them four presented with impaired consciousness (66.6 %). The common causes for poor outcome were multiorgan failure, encephalopathy and refractory shock. CONCLUSIONS: The atypical manifestations of dengue fever are no more a rare entity. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion and vigilance for atypical manifestations of dengue fever as lack of timely detection and management could be fatal. Impaired consciousness was the most ominous atypical manifestation of severe dengue infection.","Pothapregada, Sriram; Kamalakannan, Banupriya; Thulasingam, Mahalakshmy",Indian J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102293/,447

8903,Rechtliche Grundlagen der Berufsausübungsgemeinschaft,2020-04-06,"This paper reviews the changing health situation in China, which has shown remarkable improvement in the 50 years since the founding of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949. At first sight this improving health situation follows the classical epidemiological transition model. Just three decades ago health in China was characterised by high rates of infectious disease and early mortality (diseases of poverty) in a mainly peasant society. More recently infectious disease rates have decreased, with corresponding and extended morbidity and mortality associated with an aging population in a rapidly urbanising society. This process has given rise to new health problems, including chronic and degenerative diseases (diseases of affluence). Nonetheless, while there is some validity in the application of the epidemiological transition concept, further analysis demonstrates that China faces a new epidemiological phase, characterised by increasing life expectancy and diseases of affluence coupled with the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases. We demonstrate that China’s state policy plays a major role in defining the parameters of health in a Chinese context. We conclude that, today, China is faced with a new set of health issues, including the impact of smoking, hypertension, the health effects of environmental pollution and the rise of HIV/AIDS; however, state policy remains vital to the health of China’s vast population. The challenge for policy is to maintain health reform whilst tackling the problems associated with rapid urbanisation, widening social and spatial inequalities and the emergence of HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases.","Cook, Ian G.; Dummer, Trevor J.B.",Health Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7133822/,447

Here, we show that intravenously injected carbon quantum dots, functionalized with multiple paired α-carboxyl and amino groups that bind to the large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (which is expressed in most tumours), selectively accumulate in human tumour xenografts in mice and in an orthotopic mouse model of human glioma. The functionalized quantum dots, which structurally mimic large amino acids and can be loaded with aromatic drugs through π–π stacking interactions, enabled—in the absence of detectable toxicity—near-infrared fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging of the tumours and a reduction in tumour burden after the targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics to the tumours. The versatility of functionalization and high tumour selectivity of the quantum dots make them broadly suitable for tumour-specific imaging and drug delivery.","Li, Shuhua; Su, Wen; Wu, Hao; Yuan, Ting; Yuan, Chang; Liu, Jun; Deng, Gang; Gao, Xingchun; Chen, Zeming; Bao, Youmei; Yuan, Fanglong; Zhou, Shixin; Tan, Hongwei; Li, Yunchao; Li, Xiaohong; Fan, Louzhen; Zhu, Jia; Chen, Ann T.; Liu, Fuyao; Zhou, Yu; Li, Miao; Zhai, Xingchen; Zhou, Jiangbing",Nat Biomed Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197249/,447

METHODS: Three groups of dogs were used, 29 with any stifle dysfunction (STIF), 17 with other musculoskeletal disease except stifle (OTHER) and 11 controls (CTRL). All dogs were tested with the FCSI by the same physiotherapist at three occasions, at baseline, at six weeks and 10 weeks, and once also by another physiotherapist. RESULTS: Dogs in the STIF group demonstrated significantly higher (P<0.001) FCSI scores than in OTHER or CTRL groups at baseline. Only the STIF group showed a significant (P<0.001) change in FCSI score at all time points, indicating responsiveness to change. There were no significant differences between the evaluators (P=0.736), showing good intertester reliability, supported by moderate to good (0.78) intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The evaluator performing the FCSI did not have a significant effect when comparing the groups of dogs (P=0.214). The 95 per cent confidence intervals of the ICC per group were 0.79 (0.60, 0.91) for STIF, 0.83 (0.53, 0.96) for OTHER 0.78 (0.64, 0.88) for all dogs.

12649,Herausforderungen der Digitalisierung in der Traumaversorgung,2020-08-27,"BACKGROUND: The Plasmodium falciparum sexual-stage surface proteins Pfs25 and Pfs230 are antigen candidates for a malaria transmission-blocking vaccine (TBV), and have been widely investigated as such. It is not clear whether simultaneously presenting these two antigens in a particulate vaccine would enhance the transmission reducing activity (TRA) of induced antibodies. To assess this, immunization was carried out with liposomes containing synthetic lipid adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), and cobalt-porphyrin-phospholipid (CoPoP), which rapidly converts recombinant, his-tagged antigens into particles. METHODS: His-tagged, recombinant Pfs25 and Pfs230C1 were mixed with CoPoP liposomes to form a bivalent vaccine. Antigens were fluorescently labelled to infer duplex particleization serum-stability and binding kinetics using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Mice and rabbits were immunized with individual or duplexed particleized Pfs25 and Pfs230C1, at fixed total antigen doses. The resulting antibody responses were assessed for magnitude and TRA. RESULTS: Pfs230C1 and Pfs25 rapidly bound CoPoP liposomes to form a serum-stable, bivalent particle vaccine. In mice, immunization with 5 ng of total antigen (individual antigen or duplexed) elicited functional antibodies against Pfs25 and Pfs230. Compared to immunization with the individual antigen, Pfs25 antibody production was moderately lower for the bivalent CoPoP vaccine, whereas Pfs230C1 antibody production was not impacted. All antibodies demonstrated at least 92% inhibition in oocyst density at 750 μg/mL purified mouse IgG in the standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA). At lower IgG concentrations, the bivalent vaccine did not improve TRA; antibodies induced by particleized Pfs25 alone showed stronger function in these conditions. In rabbits, immunization with a 20 µg total antigen dose with the duplexed antigens yielded similar antibody production against Pfs25 and Pfs230 compared to immunization with a 20 µg dose of individual antigens. However, no enhanced TRA was observed with duplexing. CONCLUSIONS: Pfs25, Pfs230 or the duplexed combination can readily be prepared as particulate vaccines by mixing CoPoP liposomes with soluble, recombinant antigens. This approach induces potent transmission-reducing antibodies following immunization in mice and rabbits. Immunization with bivalent, particleized, Pfs230 and Pfs25 did not yield antibodies with superior TRA compared to immunization with particleized Pfs25 as a single antigen. Altogether, duplexing antigens is straightforward and effective using CoPoP liposomes, but is likely to be more useful for targeting distinct parasite life stages.","Huang, Wei-Chiao; Deng, Bingbing; Mabrouk, Moustafa T.; Seffouh, Amal; Ortega, Joaquin; Long, Carole; Miura, Kazutoyo; Wu, Yimin; Lovell, Jonathan F.",Malar J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7453371/,447

PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched by using free text words and medical subject headings terms related with “male hypogonadism”, “late-onset hypogonadism”, elderly, cognition, “mild cognitive impairment”, memory, “testosterone replacement therapy” used in various combinations according to the specific clinical questions. Original articles, reviews, and randomized controlled trials written in English were selected. Results. A long-term TRT could improve specific cognitive functions, such as verbal and spatial memory, cognitive flexibility, and physical vitality. However, randomized controlled trials do not provide positive results, and in most of the cases TRT might not induce beneficial effects on cognitive function in elderly men. Discussion and conclusions. Since the lengthening of life expectancy, the prevalence rate of cognitive decline in elderly men is expected to increase remarkably over the next decade with considerable healthcare and economical concerns. Therefore, this remains a relevant clinical topic and further investigations are needed for clarifying the role of TRT especially in elderly men with hypogonadism.","Lisco, Giuseppe; Giagulli, Vito Angelo; De Tullio, Anna; De Pergola, Giovanni; Guastamacchia, Edoardo; Triggiani, Vincenzo",Geriatrics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7709679/,447

The aim of this study was to test whether outcome prediction improves when patients are reclassified based on predefined PaO(2)/FiO(2) and PEEP cutoffs 24 h after development of mild hypoxemia while not having ARDS. METHODS: Post hoc analysis of a large prospective, multicenter, observational study that ran in the ICUs of two academic hospitals in the Netherlands between January 2011 and December 2013. Patients were classified into four groups using predefined cutoffs for PaO(2)/FiO(2) (250 mmHg) and PEEP (5 cm H(2)O), both at onset of hypoxemia and after 24 h: PaO(2)/FiO(2) ≥ 250 mmHg and PEEP < 6 cm H(2)O (group I), PaO(2)/FiO(2) ≥ 250 mmHg and PEEP ≥ 6 cm H(2)O (group II), PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 250 mmHg and PEEP < 6 cm H(2)O (group III), and PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 250 mmHg and PEEP ≥ 6 cm H(2)O (group IV), to look for trend association with all-cause in-hospital mortality, the primary outcome. Secondary outcome were ICU- and 90-day mortality, and the number of ventilator-free days or ICU-free days and alive at day 28. RESULTS: The analysis included 689 consecutive patients. All-cause in-hospital mortality was 35%. There was minimal variation in mortality between the four groups at onset of hypoxemia (33, 36, 38, and 34% in groups I to IV, respectively; P = 0.65). Reclassification after 24 h resulted in a strong trend with increasing mortality from group I to group IV (31, 31, 37, and 48% in groups I to IV, respectively; P < 0.01). Similar trends were found for the secondary endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: Reclassification using PaO(2)/FiO(2) and PEEP cutoffs after 24 h improved classification for outcome in invasively ventilated ICU patients with hypoxemia not explained by ARDS, compared to classification at onset of hypoxemia.

Although insufficient PA is prevalent in nearly every demographic, people with socio-economic disadvantage participate in lower levels of PA than those who are more affluent, and this contributes to widening health inequities. PA promotion interventions in primary healthcare are effective and cost effective, however they are not widely implemented in practice. Further, current approaches that adopt a ‘universal’ approach to PA promotion do not consider or address the additional barriers experienced by people who experience socioeconomic disadvantages. To address the research to policy and practice gap, and taking Australia as a case study, this commentary proposes a novel model which blends an implementation science framework with the principles of proportionate universalism. Proportionate universalism is a principle suggesting that health interventions and policies need to be universal, not targeted, but with intensity and scale proportionate to the level of social need and/or disadvantage. Within this model, we propose interrelated and multi-level evidence-based policies and strategies to support PA promotion in primary healthcare while addressing health inequities. The principles outlined in the new model which blends proportionate (Pro) universalism principles and Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM), ‘ProPRISM’ can be applied to the implementation of PA promotion interventions in health care settings in other high-income countries. Future studies should test the model and provide evidence of its effectiveness in improving implementation and patient health outcomes and cost-effectiveness. There is potential to expand the proposed model to other health sectors (e.g., secondary and tertiary care) and to address other chronic disease risk factors such as unhealthy diet, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Therefore, this approach has the potential to transform the delivery of health care to a prevention-focused health service model, which could reduce the prevalence and burden of chronic disease and health care costs in high-income countries.","Klepac Pogrmilovic, Bojana; Linke, Sarah; Craike, Melinda",Health Res Policy Syst,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7813166/,447

We found that the expression of catalase, manganese-superoxide dismutase, Sirt1, and p53 was increased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after 14 days of moderate red wine consumption. This increase was accompanied by an enhanced metabolic wellness: fatty acids, cholesterol, branched chain amino acids (isoleucine and leucine), ketone bodies (acetoacetate), bacterial co-metabolites (trimethylamine), and cellular antioxidants (taurine) contributed to a change in metabolic profile after moderate red wine consumption by the nuns. No serious unwanted side effects were observed. Finally, we tested the effect of moderate red wine consumption on longevity in a controlled animal population, such as D. melanogaster, and found that it increased average life span by 7%. In conclusion, moderate red wine consumption increases the expression of key longevity-related genes and improves metabolic health in humans and increases longevity in flies.","Gambini, Juan; Gimeno-Mallench, Lucia; Olaso-Gonzalez, Gloria; Mastaloudis, Angela; Traber, Maret G.; Monleón, Daniel; Borrás, Consuelo; Viña, Jose",Antioxidants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7920262/,447

Based on the well-known MARTINI CG force field, the recently developed Gō-MARTINI model for proteins describes large-amplitude structural dynamics, which has not been possible with the commonly used elastic network model. Using the Gō-MARTINI model, we conduct MD simulations of the F-BAR Pacsin1 protein on lipid membrane. We observe that structural changes of the non-globular protein are largely dependent on the definition of the native contacts in the Gō model. To address this issue, we introduced a simple cutoff scheme and tuned the cutoff distance of the native contacts and the interaction strength of the Lennard-Jones potentials in the Gō-MARTINI model. With the optimized Gō-MARTINI model, we show that it reproduces structural fluctuations of the Pacsin1 dimer from atomistic simulations. We also show that two Pacsin1 dimers properly assemble through lateral interaction on the lipid membrane.

In this study, we computed NE scores for patient-derived SCLC cell lines and xenografts, as well as human tumors. We aligned NE properties with transcription factor-defined molecular subtypes. Then we investigated the different immune phenotypes associated with high and low NE scores. We found repression of immune response genes as a shared feature between classic SCLC and pulmonary neuroendocrine cells of the healthy lung. With loss of NE fate, variant SCLC tumors regain cell-autonomous immune gene expression and exhibit higher tumor-immune interactions. Pan-cancer analysis revealed this NE lineage-specific immune phenotype in other cancers. Additionally, we observed MHC I re-expression in SCLC upon development of chemoresistance. These findings may help guide the design of treatment regimens in SCLC.","Cai, Ling; Liu, Hongyu; Huang, Fang; Fujimoto, Junya; Girard, Luc; Chen, Jun; Li, Yongwen; Zhang, Yu-An; Deb, Dhruba; Stastny, Victor; Pozo, Karine; Kuo, Christin S.; Jia, Gaoxiang; Yang, Chendong; Zou, Wei; Alomar, Adeeb; Huffman, Kenneth; Papari-Zareei, Mahboubeh; Yang, Lin; Drapkin, Benjamin; Akbay, Esra A.; Shames, David S.; Wistuba, Ignacio I.; Wang, Tao; Johnson, Jane E.; Xiao, Guanghua; DeBerardinis, Ralph J.; Minna, John D.; Xie, Yang; Gazdar, Adi F.",Commun Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7943563/,447

16708,Herzstillstand: Drei Mythen zur Reanimation,2021-04-20,"INTRODUCTION: The clinical efficacy and safety of ceftolozane/tazobactam for the treatment of ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (vHABP) and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) has been demonstrated in the phase III randomised controlled trial ASPECT-NP. However, there are no published data on the cost-effectiveness of ceftolozane/tazobactam for vHABP/VABP. These nosocomial infections are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, and are increasingly complicated by growing rates of resistance and the inappropriate use of antimicrobials. This study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of ceftolozane/tazobactam compared with meropenem for the treatment of vHABP/VABP in a US hospital setting. METHODS: A short-term decision tree followed by a long-term Markov model was developed to estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years associated with ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem in the treatment of patients with vHABP/VABP. Pathogen susceptibility and clinical efficacy were informed by the Program to Assess Ceftolozane/Tazobactam Susceptibility (PACTS) database and ASPECT-NP, respectively. A US healthcare sector perspective was adopted, capturing direct costs borne by third-party payers or integrated health systems, and direct health effects for patients. RESULTS: In the confirmed treatment setting (post-susceptibility results), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ceftolozane/tazobactam compared to meropenem was US$12,126 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY); this reduced when used in the early treatment setting (before susceptibility results) at $4775/QALY. CONCLUSION: Ceftolozane/tazobactam represents a highly cost-effective treatment option for patients with vHABP/VABP versus meropenem when used in either the confirmed or early treatment setting; with increased cost-effectiveness shown in the early setting.

16709,Dschingis Khan: Schwarzer Tod eines Kriegers,2021-04-20,"BACKGROUND: The burden of HIV, HBV, and HCV infections remains disproportionately high in sub-Saharan Africa, with high rates of co-infections. Multiplex rapid diagnostic tests for HIV, HBV and HCV serological testing with high analytical performances may improve the “cascade of screening” and quite possibly the linkage-to-care with reduced cost. Based on our previous field experience of HIV self-testing, we herein aimed at evaluating the practicability and acceptability of a prototype finger-stick whole-blood Triplex HIV/HCV/HBsAg self-test as a simultaneous serological screening tool for HIV, HBV, and HCV in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). METHODS: A cross-sectional multicentric study consisting of face-to-face, paper-based, and semi-structured questionnaires with a home-based and facility-based recruitment of untrained adult volunteers at risk of HIV, HBV, and HCV infections recruited from the general public was conducted in 2020 in urban and rural areas in the DRC. The practicability of the Triplex self-test was assessed by 3 substudies on the observation of self-test manipulation including the understanding of the instructions for use (IFU), on the interpretation of Triplex self-test results and on its acceptability. RESULTS: A total of 251 volunteers (mean age, 28 years; range, 18–49; 154 males) were included, from urban [160 (63.7%)] and rural [91 (36.3%)] areas. Overall, 242 (96.4%) participants performed the Triplex self-test and succeeded in obtaining a valid test result with an overall usability index of 89.2%. The correct use of the Triplex self-test was higher in urban areas than rural areas (51.2% versus 16.5%; aOR: 6.9). The use of video IFU in addition to paper-based IFU increased the correct manipulation and interpretation of the Triplex self-test. A total of 197 (78.5%) participants correctly interpreted the Triplex self-test results, whereas 54 (21.5%) misinterpreted their results, mainly the positive test results harboring low-intensity band (30/251; 12.0%), and preferentially the HBsAg band (12/44; 27.3%). The rates of acceptability of reuse, distribution of the Triplex self-test to third parties (partner, friend, or family member), linkage to the health care facility for confirmation of results and treatment, and confidence in the self-test results were very high, especially among participants from urban areas. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows evidence for the first time in sub-Saharan Africa on good practicability and high acceptability of a prototype Triplex HIV/HCV/HBsAg self-test for simultaneous diagnosis of three highly prevalent chronic viral infections, providing the rational basis of using self-test harboring four bands of interest, i.e. the control, HIV, HCV, and HBsAg bands. The relatively frequent misinterpretation of the Triplex self-test points however the necessity to improve the delivery of this prototype Triplex self-test probably in a supervised setting. Finally, these observations lay the foundations for the potential large-scale use of the Triplex self-test in populations living in sub-Saharan Africa at high risk for HIV, HBV, and HCV infections.","Tonen-Wolyec, Serge; Djang’eing’a, Roland Marini; Batina-Agasa, Salomon; Kayembe Tshilumba, Charles; Muwonga Masidi, Jérémie; Hayette, Marie-Pierre; Bélec, Laurent",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8034751/,447
16787,Spezielle intensivmedizinische Krankheitsbilder der schwangeren Patientin,2021-04-13,"Tripartite motif-containing 27 (TRIM27) belongs to the triple motif (TRIM) protein family, which plays a role in a variety of biological activities. Our previous study showed that the TRIM27 protein was highly expressed in the glomerular endothelial cells of patients suffering from lupus nephritis (LN). However, whether TRIM27 is involved in the injury of glomerular endothelial cells in lupus nephritis remains to be clarified. Here, we detected the expression of the TRIM27 protein in glomerular endothelial cells in vivo and in vitro. In addition, the influence of TRIM27 knockdown on endothelial cell damage in MRL/lpr mice and cultured human renal glomerular endothelial cells (HRGECs) was explored. The results revealed that the expression of TRIM27 in endothelial cells was significantly enhanced in vivo and in vitro. Downregulating the expression of TRIM27 inhibited the breakdown of the glycocalyx and the injury of endothelial cells via the FoxO1 pathway. Moreover, HRGECs transfected with the WT-FoxO1 plasmid showed a reduction in impairment caused by LN plasma. Furthermore, suppression of the protein kinase B (Akt) pathway could attenuate damage by mediating the expression of TRIM27. Thus, the present study showed that TRIM27 participated in the injury of glomerular endothelial cells and served as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of lupus nephritis.","Liu, Jinxi; Xu, Jie; Huang, Jie; Gu, Cunyang; Liu, Qingjuan; Zhang, Wei; Gao, Fan; Tian, Yuexin; Miao, Xinyan; Zhu, Zixuan; Jia, Baiyun; Tian, Yu; Wu, Lunbi; Zhao, Hang; Feng, Xiaojuan; Liu, Shuxia",Lab Invest,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8044289/,447
16792,Digitale Lehre im Fach Pathologie,2021-04-14,"BACKGROUND: Injuries, the cause of an estimated 4.5 million deaths annually and many more disabilities worldwide each year, are the predictable outcome of particular circumstances. One of the most effective ways to prevent injuries is through policy and legislation. The aim of this research study was to identify and critically review all policy and legislation in Nepal that had the potential to prevent injuries. METHODS: We identified legislation and policy that met inclusion criteria through a stakeholder meeting, networks and contacts, and websites and electronic resources. Each included document was critically reviewed to identify areas of strength and opportunities for improvement. We compared the included documents against WHO’s recommendations of known effective interventions. RESULTS: Sixty-two documents met the inclusion criteria for this review. Of these, 24 (38.7%) were exclusively related to road injuries, 11 (17.7%) to occupational injuries, 6 (9.7%) to injuries in the home and 5 (8.1%) to injuries at school; 30 (48.4%) documents included text related to the first response to injuries. Of 127 strategic recommendations by WHO that provided an area for policy or legislative focus, 21 (16.5%) were considered adequately met by Nepali policy and legislation, 43 (33.9%) were considered partially met and 63 (49.6%) were not met. CONCLUSION: We drew five conclusions from this critical policy review, which we have related to recommendations as follows: widening the scope of legislation and policy for injury prevention to emphasize injuries occurring at home or school; addressing the causes of injuries and promoting proven preventive measures; greater clarity on both individual and institutional roles and responsibilities; trustworthy data and quality evidence to inform decision-making; and financial investment and capacity-strengthening for injury prevention and first response. The current system of federal governance in Nepal has potential for strengthening injury prevention and first response at the central, provincial and local levels.

This study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of galcanezumab in the prevention of high-frequency episodic migraine (HFEM) and chronic migraine (CM) in a real-life setting. METHODS: This multicenter prospective observational cohort study was conducted between November 2019 and January 2021 at 13 Italian headache centers. Consecutive adult HFEM and CM patients clinically eligible were enrolled and treated with galcanezumab subcutaneous injection 120 mg monthly with the first loading dose of 240 mg. The primary endpoint was the change in monthly migraine days (MMDs) in HFEM and monthly headache days (MHDs) in CM patients after 6 months of therapy (V6). Secondary endpoints were the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), monthly painkiller intake (MPI), HIT-6 and MIDAS scores changes, ≥50% responder rates (RR), the conversion rate from CM to episodic migraine (EM) and Medication Overuse (MO) discontinuation. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-three patients (80.5% female, 47.1 ± 11.7 years, 79.8% CM) were included. At V6, MMDs reduced by 8 days in HFEM and MHDs by 13 days in CM patients (both p < .001). NRS, MPI, HIT-6 and MIDAS scores significantly decreased (p < .001). Ten patients (6.1%) dropped out for inefficacy and classified as non-responders. Patients with ≥50%RRs, i.e. responders, were 76.5% in the HFEM and 63.5% in the CM group at V6. Among CM patients, the V6 responders presented a lower body mass index (p = .018) and had failed a lower number of preventive treatments (p = .013) than non-responders. At V6, 77.2% of CM patients converted to EM, and 82.0% ceased MO. Adverse events, none serious, were reported in up to 10.3% of patients during evaluation times. CONCLUSIONS: Galcanezumab in real life was safe, well tolerated and seemed more effective than in RCTs. Normal weight and a low number of failed preventives were positively associated with galcanezumab effectiveness in CM patients.

Using standard microbiological techniques, we obtained 68 caecal isolates of Escherichia coli from 10 chickens and 9 guinea fowl in rural Gambia. After Illumina whole-genome sequencing, 28 sequence types were detected in the isolates (4 of them novel), of which ST155 was the most common (22/68, 32 %). These strains span four of the eight main phylogroups of E. coli, with phylogroups B1 and A being most prevalent. Nearly a third of the isolates harboured at least one antimicrobial resistance gene, while most of the ST155 isolates (14/22, 64 %) encoded resistance to ≥3 classes of clinically relevant antibiotics, as well as putative virulence factors, suggesting pathogenic potential in humans. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering revealed that several Gambian poultry strains were closely related to isolates from humans. Although the ST155 lineage is common in poultry from Africa and South America, the Gambian ST155 isolates belong to a unique cgMLST cluster comprising closely related (38–39 alleles differences) isolates from poultry and livestock from sub-Saharan Africa – suggesting that strains can be exchanged between poultry and livestock in this setting. Continued surveillance of E. coli and other potential pathogens in rural backyard poultry from sub-Saharan Africa is warranted.","Foster-Nyarko, Ebenezer; Alikhan, Nabil-Fareed; Ravi, Anuradha; Thomson, Nicholas M.; Jarju, Sheikh; Kwambana-Adams, Brenda A.; Secka, Arss; O’Grady, Justin; Antonio, Martin; Pallen, Mark John",Microb Genom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8115903/,447

Here, we interrogate the value of doppler ultrasound evaluation of passive leg raising (PLR)-induced changes in stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) as a predictor of FR in children with mechanical ventilation after congenital cardiac surgery. METHODS: A total of 40 children with mechanical ventilation following congenital cardiac surgery, who required volume expansion (VE) were included in this study. Hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), SV, and central venous pressure (CVP) were monitored before and after PLR and VE. Besides, we assessed changes in SV and CO by bedside ultrasound. Patients showing > 10 % increase in SV in response to VE were considered to be responders (26 patients), while the rest (14 patients) were defined as non-responders. RESULTS: Our data demonstrated that ΔSV-PLR and ΔCO- PLR were positively correlated with ΔSV-VE (r = 0.683, p < 0.001 and r = 0.374, p = 0.017, respectively), and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of ΔSV-PLR was 0.879 (95 % CI [0.745 1.000], p < 0.001). The best cut-off value for ΔSV-PLR in predicting FR was 13 %, with its sensitivity and specificity were 81.8 and 86.3 %, respectively. ΔCVP, ΔHR, and ΔMAP were weak predictors of FR in the children. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that SV changes, as evaluated by noninvasive ultrasound combined with PLR, could effectively evaluate FR in children under mechanical ventilation after congenital cardiac surgery.","Luo, Deqiang; Dai, Wei; Lei, Lei; Cai, Xueying",BMC Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8132037/,447

In contrast to the inpatient setting, adequate interpreters are often not readily available in emergency services. At the same time, however, emergency situations require rapid assessment as the basis for any treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A smartphone app that enables basic communication in 18 languages using 600 different phrases was piloted over a period of 6 months in four emergency medical service stations. Finally, the usability of the app was evaluated by the whole rescue service staff in a questionnaire study using the System Usability Score and the AttrakDiff questionnaire. RESULTS: The response rate was 48.5% and n = 48 questionnaires were evaluated. The average age of the respondents was 36 years and almost two-thirds were male. The System Usability Score showed a median of 67.5 points, indicating borderline good usability. The AttrakDiff questionnaire showed pragmatic quality with an average of 0.69 (SD 0.86), hedonic quality with 0.59 (SD 0.58), and attractiveness (ATT) with 0.64 points (SD 0.83). The average values show satisfying results above the neutral limit of 0. It was observed that those rescue workers who stated that they had already actively used the app with patients rated the app significantly better. DISCUSSION: Given that the app studied is a complex work tool, its usability and attractiveness were rated as overall good, and paramedics who had already used the app rated it even more positively. This could indicate a hesitancy by some paramedics to use a complex digital tool in complex situations that are already characterized by language and cultural barriers.","Müller, Frank; Hummers, Eva; Schulze, Jennifer; Noack, Eva Maria",Notf Rett Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8251687/,447
19373,Operationsvorbereitung in der Unfallchirurgie,2021-07-22,"Research studies that focus on understanding the onset of neurodegenerative pathology and therapeutic interventions to inhibit its causative factors, have shown a crucial role of olfactory bulb neurons as they transmit and propagate nerve impulses to higher cortical and limbic structures. In rodent models, removal of the olfactory bulb results in pathology of the frontal cortex that shows striking similarity with frontal cortex features of patients diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders. Widely different approaches involving behavioral symptom analysis, histopathological and molecular alterations, genetic and environmental influences, along with age-related alterations in cellular pathways, indicate a strong correlation of olfactory dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Indeed, declining olfactory acuity and olfactory deficits emerge either as the very first symptoms or as prodromal symptoms of progressing neurodegeneration of classical conditions. Olfactory dysfunction has been associated with most neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric, and communication disorders. Evidence revealing the dual molecular function of the olfactory receptor neurons at dendritic and axonal ends indicates the significance of olfactory processing pathways that come under environmental pressure right from the onset.

19990,Künstliche Intelligenz in der Hals-Nasen-Ohren-Heilkunde,2021-08-10,"IMPORTANCE: The effectiveness of stool-based colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, including fecal immunochemical tests (FITs), relies on colonoscopy completion among patients with abnormal results, but in safety net systems and federally qualified health centers, in which FIT is frequently used, colonoscopy completion within 1 year of an abnormal result rarely exceeds 50%. Clinician-identified factors in follow-up of abnormal FIT results are understudied and could lead to more effective interventions to address this issue. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinician-identified barriers and facilitators to colonoscopy completion among patients with abnormal FIT results in a safety net health care system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study was conducted using semistructured key informant interviews with primary care physicians (PCPs) and staff members in a large safety net health care system in Washington state. Eligible clinicians were recruited through all-staff meetings and clinic medical directors. Interviews were conducted from February to December 2020 through face-to-face interactions or digital meeting platforms. Interview transcripts were analyzed deductively and inductively using a content analysis approach. Data were analyzed from September through December 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Barriers and facilitators to colonoscopy completion after an abnormal FIT result were identified by PCPs and staff members. RESULTS: Among 21 participants, there were 10 PCPs and 11 staff members; 20 participants provided demographic information. The median (interquartile range) age was 38.5 (33.0-51.5) years, 17 (85.0%) were women, and 9 participants (45.0%) spent more than 75% of their working time engaging in patient care. All participants identified social determinants of health, organizational factors, and patient cognitive factors as barriers to colonoscopy completion. Participants suggested that existing resources that addressed these factors facilitated colonoscopy completion but were insufficient to meet national follow-up colonoscopy goals. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this qualitative study, responses of interviewed PCPs and staff members suggested that the barriers to colonoscopy completion in a safety net health system may be modifiable. These findings suggest that interventions to improve follow-up of abnormal FIT results should be informed by clinician-identified factors to address multilevel challenges to colonoscopy completion.","Issaka, Rachel B.; Bell-Brown, Ari; Snyder, Cyndy; Atkins, Dana L.; Chew, Lisa; Weiner, Bryan J.; Strate, Lisa; Inadomi, John M.; Ramsey, Scott D.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8356069/,447

20708,Neues zur Diagnostik und Therapie der Herzinsuffizienz,2021-08-31,"BACKGROUND: Leg ulcers are open skin wounds on the lower leg that can last weeks, months or even years. Most leg ulcers are the result of venous diseases. First‐line treatment options often include the use of compression bandages or stockings. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of using compression bandages or stockings, compared with no compression, on the healing of venous leg ulcers in any setting and population. SEARCH METHODS: In June 2020 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (including In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta‐analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions by language, date of publication or study setting. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials that compared any types of compression bandages or stockings with no compression in participants with venous leg ulcers in any setting. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently assessed studies using predetermined inclusion criteria. We carried out data extraction, and risk‐of‐bias assessment using the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool. We assessed the certainty of the evidence according to GRADE methodology. MAIN RESULTS: We included 14 studies (1391 participants) in the review. Most studies were small (median study sample size: 51 participants). Participants were recruited from acute‐care settings, outpatient settings and community settings, and a large proportion (65.9%; 917/1391) of participants had a confirmed history or clinical evidence of chronic venous disease, a confirmed cause of chronic venous insufficiency, or an ankle pressure/brachial pressure ratio of greater than 0.8 or 0.9. The average age of participants ranged from 58.0 to 76.5 years (median: 70.1 years). The average duration of their leg ulcers ranged from 9.0 weeks to 31.6 months (median: 22.0 months), and a large proportion of participants (64.8%; 901/1391) had ulcers with an area between 5 and 20 cm(2). Studies had a median follow‐up of 12 weeks. Compression bandages or stockings applied included short‐stretch bandage, four‐layer compression bandage, and Unna's boot (a type of inelastic gauze bandage impregnated with zinc oxide), and comparator groups used included 'usual care', pharmacological treatment, a variety of dressings, and a variety of treatments where some participants received compression (but it was not the norm). Of the 14 included studies, 10 (71.4%) presented findings which we consider to be at high overall risk of bias. Primary outcomes There is moderate‐certainty evidence (downgraded once for risk of bias) (1) that there is probably a shorter time to complete healing of venous leg ulcers in people wearing compression bandages or stockings compared with those not wearing compression (pooled hazard ratio for time‐to‐complete healing 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52 to 3.10; I(2) = 59%; 5 studies, 733 participants); and (2) that people treated using compression bandages or stockings are more likely to experience complete ulcer healing within 12 months compared with people with no compression (10 studies, 1215 participants): risk ratio for complete healing 1.77, 95% CI 1.41 to 2.21; I(2) = 65% (8 studies with analysable data, 1120 participants); synthesis without meta‐analysis suggests more completely‐healed ulcers in compression bandages or stockings than in no compression (2 studies without analysable data, 95 participants). It is uncertain whether there is any difference in rates of adverse events between using compression bandages or stockings and no compression (very low‐certainty evidence; 3 studies, 585 participants). Secondary outcomes Moderate‐certainty evidence suggests that people using compression bandages or stockings probably have a lower mean pain score than those not using compression (four studies with 859 participants and another study with 69 ulcers): pooled mean difference −1.39, 95% CI −1.79 to −0.98; I(2) = 65% (two studies with 426 participants and another study with 69 ulcers having analysable data); synthesis without meta‐analysis suggests a reduction in leg ulcer pain in compression bandages or stockings, compared with no compression (two studies without analysable data, 433 participants). Compression bandages or stockings versus no compression may improve disease‐specific quality of life, but not all aspects of general health status during the follow‐up of 12 weeks to 12 months (four studies with 859 participants; low‐certainty evidence). It is uncertain if the use of compression bandages or stockings is more cost‐effective than not using them (three studies with 486 participants; very low‐certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: If using compression bandages or stockings, people with venous leg ulcers probably experience complete wound healing more quickly, and more people have wounds completely healed. The use of compression bandages or stockings probably reduces pain and may improve disease‐specific quality of life. There is uncertainty about adverse effects, and cost effectiveness. Future research should focus on comparing alternative bandages and stockings with the primary endpoint of time to complete wound healing alongside adverse events including pain score, and health‐related quality of life, and should incorporate cost‐effectiveness analysis where possible. Future studies should adhere to international standards of trial conduct and reporting.","Shi, Chunhu; Dumville, Jo C; Cullum, Nicky; Connaughton, Emma; Norman, Gill",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8407020/,447

Based on various heterogeneous network model, this paper proposes a method named THNCDF for predicting drug–target interactions. Various heterogeneous networks are integrated to build a tripartite network, and similarity calculation methods are used to obtain similarity matrix. Then, the cascade deep forest method is used to make prediction. Results indicate that THNCDF outperforms the previously reported methods based on the 10-fold cross-validation on the benchmark data sets proposed by Y. Yamanishi.

20979,"Bericht der Arbeitsgemeinschaft Herz‑, Gefäß‑, Nieren- und Transplantationspathologie",2021-09-10,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Metastasis is critical to the prognosis of patients with bladder cancer, and it is important to understand the mechanism of its occurrence. S1PR1 expression is thought to be associated with poor prognosis, but it is unknown whether it is associated with tumor metastasis. Analysis of clinical gene expression data suggests that endothelial or immune cells in tumor tissue may be the source of S1PR1 expression. Comparative analysis of clinical tumor tissues with bladder cancer cells suggests that S1PR1 expression is associated with cellular adhesion. In vitro experiments demonstrated that S1PR1 expression was negatively correlated with cancer cell motility, and that S1PR1 inhibition by FTY-720 may cause an increase in cancer cell motility, suggesting that the use of S1PR1 inhibition as a synergistic therapy requires additional observations and considerations. ABSTRACT: Clinical bladder tumor histological analysis shows that high expression of S1PR1 is associated with poor patient prognosis. However, there are no studies that describe the underlying mechanism. To investigate the relative distribution and actual function of S1PR1 in bladder tumors, we analyzed multiple clinical databases in combination with tumor purity and immune cell infiltration simulations, as well as databases of well-defined histological phenotypes of bladder cancer, and single-cell sequencing of adjacent normal tissues and bladder tumors, and further compared them with bladder cancer cell lines. The results showed that S1PR1 expression was generally higher in normal tissues than in bladder cancer tissues, and its distribution was mainly in endothelial cells or immune cells. The association between high S1PR1 expression and poor prognosis may be due to tumor invasion of adjacent normal tissues, where highly expressed S1PR1 may affect prognostic interpretation. The effect of S1PR1 itself on cancer cells was associated with cell adhesion, and in bladder cancer cells, S1PR1 expression was negatively correlated with cell motility. Moreover, the use of FTY-720 will cause an increased metastatic ability of bladder cancer cells. In conclusion, we suggest that the use of S1PR1-specific inhibition as a synergistic treatment requires more observation and consideration.","Chen, Chin-Li; Meng, En; Wu, Sheng-Tang; Lai, Hsing-Fan; Lu, Yi-Shan; Yang, Ming-Hsin; Tsao, Chih-Wei; Kao, Chien-Chang; Chiu, Yi-Lin",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8431630/,447
21240,Kratom – eine kurze Übersicht für die Schmerzmedizin,2021-09-17,"IMPORTANCE: Labor unions are purported to improve working conditions; however, little evidence exists regarding the effect of resident physician unions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of resident unions with well-being, educational environment, salary, and benefits among surgical residents in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This national cross-sectional survey study was based on a survey administered in January 2019 after the American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE). Clinically active residents at all nonmilitary US general surgery residency programs accredited by the American Council of Graduate Medical Education who completed the 2019 ABSITE were eligible for participation. Data were analyzed from December 5, 2020, to March 16, 2021. EXPOSURES: Presence of a general surgery resident labor union. Rates of labor union coverage among non–health care employees within a region were used as an instrumental variable (IV) for the presence of a labor union at a residency program. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was burnout, which was assessed using a modified version of the abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory and was defined as experiencing any symptom of depersonalization or emotional exhaustion at least weekly. Secondary outcomes included suicidality, measures of job satisfaction, duty hour violations, mistreatment, educational environment, salary, and benefits. RESULTS: A total of 5701 residents at 285 programs completed the pertinent survey questions (response rate, 85.6%), of whom 3219 (56.5%) were male, 3779 (66.3%) were White individuals, 449 (7.9%) were of Hispanic ethnicity, 4239 (74.4%) were married or in a relationship, and 1304 (22.9%) had or were expecting children. Among respondents, 690 residents were from 30 unionized programs (10.5% of programs). There was no difference in burnout for residents at unionized vs nonunionized programs (297 [43.0%] vs 2175 [43.4%]; odds ratio [OR], 0.92 [95% CI, 0.75-1.13]; IV difference in probability, 0.15 [95% CI, −0.11 to 0.42]). There were no significant differences in suicidality, job satisfaction, duty hour violations, mistreatment, educational environment, salary, or benefits except that unionized programs more frequently offered 4 weeks instead of 2 to 3 weeks of vacation (27 [93.1%] vs 52 [30.6%]; OR, 19.18 [95% CI, 3.92-93.81]; IV difference in probability, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.09-1.45]) and more frequently offered housing stipends (10 [38.5%] vs 9 [16.1%]; OR, 2.15 [95% CI, 0.58-7.95]; IV difference in probability, 0.62 [95% CI 0.04-1.20]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this evaluation of surgical residency programs in the US, unionized programs offered improved vacation and housing stipend benefits, but resident unions were not associated with improved burnout, suicidality, job satisfaction, duty hour violations, mistreatment, educational environment, or salary.","Brajcich, Brian C.; Chung, Jeanette W.; Wood, Douglas E.; Horvath, Karen D.; Tolley, Philip D.; Yates, Elizabeth F.; Are, Chandrakanath; Ellis, Ryan J.; Hu, Yue-Yung; Bilimoria, Karl Y.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8411294/,447

The intellectual challenges are greater than ever but the pace has changed. Although there are greater opportunities for therapeutic targets than ever before, the costs and risks are great and the increasingly competitive environment makes the pace of pharmaceutical drug hunting range from exciting to overwhelming. These changes are catalyzed by major changes to drug discovery processes through application of rapid parallel synthesis of large chemical libraries and high-throughput screening. These techniques result in huge volumes of data for use in decision making. Besides the size and complex nature of biological and chemical data sets and the many sources of data “noise”, the needs of business produce many, often conflicting, decision criteria and constraints such as time, cost, and patent caveats. The drive is still to find potent and selective molecules but, in recent years, key aspects of drug discovery are being shifted to earlier in the process. Discovery scientists are now concerned with building molecules that have good stability but also reasonable properties of absorption into the bloodstream, distribution and binding to tissues, metabolism and excretion, low toxicity, and reasonable cost of production. These requirements result in a high-dimensional decision problem with conflicting criteria and limited resources.

25562,Pneumonien,2008,"Proprotein convertases (PCs), also known as eukaryotic subtilases, are a group of serine proteases comprising furin (PACE), PC1 (PC3), PC2, PC4, PACE4, PC5 (PC6), and PC7 (LPC, PC8) that generate bioactive proteins and peptides, such as hormones, receptors, and growth factors by cleaving precursor proteins at multibasic motifs. Two other family members, SKI-1/S1P and PCSK9, cleave regulator proteins involved in cholesterol and fatty acid homeostasis at nonbasic peptide bonds. Furin is ubiquitous in eukaryotic tissues and cells. PACE4, PC5, and PC7 are also widespread, whereas the expression of the other PCs is more restricted. PCs are synthesized as multi-segmented zymogens which are autocatalytically activated. The prodomains have regulatory and inhibitory functions. The catalytic domains are the most conserved domains among the PCs. The architecture of the catalytic active furin domain is known in different binding states. The C-terminal parts of the PCs differ in length and structure and contain encoded peptide signatures guiding the PCs to the subcellular destinations on the secretory pathways: SKI-1/S1P to the cis-Golgi, furin, PC5B, and PC7 to the TGN region but also to the plasma membrane. PACE4, PC5A, and PCSK9 are attached at the cell surface. Truncated, soluble furin and SKI-1/S1P, as well as PC1 and PC2, are released into the extracellular matrix. Many enveloped viruses are activated by furin and furin-like PCs and arenaviruses and a few bunyaviruses by SKI-1/S1P. The PCs cleave the viral fusion glycoprotein to trigger fusion of viral envelopes with cellular membranes to deliver the viral genome into host cells. Cleavage by PCs, occasionally in concert with other endoproteases, enables conformational changes in the viral membrane proteins needed for correct oligomerization of glycoprotein spikes and their effective incorporation into virions. Mutational alterations of PC cleavage sites can reduce the fusion potential of viral surface proteins and thus facilitate the development of secure live attenuated vaccines. Alternatively, agents preventing cleavage of viral surface (glyco)proteins block fusion capacity and multicyclic virus replications. PC inhibitors are suggested as promising antiviral drugs for quite a number of viruses causing severe infections.","Garten, Wolfgang",Activation of Viruses by Host Proteases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122180/,447

The clinical evaluation of beclabuvir in combination with both the NS5A replication complex inhibitor daclatasvir and the NS3 protease inhibitor asunaprevir in a single, fixed-dose formulation (Ximency) resulted in the approval by the Japanese Pharmaceutical and Food Safety Bureau for its use in the treatment of patients infected with genotype 1 HCV.","Gentles, Robert G.",HCV: The Journey from Discovery to a Cure,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123187/,447
26362,Portale Hypertension,2011-09-26,"Aging influences an organism’s entire physiology, affecting functions at the molecular, cellular, and systemic levels and increasing susceptibility to many major chronic diseases. The changes in the immune system that accompany human aging are very complex and are generally referred to as immunosenescence. The factors and mechanisms of immunosenescence are multiple and include, among others, defects in the bone marrow, thymic involution, and intrinsic defects in the formation, maturation, homeostasis, and migration of peripheral lymphocytes. Aging affects both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The process of aging is commonly accompanied by low-grade inflammation thought to contribute to neuroinflammation and to many age-related diseases. Numerous attempts to define the role of chronic inflammation in aging have implicated chronic oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, immunosenescence, epigenetic modifications, and other phenomena. Several lifestyle strategies, such as intervening to provide an adequate diet and physical and mental activity, have been shown to result in improved immune and neuroprotective functions, a decrease in oxidative stress and inflammation, and a potential increase in individual longevity. The studies published thus far describe a critical role for nutrition in maintaining the immune response of the aged, but they also indicate the need for a more in-depth, holistic approach to determining the optimal nutritional and behavioral strategies that would maintain immune and other physiological systems in elderly people. In this chapter, we focus first on the age-related changes of the immune system. Further, we discuss possible deleterious influences of immunosenescence and low-grade inflammation (inflammaging) on neurodegenerative processes in the normally aging brain. Finally, we consider our current understanding of the modulatory potential of nutrition that may mediate anti-inflammatory effects and thus positively affect immunity and the aging brain.","Di Benedetto, Svetlana; Müller, Ludmila",Nutrition and Immunity,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123246/,447

The emerging evidence for a role of CCR2 and CCR5 receptors in human inflammatory diseases led to a growing interest in CCR2- and CCR5-selective antagonists. In this review, we focus on the recent development of selective CCR2/CCR5 receptor ligands and dual antagonists. Several compounds targeting CCR2, e.g., INCB8761 and MK0812, were developed as promising candidates for clinical trials, but failed to show clinical efficacy as presumed from preclinical models. The role of CCR5 receptors as the second co-receptor for the HIV-host cell fusion led to the development of various CCR5-selective ligands. Maraviroc is the first CCR5-targeting drug for the treatment of HIV-1 infections on the market. The role of CCR5 receptors in the progression of inflammatory processes fueled the use of CCR5 antagonists for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Unfortunately, the use of maraviroc for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis failed due to its inefficacy. Some of the ligands, e.g., TAK-779 and TAK-652, were also found to be dual antagonists of CCR2 and CCR5 receptors. The fact that CCR2 and CCR5 receptor antagonists contribute to the treatment of inflammatory diseases renders the development of dual antagonists as promising novel therapeutic strategy.","Junker, Anna; Kokornaczyk, Artur Kamil; Strunz, Ann Kathrin; Wünsch, Bernhard",Chemokines,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123309/,447

This means the computation complexity of MSA increases exponentially with the number of sequences. The presented algorithms are mostly heuristic and many of them are based on pairwise sequence alignment. Hence we begin with pairwise alignment of multiple sequences and discuss the topological space induced by pairwise alignment of multiple sequences, since different optimization criteria may lead to different results. We discuss several optimization indices here: the sum of pairs (SP); Shannon entropy; similarity rate and the rate of virtual symbols. Based on this discussion, we present a new multiple sequence alignment based on SPA called super multiple sequence alignment (SMA).

A worldwide overview of all parasites known for 48 out 86 extant euphausiid species includes 17 distinct types of epibionts, pathogens, parasites, and parasitoids. So far, only seven of them have been reported interacting with E. superba [epibionts: exuviotrophic ciliates (Foettingeriidae) and microplanktophagous ciliates (Suctoridae, Ephelota), pathogens: chitinoclastic bacteria and fungi; and trophically transmitted endoparasites: Apicomplexans (Gregarinidae, Cephaloidophora), nematode infecting krill’s eggs (under laboratory conditions), and histophagous parasites: Apostomatida ciliates of the family Pseudocollinidae]. The epibionts have interspecific associations that strongly depend on the krill’s moult cycle, discarding them at each moulting event. Their colonization and intensity show a remarkable synchronization with the krill moulting process at individual, school, and population levels. The social and sometimes highly dense swarms and schools of E. superba, its keystone trophic function (both as voracious predator and as prey to multiple predators) should make it a critical vector for trophically transmitted parasites in the food web. However, E. superba interacts with a relatively low diversity of epibionts, pathogens, and parasites, in comparison with parasite diversity known for relatively well-studied temperate (Meganyctiphanes norvegica, Euphausia pacifica) and subtropical (Nyctiphanes simplex) euphausiid species. The apparently low parasite diversity of E. superba is likely associated with its Antarctic zoogeographic pattern; where, parasites have not invaded the Antarctic krill with the same evolutionary success as have occurred with other euphausiid species from tropical, subtropical, temperate, and even Arctic ecosystems.","Gómez-Gutiérrez, Jaime; Morales-Ávila, José Raúl",Biology and Ecology of Antarctic Krill,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7153171/,447

The discovery of a new serotype, with some properties distinct from MVM, highlights the importance of employing both genetic and serotype-specific tests for the identification of murine parvoviruses (MPVs). The detection of multiple MPVs isolates indicated a need for standardized nomenclature. As with other autonomous parvoviruses, MPVs require cellular factors expressed during cell division and differentiation for productive replication. These factors are thought to account for their predilection for mitotically active cells. The simple structure of rodent parvoviruses has stimulated development of valuable reagents to detect infection. These include generic and serotype-specific antigens for use in serological tests, antibodies to viral proteins for use in immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction primers for detection of viral DNA in infected tissues and feces, and strand-specific molecular probes that help distinguish sites of active viral replication. Because MVM does not persist in immunocompetent mice, control and elimination should employ quarantine for at least 1 month, combined with thorough disinfection of the environment. Quarantine also assumes that MPV infection is ruled out. Prevention is based on sound serological monitoring of mice and surveillance of biologicals destined for inoculation of mice.","O.

31700,Epidemien und Pandemien in historischer Perspektive,2016-06-16,"Viruses survive in nature only if they are able to pass from one host to another, whether of the same or another species. Viral epidemiology is the study of the factors that determine the frequency and distribution of viral diseases in an animal population. In the broadest sense, epidemiology may be viewed as a part of population biology, involving not only environmental factors but also genetic factors in both the virus and the host. The terms incidence and prevalence are used to describe quantitative aspects of the occurrence of infections in populations. The incidence of infection is defined as the proportion of a population contracting that infection during a specified period, whereas prevalence refers to the proportion infected at a particular point in time. The comparisons of incidence and prevalence at different times and places are made by relating the appropriate numerator to a denominator that may be as general as the total population of the animal species concerned or may be specified as the susceptible population at risk. A disease is said to be enzootic when there are continuous chains of transmission in the region involved; epizootics are peaks in disease incidence. The size of the peak required to constitute an epizootic is arbitrary and is related to the background enzootic rate, the morbidity, and the anxiety that the disease arouses.","FENNER, FRANK; BACHMANN, PETER A.; GIBBS, E.

In 112 Kälber‐ (36%), 2 Ferkel‐ (4 %) und 21 (21 %) menschlichen Faezesproben konnte Rotavirus oder ‐antigen nachgewiesen werden. Die Sicherheit der Methodik wurde zusätzlich anhand der Virusausscheidung von drei experimentell infizierten, kolostrumfrei aufgezogenen Kälbern überprüft. Der ELISA, bei dem Meerrettichperoxidase als Enzym verwendet wurde, war spezifisch und erwies sich im Vergleich zur IEM als empfindlicher. Bei 18 von insgesamt 136 positiven Proben gelang der Virusnachweis nur mit der IEM, diese Proben waren negativ im ELISA. In diesen Proben werden Virus‐Antikörperkomplexe vermutet. Weitere Untersuchungen sind notwendig, bevor der ELISA zum Rotavirusnachweis in der Routinediagnostik empfohlen werden kann. SUMMARY: Demonstration of Rotavirus in Faeces: Experiences with the Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 313 calf, 47 piglet and 100 human faecal samples from newborn patients with diarrhea were investigated comparing a modified immune electron microscopy method and the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In 112 (36 %) calf, 2 (4 %) piglet and 21 (21 %) human samples rotavirus or its antigen could be demonstrated. The suitability of the method was also tested by studying virus shedding of three experimentally infected, colostrum‐deprived calves. The ELISA, using horse‐radish peroxidase as enzyme and 5 amino‐salicylic acid as indicator, was very specific and showed a higher sensitivity compared to IEM. In 18 out of the 136 positive samples rotavirus could only be demonstrated by IEM; these samples were negative in the ELISA. It is assumed that these samples contain virus‐antibody complexes. Further investigations are necessary before the ELISA can be recommended as a routine diagnostic test.

Die Versuche ergaben, daß eine Schutzwirkung nur durch eine hohe Antigenkonzentration in der Vakzine erreicht wird und nicht durch die Verwendung eines größeren Volumens mit geringerer Antigenkonzentration. Weiterhin war in Hühnerembryonen gewonnenes Virus wegen seiner vermutlich größeren Stabilität überlegen. Die Schutzwirkung der vernebelten Vakzinen war proportional zu der Vakzinemenge, die in Tröpfchengrößen unter 5 μm vorlag. Optimale Immunität wurde erst durch Expositionszeiten von 2 Stunden und darüber erzielt. Dabei war der Schutz gegen die konjunktivale Infektion höher als gegen die i. m. Testinfektion. Antikörper wurden in der Regel auch in voll immunen Tiergruppen nur in Spuren und nur im Serum gefunden. Eine belastbare Immunität wurde erst durch Revakzination ausgebildet. In vergleichbaren Versuchen waren nach der ersten Aerosolvakzination nur 5 % der Tiere immun, nach der zweiten 70 % und nach der dritten 100 %.

SUMMARY: Studies on aerosol vaccination of chicks with inactivated vaccines against Newcastle Disease A study was made of whether and under what conditions immunity can be achieved by aerosols of inactivated Newcastle Disease vaccines. It was found that protection could be conferred only if a high concentration of antigen was reached in the vaccine; protection was not obtainable with a large volume of lower antigen concentration. Furthermore virus from chick embryos was superior, on account of its probably greater stability. The protective effect of the various aerosol vaccines was proportional to the amount of vaccine present in droplets under 5 μm. in size. Optimal immunity results from an exposure time of two hours and longer. The resulting protection was greater against conjunctival infection than against intramuscular challenge. Even in fully immune groups of birds antibodies were present only in traces and only in serum. A lasting immunity was only achieved by revaccination. In comparative studies only 5 % of the birds were immune after a single vaccination, 70 % after a second, and 100 % after the third vaccination. The practical value of vaccination with aerosols made from inactivated vaccine against ND is discussed in the light of the various limitations. RÉSUMÉ: Recherches sur une vaccination par aérosol de poussins avec un vaccine inactivé contre la maladie de Newcastle On a voulu savoir dans quelle mesure une immunité pouvait être atteinte avec des aérosols de vaccin inactivé contre la maladie de Newcastle. Les recherches ont montré qu'une protection pouvait être atteinte avec une forte concentration d'antigène et non avec un grand volume d'une concentration antigénique plus faible. Le virus fut isolé sur embryon de poulet étant donné une plus grande stabilité probable. L'action de protection du vaccin‐aérosol fut proportionnelle à la quantité de vaccin, les gouttelettes étant de l'ordre de grandeur de 5 μm. Une immunité optimale fut obtenue seulement avec des temps d'exposition de 2 heures et plus. La protection contre l'infection conjonctivale fut plus élevée que contre l'infectiontest i/m. Des anticorps ne furent trouvés qu'en traces et dans le sérum dans des groupes d'animaux totalement immunisés. Une immunité measurable ne fut trouvée qu'après une revaccination. Des recherches comparées ont montré que le 5 % des animaux étaient immunisés après la première vaccination par aérosol, le 70 % après la deuxième et le 100 % après la troisième. L'application pratique de la vaccination par aérosol avec des vaccines inactivés contre la maladie de Newcastle est discutée en rapport avec les conditions limitées. RESUMEN: Ensayos sobre la vacunación aerosólica de pollitos con vacunas inactivadas contra la enfermedad de Newcastle Se estudió si y bajo qué clase de condiciones se puede conseguir una inmunidad contra la enfermedad de Newcastle con aerosoles de vacunas inactivadas. Los ensayos tuvieron por resultado que se consigue una acción protectora solo mediante una concentración antigénica elevada en la vacuna y no empleando un volumen mayor con concentración antigénica escasa. Además era superior el virus obtenido en embriones de pollo, debido, tal vez, a su gran estabilidad. La acción protectora de las vacunas atomizadas era proporcional a la cantidad de vacuna presente en gotas de tamaños inferiores a 5 μm. La inmunidad óptima se consigue solo mediante tiempos de exposición de 2 horas y más. De esta guisa era mayor la protección frente a la infección conjunctival que frente a la infección im. de prueba. Por regla general, no se encontraron anticuerpos más que en grupos de animales con inmunidad plena y sólo en el suero sanguíneo. La inmunidad gravable se formó únicamente por medio de revacunación. En ensayos comparativos sólo se hallaba inmunizado tras vacunación aerosólica primera el 5 % de los animales, tras la segunda el 70 % y tras la tercera el 100 %. Se discute la aplicabilidad práctica de la vacunación por atomización de una vacuna inactivada contra la EN con respecto a las condiciones restrictivas.","Bauer, K.; Neukirch, M.; Müller, H.",J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7194092/,447

We propose to consider the minimal size of a corresponding DFAO as the complexity measure of the automatic sequence, for both variants. This paper compares these complexity measures and investigates their properties like the relationships with kernel and morphic sequences. There exist automatic sequences for which the one complexity is exponentially greater than the other one, in both directions. For both complexity measures we investigate the effect of taking basic operations on sequences like removing or adding an element in front, and observe that these operations may increase the complexity by at most a quadratic factor.","Zantema, Hans",Language and Automata Theory and Applications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206635/,447

The argument of Liu and Weiner, however, works only on bounded languages of particular forms, and therefore Wotschke’s result cannot be extended to disprove any other language to be written in the form of an intersection of d deterministic context-free languages. To deal with the non-membership of a wide range of languages, we circumvent their proof argument and instead devise a new, practical technical tool: a pumping lemma for finite unions of deterministic context-free languages. Since the family of deterministic context-free languages is closed under complementation, this pumping lemma enables us to show a non-membership relation of languages made up with finite intersections of even non-bounded languages as well.

The impact of awareness diffusion on the epidemic threshold is investigated under the framework of activity-driven network. Results show that the local epidemic situation in risk perception and the duration of preventive effect are crucial for raising the epidemic threshold.

In order to find new biological activities and to eventually enhance the before observed effects, (−)-polyalthic acid (1) and kaurenoic acid (2), together with eight prepared semi-synthetic derivatives (1a–1c and 2a–2e) were evaluated for their cytotoxic, antibacterial and antifungal properties. Regarding the gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecium and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, we found that both the exocylic methylene group and the carboxyl group were crucial for the activity against these two clinically relevant bacterial strains. Investigation of the antifungal activity, in contrast, showed that the carboxyl group is unnecessary for the effect against the dermatophytes Trichophyton rubrum and Cryptococcus neoformans, indicated by low micromolar IC(50) values for both (−)-polyalthic acid diethylamide (1a) as well as (−)-polyalthic acid methyl ester (1b).

These can be similar to micro-/nano-multiscale textured surfaces that have anti-biofouling properties. Fullerene-coated surfaces can be seen as a possible solution to decrease the adhesion of virus on the surface, as they will be hydrophobic as well as toxic to the envelope.","Siddiquie, Reshma Y.; Agrawal, Amit; Joshi, Suhas S.",Trans Indian Natl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223978/,447

This exploratory approach is based on information, whilst information systems and services contribute to developing new practices, creating new situations, generating new added value. In this perspective, information and knowledge can be viewed as information common good, which is in the heart of service design. It is essential that services are designed in an exploratory way, by involving multidisciplinary, multi-institutional, even multi-national actors, whose active participation would lead to the development of new value-added services.

However, the pervasion of machines in everyday life requires that the non-humans are increasingly closer in their abilities to the ordinary thought, action and behaviour of the humans. This view merges the idea of the Humaniter, a longstanding myth in the history of technology: an artificial creature that thinks, acts and feels like a human to the point that one cannot make the difference between the two. In the wake of the opposition of Strong AI and Weak AI, this challenge can be expressed in terms of a shift from the performance of intelligence (reason, reasoning, cognition, judgment) to that of sentience (experience, sensation, emotion, consciousness). In other words, the challenge of technology if this possible shift is taken seriously is to move from the paradigm of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to that of Artificial Sentience (AS). But for the Humaniter not to be regarded as a mere myth, any intelligent or sentient machine must pass through a Test of Humanity that refers to or that differs from the Turing Test. One can suggest several options for this kind of test and also point out some conditions and limits to the very idea of the Humaniter as an artificial human.","Lavelle, Sylvain",Advanced Information Systems Engineering Workshops,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7225510/,447

The principle is using the domain to make the logical isolation for different clients and data sources and applying the pre-defined data sharing rules for safe access. In the proposed MES integration framework model, the data interoperation between MES and the engineering software systems is discussed which includes ERP (Enterprise Resource Management), CAPP (Computer Aided Process Planning), DNC (Distribution Numerical Control), WMS (Warehouse Management System), and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition), etc., the implementation method of personalized data display GUI is discussed as well. The study is based on the KMMES developed by Wuhan KM-Software of China, and it has been deployed in over forty companies from the sections of aerospace, automotive, shipbuilding and other industries.","Wei, Shuangyu; Bai, Yuewei; Xu, Lai; Mu, Hua; Liu, Kai; Wang, Xiaogang",Advanced Information Systems Engineering Workshops,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7225516/,447

The model was developed using three iterations of the CRoss-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology, each focusing on a different regression approach. To reduce the ML analyst effort, an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) was adopted during the modeling stage of CRISP-DM. The AutoML was set to select the best among six distinct state-of-the-art regression algorithms. Using recent real-world data, the three main regression approaches were compared, showing that the proposed two-stage ML model is competitive and provides interesting predictions to support the laboratory management decisions (e.g., preparation of testing instruments).

We aim to evaluate the robotic transabdominal preperitoneal ventral hernia repair (rTAPP-VHR) learning curve based on operative times while accounting for peritoneal flap integrity. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a database collected over a 7-year period. Patients with primary ventral hernias were included and a cumulative sum analysis(CUSUM) was used to create learning curves for three subsets of operative times. A risk-adjusted CUSUM (RA-CUSUM) accounted for repair quality based on peritoneal flap completeness. The flap was considered as incomplete when peritoneal gaps were unable to be closed. RESULTS: 105 patients undergoing rTAPP-VHR were included. Learning curves were created for skin-to-skin, console, and off-console times. Patients were divided into three phases. In terms of skin-to-skin times, both phase 2&3 had a mean 11 min shorter than that of phase 1 (p = 0.0498, p = 0.0245, respectively), with a steady decrease after forty-six cases. An incomplete peritoneal flap was noted in 25/36 patients in phase 1, as compared to 5/24 and 5/45 patients in phase 2&3, respectively. When risk-adjusted for peritoneal flap completeness, gradually decreasing skin-to-skin times were observed after sixty-one cases. In terms of off-console times, the mean across three phases was 14 min, with marked improvement after forty-three cases. CONCLUSIONS: Forty-six cases were needed to achieve steadily decreasing operative times. We can assume that ensuring good-quality repairs, through maintenance of peritoneal flap integrity, was gradually improved after sixty-one cases. Moreover, familiarization with port placements and robotic docking was accomplished after forty-three cases.","Kudsi, O. Y.; Gokcal, F.; Bou-Ayash, N.; Crawford, A. S.; Chung, S.

The reviewers spammers generally work collaboratively under group of spammers to take control of reviews given to some products, which seriously damage the review system. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel method aim to detect group spammers while relying on various group spamming behavioral indicators.

The production supply chains have been massively disturbed. It is estimated that a significant number of Fortune 1000 firms have been severely affected by the pandemic. Manufacturing companies operating in and through India are also affected by Covid-19. However, Covid-19 also offers an opportunity to revisit the competitiveness of Indian manufacturing. Traditionally, India’s manufacturing growth has been based mostly on its domestic market. The disruptions due to Covid-19 are likely to offer new models of working and at the same time, opportunities to build capabilities and explore new international markets. The paper gives a perspective on Indian manufacturing involving various stakeholders such as industry associations, professional bodies, academic institutes, and industry to tackle the issue of enhancing manufacturing competitiveness. In a post-Covid-19, India will have to decide a mix of conventional manufacturing facilities, the automated special purpose, and industry 4.0. One perspective is to have an increased level of automation and implementation of Industry 4.0, with localized skills and global aspirations and another view is to have traditional manufacturing facilities that can ramp up its capabilities to satisfy increased demand of products.

One way to sidestep this issue is to start with simple communication and fault models, and use them as building blocks to derive the complex models studied in the field. We thus define operations like union, succession or repetition, which makes it easier to build complex models from simple ones while retaining expressivity. To formalize this approach, we abstract away the complex models and operations in the Heard-Of model. This model relies on (possibly asynchronous) rounds; sequence of digraphs, one for each round, capture which messages sent at a given round are received before the receiver goes to the next round. A set of sequences, called a heard-of predicate, defines the legal communication behaviors – that is to say, a model of communication. Because the proposed operations behave well with this transformation of operational models into heard-of predicates, we can derive bounds, characterizations, and implementations of the heard-of predicates for the constructions.","Shimi, Adam; Hurault, Aurélie; Queinnec, Philippe","Formal Techniques for Distributed Objects, Components, and Systems",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7281860/,447

Therefore, we conducted a geospatial and hot spot analysis to examine the association between villages with high TST-positive prevalence (⩾6.5%) and access to medical care (distance (in kilometres and minutes of travel time) to the municipal Rural Health Units (RHU)), access to healthcare resources (distance to Provincial Health Office (PHO)) and socioeconomic determinants of health. Hot spot analysis revealed significant clusters of TST-positive prevalence in villages farthest from the PHO. Based on univariate analysis, the following variables associated with high prevalence were included in the multivariate model: minutes of travel time to the PHO, distance to the PHO, island villages and total deprivation based on socioeconomic indicators. In the final model, only distance to PHO in minutes was significant (P = 0.005). When evaluated further, greater than 1-hour drive significantly increased risk for TST-positivity (P = 0.003). Distance to healthcare resources likely increases the risk of TB transmission within the community. Expanding TB control efforts to geographically isolated areas is critical.","Leining, L.

METHODS: This retrospective study consisted of 202 eyes of 118 myopic (SD: 2.41, range: − 1.50 to − 12.75 D) patients (44 males, 74 females). Mean age was 28.50 years (SD: 6.45, range: 18 to 51 years) that underwent ASLA with accelerated CXL for the treatment of their myopia. RESULTS: The patients underwent routine postoperative assessment on the 1st, 3rd, 7th day and in the 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th month, 30th month (±6 months), 4th and 5th year. The mean spherical equivalent (SEq) refractive error changed from − 6.41 ± 2.41 D preoperatively to − 0.02 ± 0.53 D at 5 years postoperatively. The haze score was 0.18, 0.25 and 0.28 at 1, 3 and 6 months postoperatively. At 12 months after the treatment, no eyes had significant corneal haze and in all the following postoperative time intervals the haze traces were gone. CONCLUSION: ASLA combined with accelerated CXL (ASLA-XTRA) appears to be safe, efficacious and offering very good refractive results. The potential additional benefits of this modality are the stabilizing effect of the refraction and its sterilization effect on the treated cornea without the potential side effects of MMC.","Aslanides, Ioannis M.; Hafezi, Farhad; Chen, Shihao; Mukherjee, Hatch; Selimis, Vasileios; Maragkos, Ilias; Lu, Nanji; Kymionis, George",Eye Vis (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7286704/,447

It frequently finds interactions which remain undetected by standard model-based methods. However in the previous studies application of interaction information was limited by lack of appropriate statistical tests. We study a challenging problem of testing the positiveness of interaction information which allows to confirm the statistical significance of the investigated interactions. It turns out that commonly used chi-squared test detects too many spurious interactions when the dependence between the variables (e.g. between two genetic markers) is strong. To overcome this problem we consider permutation test and also propose a novel HYBRID method that combines permutation and chi-squared tests and takes into account dependence between studied variables. We show in numerical experiments that, in contrast to chi-squared based test, the proposed method controls well the actual significance level and in many situations detects interactions which are undetected by standard methods. Moreover HYBRID method outperforms permutation test with respect to power and computational efficiency.

After classifying the optimal non-dominated solutions in the current generation as real data, the generative adversarial network (GAN) is trained by them, with the purpose of learning their distribution information. The Adam algorithm that employs the adaptively learning rate for each parameter is introduced to update the main parameters of GAN. Following that, an offspring reproduction strategy is designed to form a new feasible solution from the decimal output of the generator. To further verify the rationality of the proposed method, it is applied to solve the participant selection problem of the crowdsensing and the detailed offspring reproduction strategy is given.

By combining the Siamese network to predict the next frame target position, and adding the target’s motion trajectory information, the direction of the target motion is given more weight, the other directions are given a smaller weight, and finally the target position is predicted by the density clustering method. The results show that the proposed algorithm effectively improves the accuracy of the target location prediction of the Siamese network when tracking targets.","Chen, Jinlong; Zeng, Qinghao; Qin, Xingguo",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354830/,447
36781,Ivy: A Multi-modal Verification Tool for Distributed Algorithms,2020-06-16,"The Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP) has many real-world applications and practical values. The objective of DVRP is to find the optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles to service the given customer requests, without violating the vehicle capacity constraint. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm is proposed for solving the DVRP with the objective to minimize the total distance of the vehicles. The Brain Storm Optimization in objective space (BSO-OS) is applied to guide the choice of different strategies for the periodic reoptimization of routes. In the BSO-OS procedure, Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) and Ant Colony System (ACS) are used to generate new solutions. The experiments on the DVRP benchmark and comparative studies are conducted, from which 12 out of 21 new best solutions are obtained by the proposed algorithm, and the other nine solutions are also very competitive. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is very effective and competitive.","Liu, Mingde; Shen, Yang; Shi, Yuhui",Advances in Swarm Intelligence,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354831/,447
36789,Automated and Scalable Verification of Integer Multipliers,2020-06-13,"BACKGROUND: Thyroid infection is rare in paediatric age group in anatomically normal thyroid gland. However, acute suppurative thyroiditis (AST) is common in high-risk cases like thyroglossal duct remnant and thyroglossal pyriform sinus fistula. This may be associated with variable thyroid dysfunctions. Though transient hyperthyroidism is reported in some cases, its association was not documented in thalassemia child. CASE PRESENTATION: We are reporting an 8-year-old male child with a history of fever, pain, and left neck swelling for 5 days. He was evaluated and empirically started intravenous antibiotics (ceftriaxone, cloxacillin, and amikacin) along with other supportive treatment for localized signs of thyroid infection. Ultrasonography of the neck revealed intercommunicating pockets of collections with internal echoes in the left thyroid lobe. CT neck was done and suggested that the left lobe of the thyroid gland was replaced by hypodense lesions of fluid attenuation without any congenital abnormality of the thyroid gland. His thyroid function tests were suggestive of biochemical hyperthyroidism. He was treated with intravenous antibiotics and ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration of pus. His pus culture showed growth of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. He also had microcytic hypochromic anaemia which was evaluated and found to have thalassemia trait. His biochemical hyperthyroidism normalized after completion of 2 weeks of treatment and required no intervention. CONCLUSION: Acute suppurative thyroiditis is an uncommon clinical condition in an anatomically normal thyroid gland which could be associated with thyroid dysfunction. Its association in a thalassemia child is also not documented in literature. Clinical evaluation and proper history taking and non-invasive thyroid imaging are the cornerstone for diagnosis. Antibiotics and pus drainage are the mainstay management. Associated biochemical hyperthyroidism is transient and resolves without any specific medication in asymptomatic cases.","Sahoo, Swaranjika; Biswal, Basudev; Mohapatra, Anuspandana; Sarangi, Rachita",Egypt Pediatric Association Gaz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7354861/,447

36829,Widest Paths and Global Propagation in Bounded Value Iteration for Stochastic Games,2020-06-16,"BACKGROUND: In critically ill patients, the use of high tigecycline dosages (HD TGC) (200 mg/day) has been recently increasing but few pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data are available. We designed a prospective observational study to describe the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile of HD TGC in a cohort of critically ill patients with severe infections. RESULTS: This was a single centre, prospective, observational study that was conducted in the 20-bed mixed ICU of a 1500-bed teaching hospital in Rome, Italy. In all patients admitted to the ICU between 2015 and 2018, who received TGC (200 mg loading dose, then 100 mg q12) for the treatment of documented infections, serial blood samples were collected to measure steady-state TGC concentrations. Moreover, epithelial lining fluid (ELF) concentrations were determined in patients with nosocomial pneumonia. Amongst the 32 non-obese patients included, 11 had a treatment failure, whilst the other 21 subjects successfully eradicated the infection. There were no between-group differences in terms of demographic aspects and main comorbidities. In nosocomial pneumonia, for a target AUC(0-24)/MIC of 4.5, 75% of the patients would be successfully treated in presence of 0.5 mcg/mL MIC value and all the patients obtained the PK target with MIC ≤ 0.12 mcg/mL. In intra-abdominal infections (IAI), for a target AUC(0-24)/MIC of 6.96, at least 50% of the patients would be adequately treated against bacteria with MIC ≤ 0.5 mcg/mL. Finally, in skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTI), for a target AUC(0-24)/MIC of 17.9 only 25% of the patients obtained the PK target at MIC values of 0.5 mcg/mL and less than 10% were adequately treated against germs with MIC value ≥ 1 mcg/mL. HD TGC showed a relevant pulmonary penetration with a median and IQR ELF/plasma ratio (%) of 152.9 [73.5–386.8]. CONCLUSIONS: The use of HD TGC is associated with satisfactory plasmatic and pulmonary concentrations for the treatment of severe infections due to fully susceptible bacteria (MIC < 0.5 mcg/mL). Even higher dosages and combination strategies may be suggested in presence of difficult to treat pathogens, especially in case of SSTI and IAI.","De Pascale, Gennaro; Lisi, Lucia; Ciotti, Gabriella Maria Pia; Vallecoccia, Maria Sole; Cutuli, Salvatore Lucio; Cascarano, Laura; Gelormini, Camilla; Bello, Giuseppe; Montini, Luca; Carelli, Simone; Di Gravio, Valentina; Tumbarello, Mario; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Navarra, Pierluigi; Antonelli, Massimo",Ann Intensive Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7357259/,447

Also, to develop a metric to identify most prevalent comorbidities in people with T2D. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Primary and secondary care, England, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 108 588 people with T2D and 528 667 comparators registered in 391 English general practices. Each patient with T2D aged ≥16 years between January 2004 and December 2014 registered in Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD practices was matched to up to five comparators without diabetes on age, gender and general practice. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of 18 physical and mental health comorbidities in people with T2D and comparators categorised by age, gender and deprivation. Odds for association between T2D diagnosis and comorbidities versus comparators. A metric for comorbidities with prevalence of ≥5% and/or odds ≥2 in patients with T2D. RESULTS: Overall, 77% of patients with T2D had ≥1 comorbidity and all comorbidities were more prevalent in patients with T2D than in comparators. Across both groups, prevalence rates were higher in older people, women and those most socially deprived. Conditional logistic regression models fitted to estimate (OR, 95% CI) for association between T2D diagnosis and comorbidities showed that T2D diagnosis was significantly associated with higher odds for all conditions including myocardial infarction (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.85 to 2.46); heart failure (OR 2.12, 1.84 to 2.43); depression (OR 1.75, 1.62 to 1.89), but non-significant for cancer (OR 1.12, 0.98 to 1.28). In addition to cardiovascular disease, the metric identified osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism, anxiety, schizophrenia and respiratory conditions as highly prevalent comorbidities in people with T2D. CONCLUSIONS: T2D diagnosis is associated with higher likelihood of experiencing other physical and mental illnesses. People with T2D are twice as likely to have cardiovascular disease as the general population. The findings highlight highly prevalent and under-reported comorbidities in people with T2D. These findings can inform future research and clinical guidelines and can have important implications on healthcare resource allocation and highlight the need for more holistic clinical care for people with recently diagnosed T2D.","Zghebi, Salwa S; Steinke, Douglas T; Rutter, Martin K; Ashcroft, Darren M",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7358107/,447

Identification of host factors influencing in disease outcome is critical for recognition of individuals with increased risk. Investigations on the role of rs34481144A and rs12252C IFITM3 polymorphisms in influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 severity is not yet conclusively determined. This study aimed to evaluate such polymorphisms frequencies and IFITM3 levels in an infected Brazilian cohort of 314 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases and its putative association with clinical, epidemiological and virological data. Individuals were clinically classified into mild, severe and fatal cases. IFITM3 polymorphisms were detected by specific Taqman probes in real time PCR reactions. IFITM3 levels were determined by quantitative real time PCR. Thus, the different clinical groups presented similar distribution of rs34481144 and rs12252 genotypes and allelic frequencies. There was no significant association between the polymorphisms with severity of disease by using distinct genetic models. Additionally, geographic distribution of mutants showed that rs34481144A allele was more predominant in Brazilian Southern region. In contrast, rs12252C allele presented similar frequencies in all regions. Individuals with the distinct rs34481144 and rs12252 genotypes showed similar levels of IFITM3 and viral load in their respiratory specimens. Furthermore, IFITM3 levels were comparable in the distinct clinical groups and were not correlated with influenza viral load in analyzed samples. Thereby, rs34481144A and rs12252C polymorphisms were not associated with severity or mortality of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection nor with IFITM3 transcript levels and influenza viral load in upper respiratory tract samples in a Brazilian cohort.","Martins, Jéssica S.

Compared with PE at the time of the global financial crisis, today's $3.9 trillion private equity industry has considerably more dry powder, with more heavily capitalized strategies, including private credit and “secondaries,” more permanent capital, and stronger operational capabilities. In contrast with the pre‐crisis hyper‐competitive market environment in which purchase multiples were at record highs and returns faced significant downward pressure, the fear and uncertainty that characterize current market conditions have put PE in a position to grow its asset base at bargain prices.

Findings indicated that 96.5% of clinicians heard at least one report of discrimination from clients of color at least occasionally in counseling. The acts of discrimination most frequently reported by clients of color were: a) being made to feel like outsiders, b) treated unfairly by coworkers and classmates, and c) treated unfairly by teachers and principals. Additionally, we investigated the predictive nature of reports of discrimination from clients of color on clinicians’ compassion satisfaction, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress. The three predictor variables (clinicians’ age, years counseling, and clients of color’s reports of discrimination) did not significantly predict compassion satisfaction or burnout, yet significantly predicted secondary traumatic stress. These results revealed that as reports of discrimination from clients of color increased, so too did clinicians’ secondary traumatic stress.","Giordano, Amanda L.; Gorritz, Frank B.; Kilpatrick, Erin P.; Scoffone, Chelsea M.; Lundeen, Lindsay A.",Int J Adv Couns,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7476644/,447

This study compared the use of health services between the internal migrants who had local health insurance coverage and those who did not. Data (n = 144,956) were obtained from the 2017 China Migrants Dynamic Survey. Use of health services was assessed by two indicators: visits to physicians when needed and registration (shown as health records) for essential public health services. Multi-level logistic regression models were established to estimate the effect size of fund location on the use of health services after controlling for variations in other variables. The respondents who enrolled with a social health insurance scheme locally were more likely to visit physicians when needed (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.06–1.30) and to have a health record (AOR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.30–1.65) compared with those who enrolled outside of their residential location: a gap of 3.5 percentage points (95% CI: 1.3%–5.8%) and 6.1 percentage point (95% CI: 4.3%–7.8%), respectively. The gaps were larger in the rural-to-urban migrants than those in the urban-to-urban migrants (AOR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.93–1.48 for visiting physicians when needed; AOR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.54–0.93 for having a health record). The on-the-spot medical bill settlement system has yet to fully achieve its proposed potential as inequalities in both medical and public health services remain between the internal migrants with and without local health insurance coverage. Further studies are needed to investigate how on-the-spot settlements of medical bills are implemented through coordination across multiple insurance funds.","Yao, Qiang; Liu, Chaojie; Sun, Ju",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7504160/,447

The Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS) has been challenged to give rapid technical and scientific advices to the State and Regions on a huge variety of Sars-CoV-2 aspects related to public health. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM: Rapid and timely accumulation of knowledge and empirical evidence is critical for policymakers and emergency managers to maximally inform their decisions through scientific evidence and to better guide and mobilise the expertise of academics and general practitioners towards effective solutions. RESULTS: An ad hoc “Scientific Literature working group” at ISS in the period 23/03 - 31/05 screened a total of 4,568 pre-prints and 15,590 peer reviewed papers extracted from PubMed, arXiv.org, medRxiv and bioRxiv, which gave rise to the following deliverables: a) a daily pre-prints alert selection delivered to ISS President for the routine national Scientific Technical Committee meetings on Sars-CoV-2 chaired by Italian Civil Protection (still ongoing), and, b) a weekly open access issue of Covid Contents publications (8 volumes, https://www.iss.it/en/covid-contents), as summary of most interesting peer-reviewed papers for public health professions. LESSONS: The needed cross-cutting approach is leading to: interdisciplinarity enhancement within the ISS; coverage of broad expertise areas and interest of health care providers; cross-linkage between the different aspects/disciplines involved in this pandemic and share of experiences. KEY MESSAGES: Committed Institutions have the responsibility to support practitioners and decision makers to understand relevant aspects of medical, physical, occupational and public safety, in case of emergency.

40726,Innovationsforschung für die öffentliche Verwaltung,2020-10-12,"PROBLEM: When WHO declared COVID-19 “international”, it was important not to damage some critical patients who need emergency procedures like organ transplantation, due to end stage organ disease. In 2003 SARS outbreak demonstrated the vulnerability of organ transplantation services o network. DESCRITPTION: If transplantation is required as a life-saving procedure, it can be conducted with appropriate risk infection assessment. It is crucial during these emergencies to assess donor pool, as it is expected to decrease. A crucial point is to organize and evaluate the surge capacity, in terms of understaffing and lack of supplies, especially in ICU. The research methods were literature review using Pub Med, CDC, ECDC, WHO, TTS, searching as key words “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “transplantation”, “preparedness”. The analysis has been conducted between Feb 26th 2020 and March 5th 2020. RESULTS: As happened during SARS breakout in 2003, it is essential to establish a task force for crisis, currently updated and skilled for this particular management. Preparedness should regard especially the adoption of donor safety assessment procedures, ICU capability, the availability of covid-19 test for all the donors, and the adoption of specific post-transplant care. It is essential in this case establish preparedness in several points: education and training of the staff, practice drills, inspection of supplies, evaluation of surge capacity, relocation of patients. LESSONS: SARS-CoV-2 imposed in public health to establish new protocols and guidelines, which should be regularly updated to be useful in other epidemics outbreaks or other emergency situation. These protocols should focus on donor pool and ICU capability in order to carry on transplantation activities. KEY MESSAGES: This outbreak has tested the resilience of the whole system by day-by-day updating for transplantation teams and preparedness of the staff involved in transplantation management. During outbreak, seems to be useful a task force for crisis in order to support organ transplantation services.","Valdi, G; Varadi, G; Panzera, A; Parpinel, M; Peressutti, R",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543592/,447

We argue that by proactively regulating the amount of uncertainty one is exposed to, individuals’ future time perspective can be altered. We show how extant research might be (re)interpreted based on these considerations and suggest directions for future research, challenging a number of implicit assumptions about how age and uncertainty are interlinked.

To overcome student resistance groupwork can be useful. In addition, digital technology can be used to re-design courses to add active learning techniques and support learning with and not from technologies. We developed active learning strategies in a digital environment, artifact-generated learning (AGL). The aim of this exploratory research was to study student engagement in AGL setting by focusing on how student work together, student satisfaction, motivation, and roles. We conducted an open course with students from various disciplines. We applied Chi’s conceptual framework of the three active learning levels of active-constructive-interactive (interactive is highest level), to study the AGL intervention in student groups. Methods of focus groups, observations, and online questionnaires were conducted to analyze group interaction. Results, presented for four student groups, indicate two groups were active-constructive, one group was interactive, and one group reached beyond the highest level that we call co-design level. Implications raise awareness to distinguish between active learners and co-designers. An interactive group is not necessarily a co-designer. A co-designer is an active student who also acts beyond the given course design as s/he constructively searches for and utilizes other resources in order to accomplish set goals. To overcome student resistance, a new process-based assessment format may enhance students to become co-designers on the group level.","Jahnke, Isa; Meinke-Kroll, Michele; Todd, Michelle; Nolte, Alexander",Tech Know Learn,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7544762/,447

The major cause of fatality in infected patients, now referred to as the “Cytokine Storm Syndrome” (CSS), is a direct result of aberrant immune activation following SARS-CoV2 infection and results in excess release of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and IL-6, by macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Single cell analysis has also shown significantly elevated levels of galectin 3 (Gal-3) in macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells in patients with severe COVID-19 as compared to mild disease. Inhibition of Gal-3 reduces the release of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α from macrophages in vitro, and as such may hold promise in reducing the incidence of CSS. In addition, Gal-3 inhibition shows promise in reducing transforming growth factor ß (TGF-ß) mediated pulmonary fibrosis, likely to be a major consequence in survivors of severe COVID-19. Finally, a key domain in the spike protein of SARS-CoV2 has been shown to bind N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), a process that may be essential to cell entry by the virus. This Neu5Ac-binding domain shares striking morphological, sequence, and functional similarities with human Gal-3. Here we provide an updated review of the literature linking Gal-3 to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Dually targeting galectins and the Neu5Ac-binding domain of SARS-CoV2 shows tentative promise in several stages of the disease: preventing viral entry, modulating the host immune response, and reducing the post-infectious incidence of pulmonary fibrosis.","Caniglia, John L.; Asuthkar, Swapna; Tsung, Andrew J.; Guda, Maheedhara R.; Velpula, Kiran K.",F1000Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7536583/,447

Sentiment analyses of social media and international news media suggest that the country is perceived as a model on how to cope with the pandemic by international audiences. Unlike other public diplomacy contexts, pandemic public diplomacy challenge conventional assumptions about public diplomacy and nation branding.

We find increased responsibilities for caregiving within the household, substantial stress in responding to food insecurity, and growing expectations to fulfill public roles in disease response measures. However, we also find that the return of male migrants and youth has, in some cases, reduced women's farming responsibilities and created opportunities for household togetherness at a time of great uncertainty.

Based on comparative case study research, we posit that sovereignty is precarious in post-liberalism due to its large dependence on the technologies of responsibilization and agency.

The prevalence of COPD has increased over the last decade and the drugs most commonly used to treat it, such as glucocorticoids and bronchodilators, have significant therapeutic effects; however, they also cause side effects, including infection and immunosuppression. Here we reviewed the pathogenesis and progression of COPD and elaborated on the effects and mechanisms of newly developed molecular targeted COPD therapeutic drugs. Among these new drugs, we focussed on thioredoxin (Trx). Trx effectively prevents the progression of COPD by regulating redox status and protease/anti-protease balance, blocking the NF-κB and MAPK signalling pathways, suppressing the activation and migration of inflammatory cells and the production of cytokines, inhibiting the synthesis and the activation of adhesion factors and growth factors, and controlling the cAMP-PKA and PI3K/Akt signalling pathways. The mechanism by which Trx affects COPD is different from glucocorticoid-based mechanisms which regulate the inflammatory reaction in association with suppressing immune responses. In addition, Trx also improves the insensitivity of COPD to steroids by inhibiting the production and internalisation of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Taken together, these findings suggest that Trx may be the ideal drug for treating COPD.","Wang, Cuixue; Zhou, Jiedong; Wang, Jinquan; Li, Shujing; Fukunaga, Atsushi; Yodoi, Junji; Tian, Hai",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7588592/,447

These are, first, (primarily medical) volunteer tourism ideologies and practices in Central America, including U.S.-American teenagers volunteering in medical centers where, entirely untrained, they do sutures and injections, deliver babies, and help with amputations. Second, the paper considers and critiques local norms (e.g., widespread homophobia) and materials (e.g., the use of short-handled agricultural hoes) that may be discursively constructed as resistance to western imperialism. Finally, the critique turns back on the researcher gaze itself, problematizing the notion of academic activism in spaces, like these, where criticality itself is an imported—arguably luxurious—folly. Local people, it is apparent, do not want convoluted theorizing or Western hand-wringing; they want proper medical care. The paper therefore considers the extent to which academic work in such spaces can call itself activism at all. Three years of ethnographic research inform the paper (2013–2015, predominantly in Guatemala and Nicaragua), including hundreds of hours of interviews and participant observational fieldwork, in Spanish and English, with local stakeholders (e.g., teachers and homestay hosts) and Western volunteer tourists.

While the rise in demand has been considered as temporary, behavioral barriers and misperceptions might make these norms particularly sticky and hinder society’s ability to transition to a circular economy. Fortunately, behavioral science offers valuable insights about why the current pandemic can actually be a catalyst to create new eco-conscious behaviors. As some behaviors are often strenuous to change and require enforcement through traditional policy solutions (e.g. regulations), behavioral science offers complementary tools that will make policies more effective. We have an opportunity to start thinking about ways to leverage behavioral insights to create new norms that promote a circular economy while ultimately ensuring proper adherence to hygiene practices to curb the spread of the virus.","Makki, Fadi; Lamb, Anna; Moukaddem, Rouba",Mind Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7590251/,447

Our review of the most recent literature focuses on severity prediction, fluid resuscitation, analgesic administration, nutrition, and endoscopic intervention for SAP and its extra-pancreatic complications. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies on serum cytokines for the prediction of SAP have shown superior prognostic performance when compared with conventional laboratory tests and clinical scoring systems. In patients with established SAP and vascular leak syndrome, intravenous fluids should be administered with caution to prevent intra-abdominal hypertension and volume overload. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography improves outcomes only in AP patients with suspected cholangitis. Early enteral tube-feeding does not appear to be superior to on-demand oral feeding. Abdominal compartment syndrome is a highly lethal complication of SAP that requires percutaneous drainage or decompressive laparotomy. Endoscopic transmural drainage followed by necrosectomy (i.e., “step-up approach”) is the treatment strategy of choice in patients with symptomatic or infected walled-off pancreatic necrosis. SUMMARY: SAP is a complex clinical syndrome associated with a high mortality rate. Early prediction of SAP remains challenging due to the limited accuracy of the available prediction tools.

While means of distance learning such as online teaching appear to be feasible for theory dominant subjects addressing cognitive resources of the learner, combat-related practices like self-defense trainings don´t seem to fit into the realm of virtual learning due to their bodily foundation. This is made clear by the collective perplexity of police and civilian coaches, gyms and organizations, on how to proceed with training during the lockdown in general, while approaches of distance learning (e.g., online learning) have rarely been considered. In the following article, we tackle the situation of police and civilian self-defense coaches in times of Corona. In a first step, contextual changes and challenges of coaching self-defense are identified through the lenses of a professional coaching model. In line with basic assumptions of ecological dynamics, adaptability seems to be the decisive resource for the coaching and training of self-defense in times of Corona. As an example for such an adaptation in training practice, a conceptual framework for distance-based self-defense training in the civilian and police domain is presented. This framework is adjusted to the respective requirements of physical distancing and adopted to novel security matters within the public sphere caused by the current regulations. In sum, the article attempts to provide ideas and orientation for police and civilian self-defense coaches as well as for their own development possibilities.","Koerner, Swen; Staller, Mario S.",Secur J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7680652/,447

This study aimed to evaluate the biologic effects of ginsenoside Rb2 pretreatment on ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) in rats. METHODS: Rats were divided into four groups with 12 rats per group: control; low tidal volume (TV), TV of 6 mL/kg, VILI, TV of 20 mL/kg, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H(2)O, and respiratory rate of 60 breaths per minute for 3 h at an inspiratory oxygen fraction of 0.21; and ginsenosides, treated the same as the VILI group but with 20 mg/kg intraperitoneal ginsenoside pretreatment. Morphology was observed with a microscope to confirm the VILI model. Wet-to-dry weight ratios, protein concentrations, and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were measured. RNA sequencing of the lung tissues was conducted to analyze gene expression. RESULTS: High TV histologically induced VILI with alveolar edema and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Ginsenosides pretreatment significantly reduced the histologic lung injury score compared to the VILI group. Wet-to-dry weight ratios, malondialdehyde, and TNF-α in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were significantly higher in the VILI group and ginsenoside pretreatment mitigated these effects. In the immunohistochemistry assay, ginsenoside pretreatment attenuated the TNF-α upregulation induced by VILI. We identified 823 genes differentially presented in the VILI group compared to the control group. Of the 823 genes, only 13 genes (Arrdc2, Cygb, Exnef, Lcn2, Mroh7, Nsf, Rexo2, Srp9, Tead3, Ephb6, Mvd, Sytl4, and Ube2l6) recovered to control levels in the ginsenoside group. CONCLUSIONS: Ginsenosides inhibited the inflammatory and oxidative stress response in VILI.

42625,Wissenschaft in 5 Minuten,2020-12-07,"BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbance is common in dementia and often treated with Z-drugs (zopiclone, zaleplon, and zolpidem). While some observational studies suggest that Z-drugs are associated with adverse events such as falls and fracture risks in older people, this has not been studied in dementia. METHODS: We used data from 27,090 patients diagnosed with dementia between January 2000 and March 2016 from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to Hospital Episodes Statistics data in England. We compared adverse events for 3532 patients newly prescribed Z-drugs by time-varying dosage to (1) 1833 non-sedative-users with sleep disturbance; (2) 10,214 non-sedative-users with proximal GP consultation matched on age, sex, and antipsychotic use; and (3) 5172 patients newly prescribed benzodiazepines. We defined higher dose Z-drugs and benzodiazepines as prescriptions equivalent to ≥ 7.5 mg zopiclone or > 5 mg diazepam daily. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for incident fracture, hip fracture, fall, mortality, acute bacterial infection, ischaemic stroke/transient ischaemic attack, and venous thromboembolism over a 2-year follow-up, adjusted for demographic- and health-related covariates. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age of patients was 83 (7.7) years, and 16,802 (62%) were women. Of 3532 patients prescribed Z-drugs, 584 (17%) were initiated at higher doses. For patients prescribed higher dose Z-drugs relative to non-users with sleep disturbance, the HRs (95% confidence interval) for fractures, hip fractures, falls, and ischaemic stroke were 1.67 (1.13–2.46), 1.96 (1.16–3.31), 1.33 (1.06–1.66), and 1.88 (1.14–3.10), respectively. We observed similar associations when compared to non-sedative-users with proximal GP consultation. Minimal or inconsistent excess risks were observed at ≤ 3.75 mg zopiclone or equivalent daily, and for mortality, infection, and venous thromboembolism. We observed no differences in adverse events for Z-drugs compared to benzodiazepines, except lower mortality rates with Z-drugs (HR [95% confidence interval] of 0.73 [0.64–0.83]). CONCLUSIONS: Higher dose Z-drug use in dementia is associated with increased fracture and stroke risks, similar or greater to that for higher dose benzodiazepines. Higher dose Z-drugs should be avoided, if possible, in people living with dementia, and non-pharmacological alternatives preferentially considered. Prescriptions for higher dose Z-drugs in dementia should be regularly reviewed.

We evaluated the association of the bed-to-nurse ratio with mortality in ventilated pediatric patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: We conducted a nationwide retrospective analysis by using the Korean National Health Insurance database, which categorizes the bed-to-nurse ratio into 9 grades according to the number of beds divided by the number of full-time equivalent registered nurses in a unit. Patients of ages between 28 days and 18 years were enrolled. Multiple admissions and transfers from other hospitals were excluded. We evaluated the odds ratios (ORs) of in-hospital mortality using 4 groups (Grade 1: bed-to-nurse < 0.50, Grade 2: < 0.63, Grade 3: < 0.77, Grade 4 or above > 0.77) with adjustment of patient factors, hospital factors, and treatment requirements. RESULTS: Of the 27,849 patients admitted to ICU, 11,628 (41.8%) were on mechanical ventilation. The overall in-hospital mortality rates in Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3, and Grade 4 or above group were 4.5%, 6.8%, 6.9%, and 4.7%, respectively. The adjusted ORs (95% CI) for in-hospital mortality of mechanically ventilated patients in the Grade 2, Grade 3, and Grade 4 or above compared to those in Grade 1 were 2.73 (95% CI 1.51–4.95), 4.02 (95% CI 2.23–7.26), and 7.83 (4.07–15.07), respectively. However, for patients without mechanical ventilation, the adjusted ORs of in-hospital mortality were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: In mechanically ventilated patients, the adjusted mortality rate increased significantly, as the bed-to-nurse ratio of the ICU increased.

However, there are properties that cannot be immediately proved by means of logical relations, for instance program continuity and differentiability in higher-order languages extended with real-valued functions. Informally, the problem stems from the fact that these properties are naturally expressed on terms of non-ground type (or, equivalently, on open terms of base type), and there is no apparent good definition for a base case (i.e. for closed terms of ground types). To overcome this issue, we study a generalization of the concept of a logical relation, called open logical relation, and prove that it can be fruitfully applied in several contexts in which the property of interest is about expressions of first-order type. Our setting is a simply-typed [Formula: see text] -calculus enriched with real numbers and real-valued first-order functions from a given set, such as the one of continuous or differentiable functions. We first prove a containment theorem stating that for any collection of real-valued first-order functions including projection functions and closed under function composition, any well-typed term of first-order type denotes a function belonging to that collection. Then, we show by way of open logical relations the correctness of the core of a recently published algorithm for forward automatic differentiation. Finally, we define a refinement-based type system for local continuity in an extension of our calculus with conditionals, and prove the soundness of the type system using open logical relations.","Barthe, Gilles; Crubillé, Raphaëlle; Lago, Ugo Dal; Gavazzo, Francesco",Programming Languages and Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7702265/,447
43178,Buchmarkt,2020-12-15,"Never before in history has population aging been a driving factor in epidemics to the same extent as with the current COVID-19 pandemic, with its dramatic shift in mortality towards older age groups. The paper presents the results of an analysis of the COVID-19-related mortality data for Spain, Italy, and Sweden, which show that within the 30- to 90-year age range, the logarithms of mortality rate depend on age linearly, and all regression lines are strictly parallel to the lines corresponding to the dependencies of the general mortality on age in accordance with the Gompertz law. In all cases, irrespective of the countries and epidemic stages, the mortality doubling times within this age range are close to 7.5 years. The probabilities of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, the causative agent of COVID-19, and of the development of the clinical symptoms of infection depend on age to a much lesser extent. Based on these observations, three main points are proposed for discussion: (1) Older people have become the main victims not only of SARS-CoV-2 itself but also of the measures undertaken to prevent its spread; (2) At the same time, older people are not the main force driving the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and (3) Older people can and should participate in the fight against the pandemic and in overcoming its consequences, but not through their selective isolation and other forms of discrimination. People over 65 years of age make up a considerable segment of the population and have at least as much right as other age groups to have their needs and interests be respected and observed, including the right to as high quality of life as is accessible even in extreme situations. The prospects for full control over SARS-CoV-2 are vague. This is why those who are in charge of decisions that concern people over 65 years of age should mind that, unlike the situation in the Middle Ages, the age of 65+ is the individual future of almost everyone.","Golubev, A.

43180,Projekte aus dem Homeoffice managen,2020-12-15,"Misinformation often has an ongoing effect on people’s memory and inferential reasoning even after clear corrections are provided; this is known as the continued influence effect. In pursuit of more effective corrections, one factor that has not yet been investigated systematically is the narrative versus non-narrative format of the correction. Some scholars have suggested that a narrative format facilitates comprehension and retention of complex information and may serve to overcome resistance to worldview-dissonant corrections. It is, therefore, a possibility that misinformation corrections are more effective if they are presented in a narrative format versus a non-narrative format. The present study tests this possibility. We designed corrections that are either narrative or non-narrative, while minimizing differences in informativeness. We compared narrative and non-narrative corrections in three preregistered experiments (total N = 2279). Experiment 1 targeted misinformation contained in fictional event reports; Experiment 2 used false claims commonly encountered in the real world; Experiment 3 used real-world false claims that are controversial, in order to test the notion that a narrative format may facilitate corrective updating primarily when it serves to reduce resistance to correction. In all experiments, we also manipulated test delay (immediate vs. 2 days), as any potential benefit of the narrative format may only arise in the short term (if the story format aids primarily with initial comprehension and updating of the relevant mental model) or after a delay (if the story format aids primarily with later correction retrieval). In all three experiments, it was found that narrative corrections are no more effective than non-narrative corrections. Therefore, while stories and anecdotes can be powerful, there is no fundamental benefit of using a narrative format when debunking misinformation.","Ecker, Ullrich K.

43516,Der Stammbaum der Pandemie,2020-12-01,"Nursing education tends to focus on complex clinical issues affecting older adults who are acutely ill or in long-term care. This creates challenges for educators wanting to expose students to a greater range of experience, including realities of healthy aging. Opportunities to do things differently were presented when an established undergraduate nursing course on complex aging care underwent significant adjustment in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the course was condensed and moved online and clinical sites closed, invitations were extended to community-dwelling older people who wanted to “help teach nursing students about aging”. The response was overwhelming; over nine days, 118 people (ages 65-94) volunteered to be mentors. Through weekly online/ phone conversations, each person guided their assigned student to learn about diverse experiences of aging. Post-survey results showed the impact of these conversations. Over 90% of mentors felt they had contributed in a meaningful way to student learning and would do it again and recommend it to others. 85% of students felt it was a meaningful experience, offering comments like: “I am more mindful of my assumptions now” and “I learned to approach interactions with older adults as a collaboration; we have so much to give each other”. These results provide a needed counterpoint to the predominant COVID discourse of older people as “isolated, helpless, and needy”. Students came to understand that older people were also “engaged, active, and contributing” and identified how this had changed their view of aging.

The COVID-19 pandemic has put them at an even greater risk of not having access to such programs. While there is currently no cure, there is growing evidence that intervention programs may attenuate the progression from MCI to dementia, particularly those which 1) have potential to reduce the level of cardiovascular risk factors, 2) employ cognitively stimulating activities, and 3) create opportunities for social interaction (Petersen, Lopez, Armstrong et al., 2018; Wayne, Yeh, & Mehta, 2018; Mortimer, Ding, Borenstein et al., 2012). Many mind-body interventions, such as tai chi, yoga, and mindfulness classes, contain these three elements and have been shown to benefit individuals diagnosed with MCI, including improving cognition (e.g., Wells, Kerr, Wolkin, et al. 2013; Yang, 2016). Tele-technology (i.e., technology that supports communication between people who are not co-located) can aid in overcoming the logistical barriers by bringing instructors and interventions to these individuals to help them stay engaged and attend activities more frequently from the comfort and convenience of their home.

The Pacific Reset emphasises engagement, partnerships, and collaboration, and a greater focus on soft power, public diplomacy and people-to-people measures. It has resulted in an increase in New Zealand public diplomacy in the Pacific, including a new broadcasting initiative, and enhanced domestic public diplomacy. The language and objectives of the Pacific Reset replicate key characteristics of the New Public Diplomacy, which is frequently distinguished from the ‘old’ on the basis of two way engagement. This article argues that whilst the Pacific Reset seeks to reflect the ethos of the New Public Diplomacy, in practice, New Zealand’s Pacific public diplomacy is a mixed bag. In a contested and crowded strategic and public diplomacy environment, putting into practice a New Public Diplomacy demands a greater focus on listening.","Mark, Simon",Place Brand Public Dipl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7798375/,447

This article provides a comparative analysis of far-right responses to the COVID-19 pandemic within the European Union. Based on theoretical insights from previous research, we expect the responses to reflect the main ideology and the internal heterogeneity of the contemporary far right as well as to show the increasing mainstreaming of its positions. We analyze four different, but related, aspects: (1) the narratives about COVID-19 from far-right parties; (2) the proposed solutions of far-right parties; (3) the electoral consequences of the pandemic for far-right parties; and (4) the success of far-right parties in dealing with the pandemic.

According to the results of different studies, due to high severity of the disease, clinicians should be aware of the different potential risk factors associated with the fatal outcome, so chest CT severity scoring system was designed for semi-quantitative assessment of the severity of lung disease in COVID-19 patients, ranking the pulmonary involvement on 25 points severity scale according to extent of lung abnormalities; this study aims to evaluate retrospectively the relationship between age and severity of COVID-19 in both sexes based on chest CT severity scoring system. RESULTS: Age group C (40–49 year) was the commonest age group that was affected by COVID-19 by 21.3%, while the least affected group was group F (≥ 70 years) by only 6.4%. As regards COVID-RADS classification, COVID-RADS-3 was the most commonly presented at both sexes in all different age groups. Total CT severity lung score had a positive strong significant correlation with the age of the patient (r = 0.64, P < 0.001). Also, a positive strong significant correlation was observed between CT severity lung score and age in both males and females (r = 0.59, P < 0.001) and (r = 0.69, P < 0.001) respectively. CONCLUSION: We concluded that age can be considered as a significant risk factor for the severity of COVID-19 in both sexes. Also, CT can be used as a significant diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and evaluation of the progression and severity of the disease.","Farghaly, Shimaa; Makboul, Marwa",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7804904/,447

Quantitative studies using validated questionnaires on mental health of graduate nursing students are rare. This study aimed to investigate the factors potentially involved in the level of mental health of graduate nursing students. The sample consisted of 339 graduate nursing students from 5 universities of China. The participants were evaluated using the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) and Chinese Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS) between March and November 2020. Multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis and spearman correlation test were performed to assess the association between various factors associated with mental health. The SCL-90 total score was 109.00 (96.00 –134.00) and psychological abnormalities (total score > 160) accounted for 14.2%. The highest score in the nine dimensions was compulsion dimension. The positive detection rate of compulsion dimension was 21.5% (dimensions score > 2),and the average of compulsion score was 1.50(1.20 –2.00). Multivariable stepwise linear regression analysis showed that grade, environmental adaptation level, number of good friends were independently associated with lower SCL-90 scores (both P < .05). SCL-90 scores were correlated with Chinese Perceived Stress Scale (r = .159, P = .003). Results indicate that learning about ways to adapt to the environment, strengthening good friends support and alleviating perceived stress can help improve graduate nursing students’ level of mental health. The conclusions of this study can provide a reference to improve the psychological intervention strategies for graduate nursing students.","Li, Xing; Song, Wen; Zhang, Jia-Yi; Lu, Chang; Wang, Ya-Xi; Zheng, Yan-Xue; Hao, Wen-Nv",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7837850/,447

Whether this ratio is associated with respiratory disease severity within children presenting to a pediatric emergency department is not known. METHODS: We studied a convenience sample of 63 children presenting to a pediatric emergency department with respiratory symptoms. T cell subsets in the nasal mucosa were analyzed by flow cytometry. We compared CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells subsets in these samples and analyzed the proportion of these subsets that expressed markers associated with tissue residency. RESULTS: We were able to identify major subsets of CD8 and CD4 T cells within the nasal mucosa using flocked swabs. We found no difference in the ratio CD8(+) to CD4(+) T cells in children with upper or lower respiratory illness. A positive association between tissue-resident memory T cell frequency and patient age was identified. CONCLUSIONS: In our patient populations, the CD8(+):CD4(+) ratio was not associated with disease severity. The majority of T cells collected on nasal swabs are antigen experienced, and there is an association between the frequency of tissue-resident T cells and age. IMPACT: Immune cell populations from the nasal mucosa can be captured using flocked nasal swabs and analyzed by flow cytometry. Nasal CD8(+):CD4(+) ratio does not predict respiratory illness severity in children presenting to the emergency department. The frequency of CD8(+) and CD4(+) resident memory T cells within the nasal mucosa increases with age.","Cosgrove, Peter R.; Redhu, Naresh S.; Tang, Ying; Monuteaux, Michael C.; Horwitz, Bruce H.",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7838854/,447

Such an application is the additive manufacturing of electrical components in automotive engineering. In particular, heating units are currently manufactured by a combination of various spray technologies. At present, simpler spraying processes like flame spraying are investigated with regard to their suitability as a future cost-effective alternative for fabricating isolating alumina coatings. In the present study, alumina cords were flame-sprayed using compressed air and argon as atomizing gases. The results demonstrate finely dispersed microstructures and a more regular and partially even higher surface and volume resistivity compared to past investigations in the literature as well as conventionally plasma-sprayed coatings despite a significantly reduced coating thickness. The content of alpha phase is clearly higher than for plasma-sprayed coatings, regardless of the atomizing gas used. Moreover, flame-sprayed coatings using argon reveal a higher resistivity in comparison to coatings sprayed with air. While the atomizing gas is found to mainly influence the ideal stand-off distance, the phase composition is not changed severely. In addition to the phase composition and kinematics, it can finally be concluded that humidity plays a major role in the coating properties.","Hauer, Michél; Meyer, Melanie; Billieres, Dominique; Bricquet, Cédric; Gerstgrasser, Franz; Kiilakoski, Jarkko; Lejay, Julien; Henkel, Knuth-Michael",J Therm Spray Tech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7864139/,447

Predicted seasonal variations of pressure and surface and atmospheric temperature generally agree. Minimum and maximum pressure is predicted at [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] , respectively. Maximum and minimum surface and atmospheric temperature are predicted at [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] , respectively; i.e., are warmest at northern fall equinox not summer solstice. Daily pressure cycles vary more between simulations, possibly due to differences in atmospheric dust distributions. Jezero crater sits inside and close to the NW rim of the huge Isidis basin, whose daytime upslope (∼east-southeasterly) and nighttime downslope (∼northwesterly) winds are predicted to dominate except around summer solstice, when the global circulation produces more southerly wind directions. Wind predictions vary hugely, with annual maximum speeds varying from 11 to [Formula: see text] and daily mean wind speeds peaking in the first half of summer for most simulations but in the second half of the year for two. Most simulations predict net annual sand transport toward the WNW, which is generally consistent with aeolian observations, and peak sand fluxes in the first half of summer, with the weakest fluxes around winter solstice due to opposition between the global circulation and daytime upslope winds. However, one simulation predicts transport toward the NW, while another predicts fluxes peaking later and transport toward the WSW. Vortex activity is predicted to peak in summer and dip around winter solstice, and to be greater than at InSight and much greater than in Gale crater.

Devices capable of both recording and manipulating neuronal activity brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) should ideally operate un-tethered and allow chronic longitudinal manipulations in the freely moving animal. In this study, we designed a new intracortical BCI feasible of telemetric recording and stimulating local gray and white matter of visual neural circuit after irradiation exposure. To increase the translational reliance, we put forward a Göttingen minipig model. The animal was stereotactically irradiated at the level of the visual cortex upon defining the target by a fused cerebral MRI and CT scan. A fully implantable neural telemetry system consisting of a 64 channel intracortical multielectrode array, a telemetry capsule, and an inductive rechargeable battery was then implanted into the visual cortex to record and manipulate local field potentials, and multi-unit activity. We achieved a 3-month stability of the functionality of the un-tethered BCI in terms of telemetric radio-communication, inductive battery charging, and device biocompatibility for 3 months. Finally, we could reliably record the local signature of sub- and suprathreshold neuronal activity in the visual cortex with high bandwidth without complications. The ability to wireless induction charging combined with the entirely implantable design, the rather high recording bandwidth, and the ability to record and stimulate simultaneously put forward a wireless BCI capable of long-term un-tethered real-time communication for causal preclinical circuit-based closed-loop interventions.","Zaer, Hamed; Deshmukh, Ashlesha; Orlowski, Dariusz; Fan, Wei; Prouvot, Pierre-Hugues; Glud, Andreas Nørgaard; Jensen, Morten Bjørn; Worm, Esben Schjødt; Lukacova, Slávka; Mikkelsen, Trine Werenberg; Fitting, Lise Moberg; Adler, John R.; Schneider, M.

Although CIs security management process is well analyzed in the literature there is a need to set a common ground among different CIs, thus reducing administration/coordination overhead and rendering the decision making and crisis management process more efficient. In this direction, this paper considers three different CIs (airport facilities, gas infrastructures, and hospitals); presents the current and emerging physical and cyber security related regulations and standards, operations, organisational and technical measure and; finally, through the discussion on gaps and best practices identified, proposes a global, cyber-physical security management and joint coordination approach.

Compared to conventional methods of fractionation and recovery of saccharides, nanofiltration (NF) has received considerable attention in recent decades because of its high selectivity and low energy consumption and environmental impact. In this review the advantages and challenges of NF based technology in the separation of saccharides are critically evaluated. Hybrid membrane processes, i.e., combining NF with ultrafiltration, can complement each other to provide an efficient approach for removal of unwanted solutes to obtain higher purity saccharides. However, use of NF membrane separation technology is limited due to irreversible membrane fouling that results in high capital and operating costs. Future development of NF membrane technology should therefore focus on improving material stability, antifouling ability and saccharide targeting selectivity, as well as on engineering aspects such as process optimisation and membrane module design.

47755,Postagiler Denk- und Handlungsraum,2020-08-13,"At their course’s final years, both undergraduate and postgraduate design students are often presented with a pool of topics that they can select from to work on their major/final project. Some students struggle first with making this choice, and then, after the work is submitted, marked and the degree is completed, they have to deal with the frustration of leaving such projects behind and totally inconsequential. This may happen because the student is not oriented towards reflecting on how each of the possible topics to choose from can become a more or less impactful project 1) during the remainder of their studies, 2) for their professional development and future employability, and 3) in terms of supporting/helping a wider community, by solving a problem common to many. After analysing 35 generative boards/canvases retrieved from a diversity of professional sources, a taxonomy for the design of this kind of visual tools was optimised and a visual board—the Impact Plan—is proposed. It aims at obviating the lack of reflection on the moment of choosing a project, providing students with a matching process between their interpretation of the available or most interesting projects from said pool, and their motivations, capacities, ambitions, levels of altruism and perception of value. A low-fidelity prototype was designed and tested with academics and careers/placements officers. The tool triggered immediate interest, for which reason it is currently being implemented as alternative assessment (due to the recent COVID-19 disruptions) in a postgraduate academic context.","Lelis, Catarina","Advances in Design, Music and Arts",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972459/,447

Among the several classification approaches, the index-based method has been recognized as the best one to gather LU/LC information from different images sources. The present work is intended to assess its performance exploiting the great potentialities of Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-processing environment introduced by Google to storage and handle a large number of information. Twelve atmospherically corrected Landsat satellite images were collected on the experimental site of Siponto, in Southern Italy. Once the clouds masking procedure was completed, a large number of indices were implemented and compared in GEE platform to detect sparse and dense vegetation, water, bare soils and built-up areas. Among the tested algorithms, only NDBaI2, CVI, WI2015, SwiRed and STRed indices showed satisfying performance. Although NDBaI2 was able to extract all the main LU/LC categories with a high Overall Accuracy (OA) (82.59%), the other mentioned indices presented a higher accuracy than the first one but are able to identify just few classes. An interesting performance is shown by the STRed index since it has a very high OA and can extract mining areas, water and green zones.

51040,KnorpelRegister - Bilanz nach sieben Jahren,2021-04-13,"INTRODUCTION: Prolonged bedrest amongst the elderly causes deconditioning leading to; increased hospital length of stay, additional social costs and decreased quality of life. An audit on an acute geriatric ward in November 2018, found that over a third of patients medically fit (PMF) to sit out remained in bed all day. Therefore, a service development initiative was undertaken, addressing the misconception that keeping elderly patients in bed is safe, when in fact, unintentional harm results. METHOD: In a root cause analysis, four main reasons for bedrest were identified: risk aversion, unknown function, widespread “bed is safe” culture and lack of equipment. The project tasked getting PMF out of bed each day and was audited daily from November 2018 to present, involving all members of the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) and using a “plan, do, study, act” approach. RESULTS: Initially, the project showed an increase in percentage of PMF sitting out each day, but this subsequently decreased with winter pressures. However, for a whole year (February 2019–February 2020) a sustained and significant improvement was achieved (64.3%–89.7%). The pre-COVID19 period (February–March 2020) saw fluctuations in PMF sitting out. Data collection halted during the COVID19 peak, although observationally most patients remained in bed. Auditing resumed from June 2020 (COVID19 recovery phase) which showed a steady increase in PMF out of bed, with recent figures surpassing pre-COVID19 levels (97.8%). CONCLUSION: Cultural change takes time to embed and needs persistent reviewing by a dedicated and engaged MDT. Improvements were made through more accessible doctor’s advice, better MDT education and communication, daily feedback of data and sourcing additional equipment. Disruption to working patterns over the COVID19 period made this unachievable and the project lost impetus. In the COVID19 recovery phase, the specialized MDT reformed and worked successfully to restore the cultural change as evidenced by audited data.","Butler, J; Welford, T",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989623/,447

NICE guidance recommended using frailty scoring to support decision making around escalation of care. This study aimed to assess frailty, demographics and COVID-19 infection and to investigate how these related to outcomes of patients aged over 65 years admitted to hospital. METHODS: A single centre retrospective cohort study was carried out by reviewing the electronic health records of all admissions over 65 years. Data points collected included length of stay (LOS), frailty score using the Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and mortality. Patients were stratified into COVID and non-COVID based on health records and into non-frail (CFS 1–4) and frail (CFS 5–9). RESULTS: A total of 257 patients admitted between 30th March and 30th April 2020 were included in the study (mean age 79 years, 43% female). 141 (54.9%) of patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. 120 patients had CFS 1–4 and 136 has CFS 5–9. 1 patient did not have a frailty score due to insufficient information. 68 (26.8%) of all patients died during the admission. The relative risk (RR) of mortality of patients with coronavirus was 6.3 (95% CI 3.1–12.6, p < 0.0001). The RR of mortality for frail patients compared to the non-frail was 2.1 (95% CI 1.3–3.2, p = 0.002). The median LOS for patients with COVID-19 was 5 days, compared to 4 days for patients who did not have coronavirus. Frailty did not predict longer admission, with median LOS of 5 days for both non-frail and frail patients. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated in this study show that COVID-19 infection and frailty were significantly associated with increased mortality in older patients. This validates the continued use of frailty scoring of older patients on admission to support care planning.","Okuwoga, O; Mufti, S",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989626/,447

It is unknown if such discussions can be effectively delivered online by palliative care specialists to support care home (CH) staff in relation to death/dying. Funded by Scotland’s Chief Scientist Office COVID-19 “rapid research” fund, online OSCaRS is being piloted. METHODS: Fortnightly OSCaRS delivered to small groups of CH staff via a secure online platform in three local CHs over 10 weeks. Sessions are digitally recorded. The shortened version of the Chesney coping self-efficacy questionnaire is completed by all staff pre/post. Additional post-study questions asked of OSCaRS participants and in-depth staff interviews will be undertaken (n = 10). Thematic analysis of the recorded sessions and interviews will be undertaken and related to the staff questionnaire and context of each CH. RESULTS: New learning on the feasibility and acceptability of providing OSCaRS to frontline staff. The benefit of OSCaRS to CH staff coping mechanisms, team cohesion and communicaton with relatives during the COVID-19 pandemic will be presented. Initial results show that OSCaRS are feasible, valued by all care home staff and support staff in coping with the challenges of COVID-19/. KEY CONCLUSIONS: The analysis will inform future practice, and an Implementation Guide for OSCaRS in CHs will be produced. Key learning on the potential for online support in relation to death/dying during the pandemic and beyond will contribute to future education, training and staff wellbeing resources. It will also inform the role of such sessions in developing individual coping mechanisms and team working alongside communication with relatives during lockdown.","Hockley, J; Johnston, L; Watson, J; Shenkin, S D",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989628/,447
51046,Freihalte-Pauschalen sollen es retten : Über Krankenhausfinanzierung und variable Vergütung,2021-04-13,"INTRODUCTION: In response to the Covid19 pandemic a community Hospital was transformed in to a Community Frailty Unit (CFU). The aims were to meet the needs of patients living with frailty including medical instability and end of life care outside the acute setting, to improve patient flow and to improve integration of acute and community frailty services. METHOD: Existing community teams were integrated with an acute based multidisciplinary team including a frailty practitioner and pharmacist. Supported by programme managers they rapidly transformed (within 3 weeks) processes to align these with the acute site including paperwork, assessments, use of a flow board, board rounds and discharge to assess. Technology was used to organise transfers via the NHS Digital approved App Pando. Point of care testing and oxygen concentrators were put in place. RESULTS: Median and mean length of stay (LOS) in the acute site reduced by 59% (14.5 to 6 days) and 56% (18 to 8 days) respectively. Median and mean LOS in the community site reduced by 38% (16 to 10 days) and 39% (18 to 11 days) respectively. Readmissions fell from 10% to 2%. 85% of staff rated the following better or much better: the capability of the service to manage every aspect of the patient’s care; integration; co-ordination of transfers. 83% of staff rated patient experience better or much better and 79% rated discharge co-ordination better or much better. At 85% bed occupancy at a cost of £67 k/bed/year this released 5,525 bed days and 16.9 beds with a return on investment of £1,132,300. CONCLUSION: It is possible to rapidly integrate community and acute services and to establish acute frailty unit care in a community setting. A CFU can lead to improved integration, patient flow, patient and staff experience at reduced system wide cost.","Wilson, H",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989640/,447

Older adults were disproportionally affected by routine care disruption. To our knowledge, no data has been published so far on the impact of service disruption on 30-day readmission. METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study of all patients admitted to a single east London hospital with laboratory-confirmed or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 between 16th March and 6th April 2020. Older patients were defined as aged 80 years and over. Readmission was captured within 30 days of discharge. Comparator defined as the same period in 2019. Descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety-three patients were included. The majority survived to discharge (69.7%). Positive laboratory testing was similar between older and younger patients (85.7% vs 84.7%, p = NS). Mortality was significantly higher for older patients on index presentation (60.2% vs 20.3%, p < 0.001). Length of stay was also significantly longer for these patients (median 9 vs 7 days, p = 0.00694). The readmission rate for the 274 individuals discharged after index admission was 11.3% (n = 31). Amongst older patients, readmission rate during the study period was slightly higher than the same period in 2019 (17.9% vs 14.8%, p = 0.36). The median time interval between discharge and re-attendance was 8 [1–29]days. All re-attending older patients were re-admitted, whereas 54.2% of younger patients were sent home directly from the emergency department. Only 1 of the 31 patients re-attended because of insufficient social care. CONCLUSIONS: Our data shows that readmission rates in the older population of East London during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic were largely similar to non-pandemic periods. During this period, readmission rates appear to have been driven by clinical rather than social imperatives. This suggests that adapted social care services performed well and should be reinforced for future surges.","Mooney, C J; Hone, L; Majid, M; Cai, J; Mieiro, L; Fink, D L",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989645/,447

Throughout this difficult period, a spirit of collaboration and peer support have been crucial in helping to maintain urgent care access for patients and in assisting practices with their return to full operational activity. Dental clusters can provide a different model of working, and can provide improved access to dental care for patients as well as reducing inequalities. They can also improve collaboration and communication between primary care dental services. Furthermore, clusters can help to provide a support network for clinicians and facilitate better integration with medical colleagues. Dental clusters may also provide a better platform for innovation to meet the demands of local populations. Importantly, we feel that clustering can bring educational benefits to colleagues, as it can encourage a multi-disciplinary teamwork approach to patient care and to the needs of the local population, through regular cluster meetings. This can benefit colleagues through peer review, case-based discussions, mentoring and upskilling within clusters.

51642,Die Lungenfunktion im Fokus,2021-04-16,"BACKGROUND: As society ages, promoting the health of the extra years of life is of paramount importance for health, social care and pension provision. Increases in life expectancy in the UK and elsewhere have slowed in recent years, but the reasons for this are unclear. No formal comparison of trends in healthy life years between the UK and the other countries of the EU28 in recent times has been published. These countries are geographically proximate, and share many social, cultural and demographic properties, making them interesting and useful comparators, especially as the UK prepared to leave the European Union in 2020. METHODS: We calculated sex-specific healthy life years (HLY), unhealthy life years (ULY), mild and severe ULY at birth and age 65 using life tables and age-specific prevalence of activity limitation amongst the EU28 between 2008 and 2016 from EuroHex. Trends in life expectancy, HLY, ULY and proportion of life spent healthy (HLY%) were compared. We then decomposed HLY temporal changes into relative effects of changes in healthy life and mortality, by age group. FINDINGS: Life expectancy at birth, and age 65, in the UK were increasing rapidly in 2008 but slowed around 2011. Germany, Portugal and France showed evidence of a similar slowing. HLY at birth in the UK decreased, whereas it increased in most EU28 countries. The UK experienced a period of absolute expansion of unhealthy life in both sexes. The reduction in HLY at birth in the UK was mainly attributable to increases in unhealthy life in younger age groups. INTERPRETATION: The UK's performance relative to the other countries of the EU28 was poor after 2011, combining static life expectancy and reductions in healthy life years. These trends suggest that the UK government's Ageing Society Grand Challenge (to increase the healthy life expectancy by five years by 2035) will be difficult to attain.

The paper presents findings from a questionnaire survey (n = 530) administered to English secondary school students (age 15–16) in which their beliefs and concepts regarding personhood and the position of science were investigated. The survey was motivated in part by an interview study and a previous, smaller survey which revealed that many students struggle to reconcile their beliefs with what they suppose science to say and also that some have reluctantly dismissed the soul as a ‘nice story’ which is incompatible with scientific facts. The results from this larger-scale survey indicate that a majority of the students believe in some form of soul. Even so, and regardless of whether or not they identified themselves as religious, most students expressed a belief that human persons cannot be fully explained scientifically, a position that some students perceived as a partial rejection of what it means to hold a scientific worldview.","Billingsley, Berry; Nassaji, Mehdi",Sci Educ (Dordr),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8043432/,447

Answers to this assessment are influenced by social, cultural and personality factors. Aim: Exploring common and distinctive characteristics of Brazilian and Portuguese older adults aged 70 and over regarding positive self-rated health according to sociodemographic variables, to functional capacity, to independent performance of basic activities of daily living and to neuroticism, as well as analyzing associations between positive self-rated health and these variables. Methods: The present paper is a comparative and cross-sectional study based on secondary data contained in the databases of the FIBRA (Frailty in Brazilian Older Adults) follow-up study, with 418 Brazilian older adults, and of the DIA (From Disability to Activity: The Challenge of Aging) study, with 380 Portuguese older adults. Both samples had higher percentages of women: 68.4% for Portugal and 69.9% for Brazil. The Brazilian sample had a higher average age (80.31 ± 4.67) than the Portuguese sample (76.80 ± 5.28). Results: The Portuguese older adults had better overall cognition scores, higher handgrip strength and higher neuroticism values than the Brazilian older adults. In the simple and multiple logistic regression analyses, it was found that among Brazilian older adults, subjects with higher scores in the MMSE (OR 1.16; 95% CI 1.08–1.24), regardless of ADL performance (OR 2.13; 95% CI 1.31–3.47) and with scores 24–29 (OR 1.92; 95% CI 1.07–3.43) or 11–23 (OR 2.09; 95% CI 1.15–3.79) in neuroticism were more likely to assess their health as very good/good. On the other hand, the Portuguese older adults with intermediate 24–9 (OR 2.38; 95% CI 1.31–4.33) or low 11–23 (OR 5.31; 95% CI 2.69–10.45) scores in neuroticism were more likely to evaluate their health as very good/good. Conclusion: Based on the findings of the present study and on the existing literature, it may be said that it is possible for people to age while keeping a positive perception of their own health, even in advanced old age; comparisons between the above-mentioned countries, however, point to the need for investments in healthcare systems so that older adults may enjoy greater physical independence and improved mental health.","Cachioni, Meire; Cipolli, Gabriela Cabett; Borim, Flávia Silva Arbex; Batistoni, Samila Sathler Tavares; Yassuda, Mônica Sanches; Neri, Anita Liberalesso; Paúl, Constança",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8044971/,447

52483,FSME: Rekordjahr der Infektionen,2021-05-21,"Background: A Case of Hypocalcemia Secondary to Infection with SARS-CoV-2 Virus. Clinical Case: A 40 year-old obese male presented to the emergency department with a five day history of nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, and nonproductive cough. Symptoms progressed culminating in a single episode of pre-syncope leading to his seeking medical care. Positive testing for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 as well as findings from computed tomography of the patient’s chest led to a diagnosis of COVID-19 and the patient’s admission to a COVID-19 ward, where treatment with dexamethasone, doxycycline, and 2 L oxygen via nasal cannula began. Blood testing on admission revealed profound hypocalcemia (6.2 mg/dL total and 3.5 mg/dL ionized) as well as newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) (HbA1c 13.0% on admission). Further electrolyte disturbances noted were consistent with his history of vomiting and untreated T2DM. Thyroid stimulating hormone and thyroxine levels showed primary hypothyroidism, but the patient’s parathyroid hormone level (16.5 pg/mL) was inappropriately normal. No other causes for hypocalcemia were identified. The patient’s hypocalcemia was treated with intravenous calcium gluconate and rose consistently through day six of hospitalization. Calcium fell sharply between day six and seven (7.6 mg/dL to 7.3 mg/dL) coinciding with worsening respiratory symptoms and requiring a doubling of oxygen dose from 2 to 4 L with subsequent improvement in hypocalcemia once underlying pulmonary function improved. Discussion: SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting with hypocalcemia has been well documented without definitive explanation [1]. Further, while the precise mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 virion export is unclear, the patient’s worsening hypocalcemia, respiratory symptoms, and concurrent presumable increased viral load suggests this is caused by a calcium-dependent exocytotic process [2]. 1: Marazuela, M., Giustina, A. & Puig-Domingo, M.

52484,Fehler als Chance,2021-05-17,"Background: In Spring 2020 the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic disease (Covid-19) badly affected Northern Italy. We have described for the first time the occurrence of thyrotoxicosis due to atypical subacute thyroiditis in 15% of patients hospitalised for Covid-19 pneumonia, compared with only 1% among patients hospitalised in the same wards during Spring 2019, thus before the Covid-19 pandemic. The whole group of Covid-19 patients also had median serum TSH concentrations significantly lower compared with the control group. The atypical thyroiditis induced by Covid-19 is not associated with neck pain, affects more men than women and especially those severely ill, thus coexists with non-thyroidal illness syndrome. Subacute thyroiditis is classically followed by subsequent occurrence of permanent thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity, thus we have started a systematic follow-up program of these patients. Methods: Longitudinal follow-up study of survived Covid-19 patients without previous known history of thyroid disorders and/or medications, assessing serum thyroid function and autoantibodies, C reactive protein (CRP), full blood count (FBC) and thyroid ultrasound (US) every 3 months. Patients showing baseline (at hospitalisation for Covid-19) thyroid dysfunction and/or focal hypoechoic areas suggestive for subacute thyroiditis at US performed 3 months post-infection, also underwent thyroid (99m)Tc or I(123)uptake. Results: To date, 53 patients have been included in the follow-up study. At 3 months post-infection, all of them presented with increased median (IQR) serum TSH concentrations compared with baseline: 1.3 (0.9–2.0) mIU/L versus 0.9 (0.5–1.8) mIU/L (p=0.0001). Similarly, serum concentrations of free-thyroxine, free-triiodothyronine, CRP and FBC had normalised compared with baseline. All patients had negative autoantibodies to TSH receptor; autoantibodies to thyroglobulin and to thyroid peroxidase were positive in 6/53 (11%) and 5/53 (9%) of patients, respectively. The thyroid US showed the presence of focal hypoechoic areas of thyroiditis in 16/51 (32%) patients, with thyroid uptake normal in 6/16 (37%), focally reduced in 8/16 (50%) and diffusely reduced in 2/16 (12%). Conclusions: At 3 months after Covid-19 disease all patients had a normalised thyroid function, however imaging findings suggestive for subacute thyroiditis were still present in about one third of cases. The thyroid dysfunction induced by Covid-19 seems not mediated by autoimmunity. It is important to continue to follow these patients since they might develop thyroid dysfunction during the following months.","Muller, Ilaria; Cannavaro, Daniele; Dazzi, Davide; Mantovani, Giovanna; Longari, Virgilio; Cuzzocrea, Marco; Re, Tiziana E; Gori, Andrea; Arosio, Maura; Salvi, Mario Giovanni",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089342/,447

Hypokalemia is an important electrolyte abnormality associated with infection due to SARS-CoV-2 as it may be associated with life threatening cardiac abnormalities Objective: To investigate the prevalence and clinical implications of of hypokalemia and its association with disease severity and various laboratory markers of inflammation. Materials and methods-design, setting and participants: This retrospective study was conducted at Peerless Hospital, Kolkata, West Bengal, India, from March 15, 2020, to September 30, 2020. Participants included patients who received a diagnosis of COVID-19 after testing positive by RT-PCR test and were admitted to the hospital. The patients were classified as having severe hypokalemia (plasma potassium <3 mmol/L), hypokalemia (plasma potassium 3-3.5 mmol/L), and normokalemia (plasma potassium >3.5 mmol/L). We categorized patients into 3 groups of disease severity- mild (fever/uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infection without hypoxemia), moderate (pneumonia with no signs of severe disease, respiratory rate > 24/min OR spO2 <94% in room air) and severe (respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation- NIV or invasive, respiratory rate > 30/min Or SpO2 <90% in room air). The clinical features, lab and ECG abnormalities, were compared between the 3 groups. Data analysis was conducted in October 2020. Interventions: The patients were given general support and antiviral therapy. Their epidemiological and clinical features were collected. Results: 122 patients(38.4%) had hypokalemia and 58 patients(18.2%) had severe hypokalemia. There was significant association between disease severity and hypokalemia. Fever had significant association with hypokalemia and severe hypokalemia. There was also significant association between dyspnea, anosmia, decreased oxygen saturation, ECG abnormalities and mortality with hypokalemic patients. Also there was significant association between degree of hypokalemia and markers of systemic inflammation such as IL-6 and CRP. Conclusions: The high prevalence of hypokalemia among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 suggests the presence of disordered rennin angiotensin system activity, which is increased as a result of the reduced counteractivity of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, which is bound by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. The study also indicates the need to monitor this group of patients for cardiac rhythm disturbances, especially when drugs like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, which are known to prolong the QTc interval and are known to reduce the rate of cardiac conduction and cause arrythmias, are used off-label to treat COVID-19.","Bhatnagar, Mohit",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089881/,447

METHODS: Medical records were reviewed from March–September 2020 (study group). The study period was divided into three intervals guided by the number of confirmed cases with COVID-19 and the measures taken during the lockdowns in the corresponding periods. Case burden, dilatation sessions, dysphagia score, and further interventions were reviewed. Case burden and dilatation sessions were compared to equivalent periods in 2019 (control group). RESULTS: The study group included 13 patients that had 19 dilatation sessions in contrast to 29 patients that had 98 sessions in the comparative group. In the study group, eight cases experienced deterioration in their dysphagia score, while further interventions were performed on four of them.

Should we take measures to protect elderly people or people suffering from co-morbidities? Many applications and approaches have been proposed to ensure public safety in the context of COVID-19. In this chapter, we will start by making an inventory of these applications, discuss strategies and technologies adopted, and categorize them. Thereafter we will present an approach consisting in calculating a vulnerability score to propose a solution for protecting people at risk. Then, we will detail the architecture of “uTakeCare,” an open-source application that we have implemented, as well as the method used to calculate the vulnerability score.

Serial chest radiographic changes in MERS-Cov patients were analyzed for various variables that could be compared to the patients’ final outcomes in a cluster of MERS-Cov patients and to identify a predictor of mortality in the United Arab Emirates. RESULTS: A total of 44 MERS-Cov cases were reviewed. The mean age of the patients was 43.7 ± 14.7 years. The chest radiograph was abnormal in 14/44 (31.8%). The commonest radiology features include ground-glass opacities (seven of 14, 50%), ground-glass and consolidation (seven of 14, 50%), pleural effusion (eight of 14, 57.1%), and air bronchogram (three of 14, 21.4%). The mortality rate was 13.6% (six of 44); the deceased group (6 of 44, 13.6%) was associated with significantly higher incidence of mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001), pleural effusion (p < 0.001), chest radiographic score (8.90 ± 6.31, p < 0.001), and type 4 radiographic progression of disease (p < 0.001). A chest radiographic score at presentation was seen to be an independent and strong predictor of mortality (OR [95% confidence interval] 3.20 [1.35, 7.61]). The Cohen κ coefficient for the interobserver agreement was k = 0.89 (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The chest radiographic score, associated with a higher degree of disease progression (type 4), particularly in patients with old age or with comorbidity, may indicate a poorer prognosis in MERS-Cov infection, necessitating intensive care unit management or predicting impending death.","Das, Karuna M.; Alkoteesh, Jamal Aldeen; Sheek-Hussein, Mohamud; Alzadjali, Samira Ali; Alafeefi, Mariam Tareq; Singh, Rajvir; Statsenko, Yauhen; Soteriades, Elpidoforos S.; Singh, Vishwajeet; Van Gorkom, Klaus",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8146173/,447

A statistically and mathematically literate society is crucial for ensuring that citizens are able to sift through political rhetoric to maintain life-saving procedures such as social distancing and other infection dampening efforts. Additionally, recent civil unrest due to the disproportionate killings of Black men by police provokes investigation into the public’s mathematical literacy. In this paper, we investigate adolescent students’ critical mathematics consciousness and mathematics literacy as they reason through two interview tasks on the coronavirus and police shooting data. Drawing on Frankenstein’s program of Critical Mathematics Education, we introduce an analytic framework for documenting the critical mathematics consciousness of adolescent students. We interviewed fifteen 14- to 16-year-old students as they solved five tasks designed to elicit their critical and ethical mathematical awareness. Our findings indicate that students exhibit very little critical mathematics consciousness in the context of the police problem but show awareness that data can be presented in ways that manipulate the public’s emotions in the coronavirus problem.

Wistar rats were pretreated intragastrically with vehicle, BW-HS-101 (0.5–50 μmol/kg) or its analogue without the ability to release H(2)S, BW-iHS-101 prior to ASA administration (125 mg/kg, intragastrically). BW-HS-101 was administered alone or in combination with nitroarginine (L-NNA, 20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) or zinc protoporphyrin IX (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally). Gastroprotective effects of BW-HS-101 were additionally evaluated against necrotic damage induced by intragastrical administration of 75% ethanol. Gastric mucosal damage was assessed microscopically, and gastric blood flow was determined by laser flowmetry. Gastric mucosal DNA oxidation and PGE(2) concentration were assessed by ELISA. Serum and/or gastric protein concentrations of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, VEGF, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and EGF were determined by a microbeads/fluorescent-based multiplex assay. Changes in gastric mucosal iNOS, HMOX-1, SOCS3, IL1-R1, IL1-R2, TNF-R2, COX-1, and COX-2 mRNA were assessed by real-time PCR. BW-HS-101 or BW-iHS-101 applied at a dose of 50 μmol/kg protected gastric mucosa against ASA-induced gastric damage and prevented a decrease in the gastric blood flow level. H(2)S prodrug decreased DNA oxidation, systemic and gastric mucosal inflammation with accompanied upregulation of SOCS3, and EGF and HMOX-1 expression. Pharmacological inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthase but not carbon monoxide (CO)/heme oxygenase (HMOX) activity by L-NNA or ZnPP, respectively, reversed the gastroprotective effect of BW-HS-101. BW-HS-101 also protected against ethanol-induced gastric injury formation. We conclude that BW-HS-101, due to its ability to release H(2)S in a controllable manner, prevents gastric mucosa against drugs-induced gastropathy, inflammation and DNA oxidation, and upregulate gastric microcirculation. Gastroprotective effects of this H(2)S prodrug involves endogenous NO but not CO activity and could be mediated by cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory SOCS3 and EGF pathways.","Bakalarz, Dominik; Korbut, Edyta; Yuan, Zhengnan; Yu, Bingchen; Wójcik, Dagmara; Danielak, Aleksandra; Magierowska, Katarzyna; Kwiecień, Slawomir; Brzozowski, Tomasz; Marcinkowska, Monika; Wang, Binghe; Magierowski, Marcin",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8155842/,447

PD is both a public health and social problem facing the government and society as a whole. Persons with PD need reasonable medication management and rehabilitation strategies after a clear diagnosis. A proper home care plan can effectively slow the progression of PD. However, people with PD lack an effective way to manage their illnesses and cannot achieve the recommended clinical path in a family environment. Medication management, condition monitoring, and rehabilitation training are important components of the home care plan for PD. Persons with PD require strategies that delay the development of the disease and to adhere to treatment, which would contribute to improving their quality of life. Thus, we developed a small program called Care-PD to build a medicine management and service platform for PD. The development of Care-PD is a multi-dimensional model designed for PD, which is funded by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2018YFC1314700), and includes services such as medication management, symptom monitoring, professional counseling, home life, and community communication. Care-PD can become a key technology that increases the compliance of persons with PD with home care plans and improve measures to control the disease. In this article, we describe the medication management and services for PD based on the Care-PD program and its structure.

In Alberta there is a huge delivery gap in providing healthcare services for children with TS and OCD. A stakeholder consultation was performed to ascertain how service delivery could be improved across the province and to inform the development of a provincial information and support organization, the Tourette OCD Alberta Network. METHODS: A mixed-methods study was employed: 10 parents were recruited for interview and 140 parents responded to a survey. RESULTS: Qualitative data showed there was often an absence of a clear pathway to access healthcare for people with TS and OCD. The negative impact of not receiving treatment, information, and resources in a timely and prompt manner was also revealed. Good clinical practice existed across the province but too often it was hindered by a shortage of knowledge about TS and OCD. In schools, learning for students with TS and OCD was also impaired by educators’ lack of knowledge and preparedness in relation to the disorders. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified ways that challenges with healthcare access, school learning, and seeking information can be overcome. Skills-based training webinars, educational outreach in schools, and peer support were recognized as actions for improving healthcare outcomes for people with TS and OCD. The aim of the Tourette OCD Alberta Network is to provide services and support that directly address the healthcare service delivery shortfalls shown in this study.

55279,"Vielfalt, Qualität und Perspektiven der Psychotherapieforschung",2021-07-01,"Flipped teaching (FT) has gained attention due to its method of teaching that allows students to learn basic concepts on their own using instructor‐provided resources before their scheduled class time. The class time is used in rehearsing and applying the knowledge using active learning approaches. The COVID‐19 pandemic caused an unexpected shift from face‐to‐face to remote learning during the middle of the spring 2020 semester challenging both students and faculty. This study examined the transition of students from the flipped classroom method to rapid online learning and whether the transition was dependent on the faculty experience with FT. The perception of the transition of students in the classrooms of faculty (n=12) with extensive experience in FT (cohort 1) was compared with that of a second cohort (n=11) who were in their first semester of FT implementation. Both qualitative and quantitative survey data were collected from 23 classrooms (n=256 students). It was found that the students in the courses taught by cohort 1 who had received intensive FT training and implemented FT in semesters prior to the COVID‐19 pandemic were able to facilitate a smoother transition and adjustment to fully online learning for their students compared to the students in the courses taught by cohort 2 (p< 0.01). The qualitative data analysis suggested that the students participating in the FT courses in the first half of the semester, before the pandemic, had an easier transition to fully online learning. Students also expressed concerns that online learning was affected by the lack of interaction with faculty and peers, lack of motivation, issues with time management, and personal and technological demands. In conclusion, this study found that faculty experience with FT helped ease the transition of students from the face‐to‐face FT to the online format during the COVID‐19 pandemic.","Gopalan, Chaya; Onal, Sinan; Butts‐Wilmsmeyer, Carolyn; Dickey, Paige; Serrano, Charles; Bracey, Georgia; Bartels, Lynn; Locke, Sharon; Fickas, Julie",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239837/,447

55553,Künstliche Intelligenz (KI),2021-07-07,"Brewin (2020) was optimistic about the fate of the Canadian grains and oilseeds sector in 2020 as the COVID‐19 pandemic descended on the world. The sector did generate a large crop and, towards the end of 2020, saw a lift in prices. This contributed to record farm income in Canada in 2020. The pace of grain and oilseed exports in Canada and ethanol demand in the east were affected by COVID‐19, but the forecast of a “near normal” 2020 was relatively accurate. Production and prices stayed on track, largely because the world did not impose significant new barriers to trade in cereals and oilseeds and because these sectors have distanced labor in virtually every step of the supply chain which protected these markets from this pandemic. The dominant price factor for the sector remains global demand that had been growing before 2020 relative to the pace of production and may have been stimulated by deficit budgets around the world. Compared to the tight global stocks, COVID‐19 had a minor impact on grain prices which led to steady production worldwide and in Canada. We are still waiting for more evidence to assess the role of federal coordination in the success of the grains and oilseed sector in 2020, but Canada's past participation in trade and safety protocols based on science allowed the grains and oilseed sector in Canada to earn a very good income in 2020.","Brewin, Derek Gerald",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8251303/,447

More than 80 species of Trichoderma are reported in the literature. However T. asperellum, T. harzianum, T. viride, and T. virens are most commonly utilized as biocontrol agents. Studies were initiated to explore the potential of biocontrol agents in order to develop a cost effective and practical management strategy. Analysis of large number of soil samples collected from western parts of the region led to isolation of native biocontrol agents viz., Trichoderma harzianum, Aspergillus versicolor, and Bacillus firmus from different agricultural systems. These biocontrol agents have proved their antagonistic ability in laboratory tests and field trials. In India, two species of Trichoderma i.e., T. viride and T. harzianum are commercially registered for usage against soil borne plant pathogens mostly as a seed treatment or soil application. There are published scientific papers on the efficacy of T. asperellum and T. virens in India for suppressing pathogens but these are not yet registered under Central Insecticide Board and Registration Committee (CIB & RC).

The rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction data confirms single-phase triclinic crystal structure of Mg(2)B(2)O(5) nanoparticles. The direct band gap determined using diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) was 5.23 eV, which is contrary to earlier reports quoting Mg(2)B(2)O(5) as indirect band gap material. To elucidate the nature of band gap in Mg(2)B(2)O(5), we performed first principle calculations based on full potential linearized augmented plane-wave (FPLAPW) method, predicting the direct band gap of 5.10 eV in t-Mg(2)B(2)O(5) which is in good agreement with our experimental results. The t-Mg(2)B(2)O(5) nanoparticles were found to exhibit yellow-reddish photoluminescence peaking at 588 nm, attributed to various defects states. The combustion synthesized Mg(2)B(2)O(5) nanocrystals exhibited ultraviolet (254 nm) responsive thermoluminescence (TL). TL glow curve of Mg(2)B(2)O(5) comprises of one dominant peak around 417–428 K and less intense shoulder around 573–589 K which arouse possibility of various trapping sites or defects present in the sample. The TL analysis using general order Kitti’s equations was performed to estimate the activation energies of trapping states. Owing to already well-known mechanical and thermal properties, the direct wide band gap nature and UV responsive thermoluminescence of combustion synthesized t-Mg(2)B(2)O(5) nanostructures can pave way for its use in luminescence-based applications and UV dosimetry. As an additional application of Mg(2)B(2)O(5), anti-biofilms activity of Mg(2)B(2)O(5) nanoparticles using pseudomonas aeruginosa bacterial cells was also performed which revealed 91 ± 2.7% inhibition of biofilms formed by P. aeruginosa, respectively, at 100 μg/ml after 24 h of treatment.","Kumar, Jitender; Kumar, Rajesh; Singh, Mukhtiyar; Kumar, Shalendra; Kumar, Ravi; Won, Sung Ok; Brajpuriya, Ranjeet; Dwivedi, Sourabh; Sharma, Ram K.; Vij, Ankush",Appl Phys A Mater Sci Process,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8299454/,447

Camel brucellosis has been reported in almost all camel-rearing countries in Africa and Asia. A cross-sectional study was conducted between February 2020 and February 2021 in Galkayo, Garowe, and Bosaso districts in the Puntland State of Somalia to investigate the seroprevalence and risk factors of brucellosis in camels. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) was used to detect anti-Brucella antibodies, while a structured questionnaire was used to collect epidemiological data. A total of 441 camel sera were screened against Brucella antibodies. Thirty-one (7%; 95% CI: 4.8–9.8%) samples were positive, and thirteen (54.2%; 95% CI: 32.8–74.4%) out of the twenty-four farms sampled had at least one seropositive animal. Galkayo district had the highest number of Brucella-seropositive camels (10.3%), followed by Bosaso district (8.6%), while Garowe district had the lowest number of seropositive camels (1.4%). The binary logistic regression model revealed that camels in Galkayo district (p = 0.015; OR: 9.428; 95% CI: 1.539–57.755), camels from large herd sizes of >50 animals (p = 0.019; OR: 5.822; 95% CI: 1.336–25.371), and those in contact with small ruminants (p = 0.011; OR: 10.941; 95% CI: 1.728–69.285) were significantly associated with seropositive cases of camel brucellosis in the Puntland State of Somalia. The present study shows that Brucella infections in camels are prevalent in the three districts covered by the study. This poses a public health risk, because milk from these camels is used for human consumption. Studies focusing on the isolation of Brucella strains in camels and investigating brucellosis in ruminants and humans are recommended in the study area. Validation of serological tests—including c-ELISA—for Brucella antibody detection in camels is also needed.","Mohamud, Ahmed Said; Kothowa, John Pilate; Mfune, Ruth Lindizyani; Mubanga, Melai; Godfroid, Jacques; Muma, John B.",Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8309995/,447

Previous studies have focused on antibodies targeting the head or stem domains, while other possible specificities are often not taken into account. To study such specificities, we developed a diverse set of HA-domain proteins based on an H1N1(pdm2009)-like influenza virus strain, including monomeric head and trimeric stem domain, as well as the full HA-trimer. These proteins were used to study the B cell and antibody responses in six healthy human donors. A large proportion of HA-trimer B cells bound exclusively to HA-trimer probe (54–77%), while only 8–18% and 9–23% were able to recognize the stem or head probe, respectively. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were isolated and three of these mAbs, targeting the different domains, were characterized in-depth to confirm the binding profile observed in flow cytometry. The head-directed mAb, targeting an epitope distinct from known head-specific mAbs, showed relatively broad H1N1 neutralization and the stem-directed mAb was able to broadly neutralize diverse H1N1 viruses. Moreover, we identified a trimer-directed mAb that did not compete with known head or stem domain specific mAbs, suggesting that it targets an unknown epitope or conformation of influenza virus’ HA. These observations indicate that the described method can characterize the diverse antibody response to HA and might be able to identify HA-specific B cells and antibodies with previously unknown specificities that could be relevant for vaccine design.","Aartse, Aafke; Eggink, Dirk; Claireaux, Mathieu; van Leeuwen, Sarah; Mooij, Petra; Bogers, Willy M.; Sanders, Rogier W.; Koopman, Gerrit; van Gils, Marit J.",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8310015/,447

Although the capacity for recombination among betacoronaviruses is well documented, recombination between strains of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has not been characterized in detail. Here, we present a lightweight approach for detecting genomes that are potentially recombinant. This approach relies on identifying the mutations that primarily determine SARS-CoV-2 clade structure and then screening genomes for ones that contain multiple mutational markers from distinct clades. Among the over 537,000 genomes queried that were deposited on GISAID.org prior to 16 February 2021, we detected 1,175 potential recombinant sequences. Using a highly conservative criteria to exclude sequences that may have originated through de novo mutation, we find that at least 30 per cent (n = 358) are likely of recombinant origin. An analysis of deep-sequencing data for these putative recombinants, where available, indicated that the majority are high quality. Additional phylogenetic analysis and the observed co-circulation of predicted parent clades in the geographic regions of exposure further support the feasibility of recombination in this subset of potential recombinants. An analysis of these genomes did not reveal evidence for recombination hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. While most of the putative recombinant sequences we detected were genetic singletons, a small number of genetically identical or highly similar recombinant sequences were identified in the same geographic region, indicative of locally circulating lineages. Recombinant genomes were also found to have originated from parental lineages with substitutions of concern, including D614G, N501Y, E484K, and L452R. Adjusting for an unequal probability of detecting recombinants derived from different parent clades and for geographic variation in clade abundance, we estimate that at most 0.2–2.5 per cent of circulating viruses in the USA and UK are recombinant. Our identification of a small number of putative recombinants within the first year of SARS-CoV-2 circulation underscores the need to sustain efforts to monitor the emergence of new genotypes generated through recombination.","VanInsberghe, David; Neish, Andrew S; Lowen, Anice C; Koelle, Katia",Virus Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8344435/,447

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are currently being considered for the treatment of PF, but the regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. We co-cultured bone marrow-derived MSCs and mouse lung fibroblasts (MLg) in the presence of TGF-β1, and studied the protein/mRNA expression of fibrosis markers and related signaling pathways. The effects of miR-130a-3p and TGF-β receptor II (TGF-βRII) on the differentiation of MLg induced by TGF-β1 were studied using immunofluorescence assay, Western blot, and quantitative real-time PCR techniques, respectively. Our results showed that MSCs reversed the overexpression of fibrosis markers and TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway proteins and mRNAs after TGF-β1 treatment and increased the level of miR-130a-3p. TGF-βRII was identified as a target of miR-130a-3p and was evaluated by dual-luciferase reporter assay. The miR-130a-3p/TGF-βRII axis could suppress the differentiation of lung fibroblasts via the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway, thereby reducing the process of PF.","Liu, Yanhong; Ding, Yan; Hou, Yapeng; Yu, Tong; Nie, Hongguang; Cui, Yong",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8355625/,447

The purpose of this study was to develop a method that could be used to rapidly detect MAP infection in deer using the Actiphage Rapid blood test. This test has previously been used to detect MAP in cattle blood following the purification of buffy coat using Ficoll gradients, however this method is quite laborious and costly. The purpose of this study was to develop a simpler method of blood preparation that was also compatible with deer blood and the Actiphage test. Initially differential lysis of RBCs using Ammonium Chloride-Potassium (ACK) blood lysis buffer was compared with the Ficoll gradient centrifugation method using cattle blood samples for compatibility with the Actiphage reagents, and it was found that the simpler ACK method did not have an impact on the Actiphage test reagents, producing an equivalent sensitivity for detection of low levels of MAP. When the two methods were compared using clinical blood samples from farmed deer, the ACK lysis method resulted in a cleaner sample. When a blinded test of 132 animals from 4 different production groups was carried out, the majority of the positive test results were found to be from animals in just one group, with a small number identified in a second group. The test results were found to be reproducible when a small set of positive animals were tested again 1 month after their initial testing. Finally a set of negative animals which had been previously screened using an ELISA test, all animals gave a negative Actiphage result. This study shows that this improved sample preparation method and Actiphage blood testing can be used to test blood samples from deer, and the full diagnostic potential of the method can now be evaluated.","Kubala, Anton; Perehinec, Tania M.; Evans, Catherine; Pirovano, Andrea; Swift, Benjamin M.

However, the IPCC has faced criticism for its different organizational and functional biases which include a geographical bias favoring experts from the global north, a gender bias in favor of men, a disciplinary bias in favor of the natural sciences over the social sciences and humanities, and finally, a cosmological bias favoring western science over indigenous knowledges. In recent years, scholars have noted changes in the IPCC, pointing at the inclusion of social science/humanities perspectives and a growing engagement with plural worldviews. Despite such forays, all aspects of knowledge production within the IPCC still echo the aspirations of nation states and quantitative models of attribution and detection. Climate knowledge production in the Himalayan region reflects this reality. In this essay, we focus on our personal experiences with local communities from the Himalayas and bring it in dialogue with our experiences with the IPCC knowledge production process. In doing so, we have two objectives: first, to highlight marginalized stories of climate-society relationships that challenge normative climate science/policy and, second, in light of these stories, suggest some salient considerations required to foreground justice and equity in futureengagements with the IPCC, which explores the production of democratic knowledge and how such knowledge can be wielded to achieve regional climate justice.","Chakraborty, Ritodhi; Sherpa, Pasang Yangjee",Clim Change,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8381134/,447

Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the main clinical manifestations of SLE. It refers to the deposition of immune complexes in the glomeruli, which cause kidney inflammation. Although LN seriously affects prognosis and represents a key factor of disability and death in SLE patients, its mechanism remains unclear. The NACHT, leucine-rich repeat (LRR), and pyrin (PYD) domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome regulates IL-1β and IL-18 secretion and gasdermin D-mediated pyroptosis and plays a key role in innate immunity. There is increasing evidence that aberrant activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and downstream inflammatory pathways play an important part in the pathogenesis of multiple autoimmune diseases, including LN. This review summarizes research progress on the elucidation of NLRP3 activation, regulation, and recent clinical trials and experimental studies implicating the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathophysiology of LN. Current treatments fail to provide durable remission and provoke several sides effects, mainly due to their broad immunosuppressive effects. Therefore, the identification of a safe and effective therapeutic approach for LN is of great significance. Phytochemicals are found in many herbs, fruits, and vegetables and are secondary metabolites of plants. Evidence suggests that phytochemicals have broad biological activities and have good prospects in a variety of diseases, including LN. Therefore, this review reports on current research evaluating phytochemicals for targeting NLRP3 inflammasome pathways in LN therapy.","Wu, Dantong; Ai, Lianjie; Sun, Yanping; Yang, Bingyou; Chen, Sisi; Wang, Qiuhong; Kuang, Haixue",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8417800/,447

Transcriptome-wide mRNA expression analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was performed in five CAD patients and five controls. Functional enrichment analyses, protein–protein interaction network construction, and hub gene selection were further conducted. Relative expression levels of hub genes were validated by quantitative reverse transcription PCR in larger cohorts. Spearman correlation test and multiple linear regression analysis were applied to examine the relationship between confounding factors with severity of coronary artery atherosclerosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was adopted to identify potentially diagnostic biomarkers for CAD. A total of 527 upregulated and 653 downregulated mRNAs were identified as DEGs in CAD patients. The relative expression levels of beta-transducin repeat containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (BTRC), F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 4 (FBXL4), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 D2 (UBE2D2), and ankyrin repeat and SOCS box containing 1 (ASB1) were significantly different between two groups (all p ≤ 0.05). The severity of coronary artery atherosclerosis was negatively associated with the BTRC gene relative expression level (r = −0.323, p < 0.001) and positively with UBE2D2 (r = 0.285, p < 0.001). ROC analysis of BTRC and UBE2D2 genes showed that the areas under the curve were 0.782 (95% CI: 0.720–0.845, p < 0.001) and 0.753 (95% CI: 0.681–0.824, p < 0.001), respectively. We described the characteristics of mRNA expression in the peripheral blood of CAD patients and controls by RNA-seq. Combined with Spearman correlation analysis and ROC analyses, BTRC and UBE2D2 genes had significantly diagnostic values, which may have potential to act as novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for CAD.","Chen, Jia-Xin; He, Shu; Wang, Yan-Jun; Gan, Xiong-Kang; Zhou, Ya-Qing; Hua, Lei; Hou, Can; Zhang, Sheng; Zhou, Han-Xiao; Jia, En-Zhi",ACS Omega,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8459403/,447

58309,Wissenschaft in 5 Minuten,2021-10-06,"Interteaching is a behavioral teaching method that departs from the traditional lecture format (Boyce & Hineline in BA 25:215–226, 2002). We updated and expanded previous interteaching reviews and conducted a meta-analysis on its effectiveness. Systematic searches identified 38 relevant studies spanning the years 2005–2018. The majority of these studies were conducted in undergraduate face-to-face courses. The most common independent variables were manipulations of the configuration of interteaching or comparisons to traditional-lecture format. The most common dependent variables were quiz or examination scores. Only 24% of all studies implemented at least five of the seven components of interteaching. Prep guides, discussions, record sheets, and frequent assessments were the most commonly implemented. Meta-analyses indicated that interteaching is more effective than traditional lecture or other control conditions, with an overall large effect size. Furthermore, variations in the configuration of the interteaching components do not seem to substantially limit its effectiveness, as long as the discussion component is included. Future research informed by the present review includes: (a) investigating the efficacy of interteaching in additional academic areas, online environments, workplace training, and continuing education, (b) testing alternative outcome measures, generalization, and procedural integrity, (c) conducting systematic component analyses, and (d) measuring social validity from the instructor’s perspective.

58646,Zertifikat Kindertraumatologie im Fokus,2021-10-12,"PURPOSE: The rapid increase in the spread of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a need for reliable, effective, and readily available testing on a large scale. While diagnostic testing has been a support to public health, newer technology can be used to provide low-cost and convenient test options for patients. X-ray scanning can be performed to resolve this issue and produce quicker and more precise results. Currently, a radiologist is required to examine these X-ray images. However, deep convolutional neural networks can also be used to perform X-ray examinations and employed for the detection of COVID-19. We propose a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) with a fine-tuned deep transfer learning model to classify chest X-rays into six categories: COVID-Mild, COVID-Medium, COVID-Severe, Normal, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis. METHODS: A total of 1229 images were taken to form a dataset containing six classes corresponding to the six categories. A cGAN was used to increase the number of images. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are used to train a model for generating new images. cGAN is an extension of GAN consisting of a generator and discriminator network that are trained simultaneously to optimize the model. The generated images were then trained using deep transfer learning models such as ResNet50, Xception, and DenseNet-169 to achieve the classification into six classes. RESULTS: The proposed model helped achieve a training and validation accuracy of up to 98.20 % and 94.21 % respectively. The model was able to achieve a test accuracy of 93.67 %. The use of cGAN not only helped to increase the size of the training dataset but it also helped to reduce the problem of over-fitting. CONCLUSION: The proposed approach will help to diagnose COVID-19 quickly at an early stage.

58872,Der Aufbau der Europäischen Gesundheitsunion – Lernen aus der Corona-Krise,2021-10-07,"BACKGROUND: Paediatric chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is disabling and relatively common. Although evidenced-based treatments are available, at least 15% of children remain symptomatic after one year of treatment. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is an alternative therapy option; however, little is known about whether it is an acceptable treatment approach. Our aim was to find out if adolescents who remain symptomatic with CFS/ME after 12 months of treatment would find ACT acceptable, to inform a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of ACT. METHODS: We recruited adolescents (diagnosed with CFS/ME; not recovered after one year of treatment; aged 11–17 years), their parent/carer and healthcare professionals (HCPs) from one specialist UK paediatric CFS/ME service. We conducted semi-structured interviews to explore barriers to recovery; views on current treatments; acceptability of ACT; and feasibility of an effectiveness RCT. Thematic analysis was used to identify patterns in data. RESULTS: Twelve adolescents, eleven parents and seven HCPs were interviewed. All participants thought ACT was acceptable. Participants identified reasons why ACT might be efficacious: pragmatism, acceptance and compassion are valued in chronic illness; values-focussed treatment provides motivation and direction; psychological and physical needs are addressed; normalising difficulties is a useful life-skill. Some adolescents preferred ACT to cognitive behavioural therapy as it encouraged accepting (rather than challenging) thoughts. Most adolescents would consent to an RCT of ACT but a barrier to recruitment was reluctance to randomisation. All HCPs deemed ACT feasible to deliver. Some were concerned patients might confuse ‘acceptance’ with ‘giving up’ and called for clear explanations. All participants thought the timing of ACT should be individualised. CONCLUSIONS: All adolescents with CFS/ME, parents and HCPs thought ACT was acceptable, and most adolescents were willing to try ACT. An RCT needs to solve issues around randomisation and timing of the intervention.","Clery, Philippa; Starbuck, Jennifer; Laffan, Amanda; Parslow, Roxanne Morin; Linney, Catherine; Leveret, Jamie; Crawley, Esther",BMJ Paediatr Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8488698/,447

Innate immunity is the host’s first-line defense to bridge the acquired immunity against viral infections. However, hantavirus has evolved various strategies in both molecular and cellular aspects to evade the host’s natural immune surveillance. The Interferon-I (IFN-I) signaling pathway, a central link of host defense, induces various antiviral proteins to control the infection. This paper summarizes the molecular mechanisms of hantavirus evasion mechanisms of the IFN signaling pathway and cellular processes such as regulated cell death and cell stress. Besides, hantavirus could also evade immune surveillance evasion through cellular mechanisms, such as upregulating immune checkpoint molecules interfering with viral infections. Understanding hantavirus’s antiviral immune evasion mechanisms will deepen our understanding of its pathogenesis and help us develop more effective methods to control and eliminate hantavirus.","Zhang, Yusi; Ma, Ruixue; Wang, Yutong; Sun, Wenjie; Yang, Ziwei; Han, Mingwei; Han, Tixin; Wu, Xing-an; Liu, Rongrong",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8516094/,447
59860,Social Media Impact on a Plastic Surgery Clinic During Shutdown due to COVID-19 in China.,2020-04-16,"BACKGROUND Limited evidence exists about associations between road crash injury and economic status in sub-Saharan Africa from large, population-based data sets. Existing studies generally do not incorporate fatal crashes. This study aims to understand the relationship between relative wealth and road crash injury and severity using population-representative cross-sectional data from Uganda's 2016 Demographic and Health Survey . METHODS One-year road crash risk was flexibly modelled as a function of wealth using fractional polynomial models, stratified by sex and rural/urban residence. Wealth was operationalised as 1/20th quantiles of the first principal component from a polychoric principal component analysis. Injury severity was coded as a three-level ordinal variable; associations with wealth were modelled with ordinal logistic regression on quintiles of relative wealth, stratified by residence. RESULTS Overall, injury risk peaked in the upper middle of the wealth distribution. Rural resident injury risk increased monotonically with wealth. Urban resident risk had an upside-down U shape. Risk peaked in the distribution's middle at about double the lowest levels. Only urban men had higher risk among the least wealthy than most wealthy (3.2% vs 1.7%; difference=1.5 percentage points, 95% CI 0.2 to 2.7). Among those with road crash injuries, greater relative wealth was associated with decreased likelihood of more severe injury (33.2 percentage points lower in the highest category than lowest, 95% CI 18.4 to 48.1) or death (5.9 percentage points, 95% CI -0.1 to 11.8) for urban residents but not rural residents. CONCLUSION Relationships between relative wealth and injury risk and severity are complex and different for urban and rural Ugandans.","Kraemer, John D",Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention,https://doi.org/10.1136/injuryprev-2020-043871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32792365/,447

66437,Flexor tenorrhaphy using absorbable suture materials.,2012,"Background: The consumption of industrially produced trans fatty acids (TFAs) has been associated with an increased risk of heart disease. In recognition of this, countries, states, and cities worldwide have implemented TFA policies aimed at reducing their availability in the food supply. Objective: This article aims to provide an update of the evidence of the effectiveness of policies aimed at reducing TFAs in the food supply. Methods: A systematic review of the literature from 2013 onward was conducted, building on a previously published review that examined the evidence of the impact of TFA policies worldwide from 2000 to 2012. Studies that were 1) empirical, 2) examined a TFA policy, and 3) examined the effect of the policy on TFA amounts and availability pre- and post-policy intervention were included. Modeling studies examining the impact of TFA policies on cardiovascular, equity, and economic outcomes were also included. Results: A total of 18 articles from the updated search were combined with 14 articles from the previous review (total = 32 articles). All types of TFA policies led to their reduction; however, trans fat bans had a larger impact (TFAs virtually eliminated) than did voluntary (range: 20-38% reduction in TFA intakes) or labeling (range: 30-74% reduction in TFA intakes, plasma serum, or breast-milk concentrations) approaches to reducing TFA amounts in the food supply. Product reformulation to reduce TFAs had variable effects on saturated fatty acid (SFA) contents in these foods; however, the combined amount of TFAs and SFAs declined in most products. Overall, the modeling studies indicated that TFA bans would reduce heart disease risk, benefit socioeconomically disadvantaged populations the most, and be cost-saving. Conclusions: Policies aimed at reducing TFAs in the food supply are effective and will likely reduce the burden of diet-related disease, particularly among the most vulnerable socioeconomic groups. Although all policy approaches lead to reductions in TFAs in foods, TFA bans are likely the most effective, economical, and equitable policy approach to reducing TFAs in the food supply.","Downs, Shauna M; Bloem, Milan Z; Zheng, Miaobing; Catterall, Elise; Thomas, Beth; Veerman, Lennert; Wu, Jason Hy",Current developments in nutrition,https://doi.org/10.3945/cdn.117.000778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29955689/,447

Here, we report the development of what we believe to be a novel antigen-targeting DNA vaccine strategy that exploits the binding of programmed death-1 (PD1) to its ligands expressed on dendritic cells (DCs) by fusing soluble PD1 with HIV-1 GAG p24 antigen. As compared with non-DC-targeting vaccines, intramuscular immunization via electroporation (EP) of the fusion DNA in mice elicited consistently high frequencies of GAG-specific, broadly reactive, polyfunctional, long-lived, and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and robust anti-GAG antibody titers. Vaccination conferred remarkable protection against mucosal challenge with vaccinia GAG viruses. Soluble PD1-based vaccination potentiated CD8+ T cell responses by enhancing antigen binding and uptake in DCs and activation in the draining lymph node. It also increased IL-12-producing DCs and engaged antigen cross-presentation when compared with anti-DEC205 antibody-mediated DC targeting. The high frequency of durable and protective GAG-specific CD8+ T cell immunity induced by soluble PD1-based vaccination suggests that PD1-based DNA vaccines could potentially be used against HIV-1 and other pathogens.","Zhou, Jingying; Cheung, Allen K L; Tan, Zhiwu; Wang, Haibo; Yu, Wenbo; Du, Yanhua; Kang, Yuanxi; Lu, Xiaofan; Liu, Li; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Chen, Zhiwei",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci64704; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23635778/,447

The aim of this study was to quantify its incidence following laparoscopic repair of very large hiatus hernias, identify key risk factors for its occurrence and determine its impact on clinical outcomes. Methods Data collected from a randomized trial of patients who underwent laparoscopic mesh versus sutured repair of very large hiatus hernias (more than 50 per cent of stomach in chest) were analysed retrospectively. Delayed gastric emptying was defined as endoscopic evidence of solid food in the stomach after fasting for 6 h at 6 months after surgery. Results Delayed gastric emptying occurred in 19 of 102 patients (18·6 per cent). In univariable analysis, type 2 paraoesophageal hernia (relative risk (RR) 3·15, 95 per cent c.i. 1·41 to 7·06), concurrent anterior and posterior hiatal repair (RR 2·66, 1·14 to 6·18), hernia sac excision (RR 4·85, 1·65 to 14·24), 270°/360° fundoplication (RR 3·64, 1·72 to 7·68), division of short gastric vessels (RR 6·82, 2·12 to 21·90) and revisional surgery (RR 3·69, 1·73 to 7·87) correlated with delayed gastric emptying. In multivariable analysis, division of short gastric vessels (RR 6·27, 1·85 to 21·26) and revisional surgery (RR 6·19, 1·32 to 28·96) were independently associated with delayed gastric emptying. Delayed gastric emptying correlated with adverse gastrointestinal symptomatology, including higher rates of bloating, nausea, vomiting and anorexia, as well as reduced patient satisfaction with the operation and recovery. Conclusion Delayed gastric emptying following large hiatus hernia repair is common and associated with adverse symptoms and reduced patient satisfaction.

Despite the lack of direct antiviral effects, tocilizumab could reduce the immune-induced organ damage caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection. Until recently, most reports on tocilizumab for COVID-19 included a limited number of patients, preventing an overall evaluation of its efficacy and safety for this specific condition. Therefore, we reviewed the literature regarding the physiopathological rationale of tocilizumab for COVID-19 and its outcomes.

Of interest, shifts of the relationships between microbes and their hosts or environments are associated with critical diseases and ecological changes. While advances in high-throughput Omics technologies offer a great opportunity for understanding the structures and functions of microbiome, it is still challenging to analyse and interpret the omics data. Specifically, the heterogeneity and diversity of microbial communities, compounded with the large size of the datasets, impose a tremendous challenge to mechanistically elucidate the complex communities. Fortunately, network analyses provide an efficient way to tackle this problem, and several network approaches have been proposed to improve this understanding recently. Here, we systemically illustrate these network theories that have been used in biological and biomedical research. Then, we review existing network modelling methods of microbial studies at multiple layers from metagenomics to metabolomics and further to multi-omics. Lastly, we discuss the limitations of present studies and provide a perspective for further directions in support of the understanding of microbial communities.","Liu, Zhaoqian; Ma, Anjun; Mathé, Ewy; Merling, Marlena; Ma, Qin; Liu, Bingqiang",Briefings in bioinformatics,https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbaa005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32047891/,447
81720,Medial Epicanthoplasty: What Works and What Does Not.,2020-09-16,"Monoclonal antibody isolation directly from circulating human B cells is a powerful tool to delineate humoral responses to pathological conditions and discover antibody therapeutics. We have developed a platform aimed at improving the efficiencies of B cell selection and V gene recovery. Here, memory B cells are activated and amplified using Epstein-Barr virus infection, co-cultured with CHO-muCD40L cells, and then assessed by functional screenings. An in vitro transcription and translation (IVTT) approach was used to analyze variable (V) genes recovered from each B cell sample and identify the relevant heavy/light chain pair(s). We achieved efficient amplification and activation of memory B cells, and eliminated the need to: 1) seed B cells at clonal level (≤1 cell/well) or perform limited dilution cloning; 2) immortalize B cells; or 3) assemble V genes into an IgG expression vector to confirm the relevant heavy/light chain pairing. Cross-reactive antibodies targeting a conserved epitope on influenza A hemagglutinin were successfully isolated from a healthy donor. In-depth analysis of the isolated antibodies suggested their potential uses as anti-influenza A antibody therapeutics and uncovered a distinct affinity maturation pathway. Importantly, our results showed that cognate heavy/light chain pairings contributed to both the expression level and binding abilities of our newly isolated VH1-69 family, influenza A neutralizing antibodies, contrasting with previous observations that light chains do not significantly contribute to the function of this group of antibodies. Our results further suggest the potential use of the IVTT as a powerful antibody developability assessment tool.","Xiao, Xiaodong; Chen, Yan; Varkey, Reena; Kallewaard, Nicole; Koksal, Adem C; Zhu, Qing; Wu, Herren; Chowdhury, Partha S; Dall'Acqua, William F",mAbs,https://doi.org/10.1080/19420862.2016.1170263; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27049174/,447

While these changes generally resolve after parturition, the impact of subsequent pregnancies on the risk of atrial fibrillation is unknown. We searched through PubMed for studies that have investigated the impact of multiparity on the risk of atrial fibrillation. The following Medical Subject Headings terms were used: ([repeated pregnancies] OR parity) AND ([Atrial fibrillation] OR AF). Studies with complete data were included in the current study. Out of 135 studies identified through the prespecified criteria, we selected 2 studies with relevant data. Increasing number of pregnancies was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation in a dose-response relationship. Our systematic review suggests that multiparity is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation. More studies are warranted to elucidate the association between repeated pregnancies and atrial fibrillation.","Kiage, James N; Minhas, Sheharyar; Hana, David; Khouzam, Nadim; Khouzam, Amir; Kabra, Rajesh",Current problems in cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2020.100697; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004225/,447

90592,How webinars have lit residents' interest in aesthetic surgery during COVID-19.,2020-07-21,"Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are responsible for a large proportion of the health care dollar expenditure, morbidity, and mortality related to COPD. Respiratory infections are the most common cause of acute exacerbations, but recent evidence indicates that the importance of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in COPD is under-appreciated. Improved detection of RSV using techniques based on the polymerase chain reaction accounts for much of the increased recognition of the importance of this virus in COPD patients. Furthermore, COPD patients may be more susceptible to RSV infection, possibly due to RSV-or immune response-induced pulmonary effects that are altered by age, environmental exposures, genetics, COPD itself, or a combination of these. However, although RSV infection occurs throughout life, viral and host factors that place COPD patients at increased risk are unclear. The complexities of RSV effects in COPD present opportunities for research with the goal of developing approaches to selectively modify damaging viral effects (e.g., altered airway function), while retaining beneficial immunity (e.g., clearance of virus) in COPD patients. This review explores the role RSV plays in acute exacerbations of COPD, the potential for RSV disease in chronic stable COPD, and newer concepts in RSV diagnosis, epidemiology, and host defense.","Ramaswamy, Murali; Groskreutz, Dayna J; Look, Dwight C",COPD,https://doi.org/10.1080/15412550902724024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19229710/,447

He had experienced septic shock and was medicated with continuous infusion of noradrenaline through a peripheral vein, in order to maintain sufficient blood pressure. However, indwelling peripheral venous catheters were difficult to place and maintain. DIAGNOSIS The patient experienced orthopnea due to congestive heart failure and could not assume any other position. INTERVENTIONS An anesthesiologist performed PICC placement while the patient was in the sitting position, using ultrasound guidance. OUTCOMES The patient's orthopnea was slightly ameliorated, and he was able to sleep at night. LESSONS The technique of inserting a PICC in the sitting position is simple and feasible.

Several studies have demonstrated the capacity of Candida albicans to induce a Th17 response. Surprisingly, experiments employing live C. ablicans demonstrated a specific downregulation of host IL-17 secretion in human blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). By avoiding the direct contact of live C. albicans and PBMCs, we demonstrate that this inhibition effect is mediated by a soluble factor released by live C. albicans. However, this effect is due neither to the releasing of C. albicans pathogen-associated molecular patterns nor to the alteration of different Th cell subtypes. Rather, we found that live C. albicans shifts tryptophan metabolism by inhibiting IDO expression away from kynurenines and toward 5-hydroxytryptophan metabolites. In addition, we show that these latter 5-hydroxytryptophan metabolites inhibit IL-17 production. In conclusion, live C. albicans inhibits host Th17 responses by modulatory effects on tryptophan metabolism.","Cheng, Shih-Chin; van de Veerdonk, Frank; Smeekens, Sanne; Joosten, Leo A B; van der Meer, Jos W M; Kullberg, Bart-Jan; Netea, Mihai G",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1000756; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20624941/,447

We assessed the accuracy and workload of search date limits on the meta-analytical results to determine the best rapid strategy. The meta-analyses data were collected from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). We emulated the rapid reviews by limiting the search date of the original CDSR to the recent 40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 7, 5, and 3 years, and their results were compared to the full meta-analyses. A random sample of 10% was drawn to repeat the literature search by the same timeframe limits to measure the relative workload reduction (RWR). The relationship between accuracy and RWR was established. We identified 21,363 meta-analyses of binary outcomes and 7683 meta-analyses of continuous outcomes from 2693 CDSRs. Our results suggested that under a maximum tolerance of 5% and 10% on the bias of magnitude, a limit on the recent 20 years can achieve good accuracy and at the same time save the most workload. Under the tolerance of 15% and 20% on the bias, a limit on the recent 10 years and 15 years could be considered. Limiting the search date is a valid rapid method to produce credible evidence for timely decisions. When conducting rapid reviews, researchers should consider both the accuracy and workload to make an appropriate decision. This article is protected by copyright.

100578,Quantification of Plasma Oxylipins Using Solid-Phase Extraction and Reversed-Phase Liquid Chromatography-Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry.,2021,"Objective: To investigate the causes of death in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 64 patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 12, 2020 to February 28, 2020. There were 36 males and 28 females, aging from 44 to 85 years[median 68 (62, 72)]. Fifty-two patients (81%) had underlying comorbidities. The patients were divided into the death group (n=40) and the survival group (n=24) according to the treatment outcomes. In the death group, 24 were male, and 16 were female, aging from 49 to 85 years [median 69 (62, 72)], with 31 cases (78%) complicated with underlying diseases. In the survival group, there were 12 males and 12 females, aging from 44 to 82 years[median 66 (61,73)], with 21 cases (88%) with comorbidities. Clinical data of the two groups were collected and compared, including general information, laboratory examinations, imaging features and treatments. For normally distributed data, independent group t test was used; otherwise, Mann Whitney test was used to compare the variables. χ(2) test and Fisher exact test was used when analyzing categorical variables. Results: The median of creatine kinase isozyme (CK-MB) in the death group was 19.0 (17.0,23.0) U/L, which was higher than that in the survival group 16.5 (13.5,19.6) U/L. The median level of cTnI in the death group was 0.03 (0.03, 0.07) μg/L, which was significantly higher than that in the survival group (0.02, 0.03) μg/L, with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P=0.007). The concentration of myoglobin in the death group was 79.5 (28.7, 189.0) μg/L, which was higher than 33.1 (25.7, 54.5) μg/L in the survival group. The level of D-dimer in the death group was 2.0 (0.6, 5.2) mg/L, which was higher than 0.7 (0.4, 2.0) mg/L in the survival group. The LDH level of the death group was 465.0 (337.5,606.5) U/L, which was higher than that of the survibal group, 341.0 (284.0,430.0) U/L, the difference being statistically significant (P=0.006). The concentration of alanine aminotransferase in the death group was 40.0 (30.0, 48.0) U/L, which was higher than 32.5 (24.0, 40.8) U/L in the survival group, and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.047).Abnormal ECG was found in 16 cases (62%) in the death group, which was significantly higher than that in the survival group (29%), the difference being statistically significant (P=0.024) .The main causes of death were severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS, n=20), acute heart failure(n=9), atrial fibrillation(n=3) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS, n=3). Conclusions: ARDS caused by severe pneumonia and acute heart failure and atrial fibrillation caused by acute viral myocarditis were the main causes of death in severe COVID-19 patients. Early prevention of myocardial injury and treatment of acute viral myocarditis complicated with disease progression may provide insights into treatment and reduction of mortality in patients with severe COVID-19.","Zhu, Q; Zhang, W; Wang, Q; Liu, J H; Wu, C H; Luo, T; Peng, P",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200308-00275; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32727177/,447

102643,Stormwater management impacts of small urbanising towns: The necessity of investigating the 'devil in the detail'.,2020-11-20,"Lonicera japonica Thunb. is a well-known traditional herbal medicine in most East Asian countries. In China, the flower bud and stem of this plant are used for various clinical therapies, while the leaf is not officially recognized as an active part. Due to the similarities in their chemical constituents but great differences in their commercial values, the flower bud has been found to be adulterated with leaf and/or stem during the production of formulations by some drug manufactures. In order to identify adulteration in products and enable quality control, it is necessary to chemically discriminate these three parts of L. japonica. In the current study, an HPLC-ESI-MS(n) method was developed and validated for the quantitative analysis of 18 bioactive compounds: 7 organic acids, 6 iridoids, and 5 flavonoids, in batches of flower bud, stem, and leaf samples. Subsequently, chemometric analyses, such as one-way analysis of variance, principal component analysis, and hierarchical clustering analysis, were performed based on the quantitative data. The results indicated that there were remarkable differences in the distribution of the investigated compounds among the three parts of L. japonica, and that they could be straightforwardly and reliably distinguished according to their chemical profiles. Twelve compounds were selected as potential differential metabolites, which would be useful for quality control of L. japonica. As the content of caffeic acid was low in the flower bud but much higher in the stem and leaf, it could be used as a chemical marker to identify adulteration.","Wang, Ya-Dan; He, Yi; Dai, Zhong; Kang, Shuai; Zhang, Ji; Ma, Shuang-Cheng",Journal of Asian natural products research,https://doi.org/10.1080/10286020.2016.1205039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27477009/,447
103741,Building a virtuous cycle of surgical cleft-craniofacial care by combining surgeon centered outcome and patient reported outcome measures.,2020-02-18,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Plants use diffuse light more efficiently than direct light. However, experimental comparisons between diffuse and direct light have been obscured by co-occurring differences in environmental conditions (e.g. light intensity). This study aims to analyse the factors that contribute to an increase in crop photosynthesis in diffuse light and to quantify their relative contribution under different levels of diffuseness at similar light intensities. The hypothesis is that the enhancement of crop photosynthesis in diffuse light results not only from the direct effects of more uniform vertical and horizontal light distribution in the crop canopy, but also from crop physiological and morphological acclimation. METHODS Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) crops were grown in three greenhouse compartments that were covered by glass with different degrees of light diffuseness (0, 45 and 71 % of the direct light being converted into diffuse light) while maintaining similar light transmission. Measurements of horizontal and vertical photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) distribution in the crop, leaf photosynthesis light response curves and leaf area index (LAI) were used to quantify each factor's contribution to an increase in crop photosynthesis in diffuse light. In addition, leaf temperature, photoinhibition, and leaf biochemical and anatomical properties were studied. KEY RESULTS The highest degree of light diffuseness (71 %) increased the calculated crop photosynthesis by 7·2 %. This effect was mainly attributed to a more uniform horizontal (33 % of the total effect) and vertical PPFD distribution (21 %) in the crop. In addition, plants acclimated to the high level of diffuseness by gaining a higher photosynthetic capacity of leaves in the middle of the crop and a higher LAI, which contributed 23 and 13 %, respectively, to the total increase in crop photosynthesis in diffuse light. Moreover, diffuse light resulted in lower leaf temperatures and less photoinhibition at the top of the canopy when global irradiance was high. CONCLUSIONS Diffuse light enhanced crop photosynthesis. A more uniform horizontal PPFD distribution played the most important role in this enhancement, and a more uniform vertical PPFD distribution and higher leaf photosynthetic capacity contributed more to the enhancement of crop photosynthesis than did higher values of LAI.","Li, T; Heuvelink, E; Dueck, T A; Janse, J; Gort, G; Marcelis, L F M",Annals of botany,https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcu071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24782436/,447

This study aimed to compare the level of anxiety and depression in the same pregnant women before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The pregnant women continuing pregnancy who participated in the first study which was undertaken to clarify the factors associated with mental health of pregnant women before the COVID-19 pandemic, were included for the current study during the outbreak. Anxiety and depression symptoms of the same pregnant women were evaluated by using the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms II and Beck Anxiety Inventory twice before and during the pandemic. Results A total of 63 pregnant women completed questionnaires. The mean age of the women and the mean gestational age was 30.35±5.27 years and 32.5±7 weeks, respectively. The mean total IDAS II score was found to increase from 184.78±49.67 (min: 109, max: 308) to 202.57±52.90 (min: 104, max: 329) before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. According to the BAI scores the number of patients without anxiety (from 10 to 6) and with mild anxiety (from 31 to 24) decreased and patients with moderate (from 20 to 25) and severe anxiety (from 2 to 8) increased after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that obesity and relationship with her husband are the best predictors of IDAS II scores. Conclusions This study indicated that COVID-19 outbreak affects the mental health of pregnant women negatively which leads to adverse birth outcomes. The level of anxiety and depression symptoms of pregnant women during the COVID-19 infection significantly increased.

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the potential for blood splatter of 6 designs of winged phlebotomy devices. DESIGN A laboratory-based device evaluation without human subjects, using a simulated patient venous system. METHODS We evaluated 18 winged phlebotomy devices of 6 device designs by Terumo, BD Vacutainer (2 designs), Greiner, Smith Medical, and Kendall (designated A-F, respectively). Scientific filters were positioned around the devices and weighed before and after venipuncture was performed. Visible blood on filters, exam gloves, and devices and measurable blood splatter were the primary units of analysis. RESULTS The percentages of devices and gloves with visible blood on them and filters with measurable blood splatter ranged from 0% to 20%. There was a statistically significant association between device design and visible blood on devices ([Formula: see text]) and between device design and filters with measurable blood splatter ([Formula: see text]), but not between device design and visible blood on gloves. A wide range of associations were demonstrated between device design and visible blood on gloves or devices and incidence of blood splatter. CONCLUSIONS The results of this evaluation suggest that winged phlebotomy devices with ESIP may produce blood splatter during venipuncture. Reinforcing the importance of eye protection and developing a methodology to assess ocular exposure to blood splatter are major implications for healthcare personnel who use these devices.

105948,Natural biflavonoids as potential therapeutic agents against microbial diseases.,2021-01-16,"BACKGROUND After receiving a cancer diagnosis patients face many challenges. The association between career situation and financial problems caused by cancer has a substantial impact on quality of life (QoL) among cancer patients. Indeed, the QoL such as physical and mental health of cancer patients is lower when the risk of psychological disorders or distress increases, and chances for cancer cure are reduced. Progress in therapeutic intervention allows many cancer patients a social reintegration into their careers. About one third of cancer patients are younger than 65 years, and with the constant increase in work life periods, a cancer diagnosis also presents a financial burden for those affected. OBJECTIVES The main objective of this study was to analyse the social QoL in the context of factors related to career and financial situation among patients diagnosed with soft tissue sarcomas (STS). METHODS A descriptive non-experimental research design was used to conduct a cross-sectional survey over a period of 6 months, between May and November 2016, in collaboration with the Sarcoma Unit at the Mannheim University Medical Centre, Mannheim, Germany, the patient organisation ""Das Lebenshaus e.V.,"" and the German Pension Insurance Hessen (Deutsche Ren-tenversicherung: DRV Hessen)/Pension Fund. We analysed data of 30 patients diagnosed with STS using self-outcome questionnaires in combination with retirement insurance data from the date of first diagnosis up to 3 years afterwards. Out of 280 questionnaires, we received 86 completed forms, of which 56 were excluded. The remaining questionnaires of 30 patients were analysed according to self-determined outcomes and included a calculation of the financial changes caused by the disease. Only patients covered by pension insurance were included in the study. RESULTS Thirty patients (24 women) whose median age at first diagnosis was 48.7 years (range 31-61 years) were included in the analysis. The average unemployment rate was 8.8 months, and for 67% (20 patients) the employment situation changed after the period of unemployment. Eight patients requested a retirement pension (reduced income insurance), 4 patients reduced their weekly working hours, and 3 patients lost their jobs due to complications of the disease. The data analysis revealed that, among these patients, one benefited from an income increase of about 24%, another one received a regular old-age pension, and 4 patients reported reduced income for other reasons. In total, mean income has been reduced by 26%. Considering only the 8 patients who applied for a pension, partial or total unemployment benefits resulted in an average loss of income of up to 62%. CONCLUSIONS Reduced ability to work may cause severe financial problems for those affected by the diagnosis of STS. We found an average income reduction of 26%, for those requesting pension payments of 62%. This eventually relates to a higher risk of reduced wealth and may lower the patients' social standing.","Laros, Nele; Sungu-Winkler, Kiangenda Trésor; Gutermuth, Susanne; Wartenberg, Markus; Hohenberger, Peter; Seifart, Ulf; Kasper, Bernd",Oncology research and treatment,https://doi.org/10.1159/000509518; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937624/,447
107560,The COVID-19 Pandemic: Crisis Management for Plastic Surgeons.,2020-06-08,"OBJECTIVES Numerous devices have been successfully introduced in off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (OPCABG) surgery, most of them being disposable tools based on suction stabilization. Coronéo Cor-Vasc is a reusable system combining suction positioning with compression stabilization. The purpose of this study was to analyze our experience in OPCABG with the Cor-Vasc system. METHODS Between March 2001 and May 2008, 141 patients (age = 71.1 +/- 7.5 years) underwent OPCABG surgery using the Cor-Vasc system, representing 6.3% of the case volume of isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery in the same period. Eighty-eight patients (62.4%) underwent surgery on an urgent basis. In 95 patients (67.4%), the OPCABG option was selected after finding a diseased ascending aorta at intraoperative epiaortic ultrasound. RESULTS Among 334 anastomoses (mean = 2.4 +/- 1 per patient), 242 (95 patients) were fashioned with bilateral and 54 (46 patients) with single internal thoracic artery, respectively. In 89.4 and 73% of patients, a complete and a total arterial myocardial revascularization was achieved, respectively. There were two strokes (1.4%) and two myocardial infarctions (1.4%). Two patients died in the hospital (1.4%). Median ICU and in-hospital length of stay were 31.2 h and 10 days, respectively. CONCLUSION In our experience, the use of the Cor-Vasc system, including the device-learning curve, was associated with low mortality and morbidity indexes in an aged population with a high risk of stroke. The system appeared to be sufficiently versatile and potentially cost-effective when compared with disposable devices.","Spina, Amedeo; Benussi, Bernardo; Pappalardo, Aniello; Forti, Gabriella; Tognolli, Umberto; Gabrielli, Marco; Gatti, Giuseppe; Zingone, Bartolo",Journal of cardiovascular medicine,https://doi.org/10.2459/jcm.0b013e328337993d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20186068/,447
108299,The Importance of Calibration of Projectometers for Intraoperative Rhinoplasty Profile Measurement.,2020-09-16,"Variants of concern of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with an asparagine-to-tyrosine substitution at position 501 (N501Y) in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) show enhanced infectivity compared to wild-type, resulting in an altered pandemic situation in affected areas. These SARS-Cov-2 variants comprise the two Alpha variants (B.1.1.7, United Kingdom and B.1.1.7 with the additional E484K mutation), the Beta variant (B.1.351, South Africa), and the Gamma variant (P.1, Brazil). Understanding the binding modalities between these viral variants and the host cell receptor ACE2 allows to depict changes, but also common motifs of virus-host cell interaction. The trimeric spike protein expressed at the viral surface contains the RBD that forms the molecular interface with ACE2. All the above-mentioned variants carry between one and three amino acid exchanges within the interface-forming region of the RBD, thereby altering the binding interface with ACE2. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and decomposition of intermolecular contacts between the RBD and ACE2, we identified phenylalanine 486, glutamine 498, threonine 500, and tyrosine 505 as important interface-forming residues across viral variants. However, especially the N501Y exchange increased contact formation for this residue and also induced some local conformational changes. Comparing here, the in silico generated B.1.1.7 RBD-ACE2 complex with the now available experimentally solved structure reveals very similar behavior during MD simulation. We demonstrate, how computational methods can help to identify differences in conformation as well as contact formation for newly emerging viral variants. Altogether, we provide extensive data on all N501Y expressing SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with respect to their interaction with ACE2 and how this induces reshaping of the RBD-ACE2 interface.","Socher, Eileen; Conrad, Marcus; Heger, Lukas; Paulsen, Friedrich; Sticht, Heinrich; Zunke, Friederike; Arnold, Philipp",Journal of cellular biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcb.30142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34516024/,447

Einführung der Telematik-Infrastruktur, GSAV und ASV.",2020-12-01,"OBJECTIVE Platelets, blood coagulation along with fibrinolysis are greatly involved in the pathophysiology of infectious diseases induced by bacteria, parasites and virus. This phenomenon is not surprising since both the innate immunity and the hemostatic systems are two ancestral mechanisms which closely cooperate favoring host's defense against foreign invaders. However, the excessive response of these systems may be dangerous for the host itself. MATERIALS AND METHODS We searched and retrieved the articles, using the following electronic database: MedLine and Embase. We limited our search to articles published in English, but no restrictions in terms of article type, publication year, and geography were adopted. RESULTS The hemostatic phenotype of the infectious diseases is variable depending on the points of attack of the different involved pathogens. Infectious diseases which show a prothrombotic phenotype are bacterial sepsis, SARS-CoV-2 and malaria. However, among the bacterial sepsis, Yersinia Pestis is characterized by a profibrinolytic behavior. On the contrary, the hemorrhagic fevers, due to Dengue and Ebola virus, mainly exploit the activation of fibrinolysis secondary to a huge endothelial damage which can release a large amount of t-PA in the early phase of the diseases. CONCLUSIONS Blood coagulation and fibrinolysis are greatly activated based on the strategy of the different infectious agents which exploit the excess of response of both systems to achieve the greatest possible virulence.","Marongiu, F; Grandone, E; Scano, A; Orrù, G; Marongiu, S; Gerosa, C; Fanni, D; Faa, G; Barcellona, D",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202105_25956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34109597/,447

Individuals after stroke answered the ABILOCO-Brazil questionnaire on two randomized occasions, face-to-face and by telephone, 5-7 days apart. The mean difference between the interviews was reported. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated to investigate the agreement between the total scores, and weighted-Kappa statistics to investigate the agreement between the individual items. A total of 92 individuals were included. There was no significant difference in the mean scores between face-to-face and telephone-based applications of the ABILOCO [mean difference 0.17 logits; 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.88 to 0.54]. A high level of agreement was found between the ABILOCO total scores obtained between both applications (ICC = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.93), and most of the individual items had, on average, moderate agreement.

There are 25 drugs formally approved for HIV currently on the market, but side effects as well as the emergence of HIV strains showing single or multiple resistances to current drug-therapy are causes for concern. Furthermore, these drugs target only 4 steps of the viral cycle, hence the urgent need for new drugs and also new targets. In order to tackle this problem, we have devised a cell-based assay using lentiviral particles to look for post-entry inhibitors of HIV-1. We report here the assay development, validation as well as confirmation of the hits using both wild-type and drug-resistant HIV-1 viruses. The screening was performed on an original library, rich in natural compounds and pure molecules from Traditional Chinese Medicine pharmacopoeia, which had never been screened for anti-HIV activity. The identified hits belong to four chemical sub-families that appear to be all non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Secondary tests with live viruses showed that there was good agreement with pseudotyped particles, confirming the validity of this approach for high-throughput drug screens. This assay will be a useful tool that can be easily adapted to screen for inhibitors of viral entry.","Garcia, Jean-Michel; Gao, Anhui; He, Pei-Lan; Choi, Joyce; Tang, Wei; Bruzzone, Roberto; Schwartz, Olivier; Naya, Hugo; Nan, Fa-Jun; Li, Jia; Altmeyer, Ralf; Zuo, Jian-Ping",Antiviral research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2008.12.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19118579/,447

Herein, we demonstrate for the first time an electrofluidic approach to controlled delivery into soft tissue models based on gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels. This was achieved using a surgical suture, whereby transport of bioactive molecules, including drugs and proteins, was controlled by imposition of an electric field. Commonly employed surgical sutures or acrylic threads were integrated through the hydrogels to facilitate the directed introduction of bioactive species. The platform consisted of two reservoirs into which the ends of the thread were immersed. The anode and cathode were placed separately into each reservoir. The thread was taken from one reservoir to the other through the gel. When current was applied, biomolecules loaded onto the thread were directed into the gel. Under the same conditions, the rate of movement of the biomolecules along GelMA was dependent on the magnitude of the current. Using 5% GelMA and a current of 100 µA, 2 uL of fluorescein travelled through the hydrogel at a constant velocity of 7.17 ± 0.50 um/s and took less than 8 minutes to exit on the thread. Small molecules such as riboflavin migrated faster (5.99 ± 0.40 μm/s) than larger molecules such as dextran (2.26 ± 0.55 μm/s with 4 kDa) or BSA (0.33 ± 0.07 μm/s with 66.5 kDa). A number of commercial surgical sutures were tested and found to accommodate the controlled movement of biomolecules. Polyester, polyglactin 910, glycolide/lactide copolymer and polyglycolic acid braided sutures created adequate fluid connection between the electrodes and the hydrogel. With a view to application in skin inflammatory diseases and wound treatment, wound healing, slow and controlled delivery of dexamethasone 21-phosphate disodium salt (DSP), an anti-inflammatory prodrug, was achieved using medical surgicryl PGA absorbable suture. After 2 hours of electrical stimulation, still 81.1% of the drug loaded was encapsulated within the hydrogel.","Cabot, Joan M; Daikuara, Luciana Y; Yue, Zhilian; Hayes, Patricia; Liu, Xiao; Wallace, Gordon G; Paull, Brett",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63785-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345999/,447

It has been speculated that renin angiotensin system (RAS) blockers may promote COVID-19 by increasing ACE2, which SARS-CoV-2 uses to enter host cells, along with the host protease TMPRSS2. Taking a reverse translational approach and by combining in situ hybridization, primary cell isolation, immunoblotting, qRT-PCR and LC-MS/MS we studied lung and kidney ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in diabetic mice mimicking host factors linked to severe COVID-19. In healthy young mice, neither the ACE inhibitor ramipril nor the AT1 receptor blocker telmisartan affected lung or kidney ACE2 or TMPRSS2, except for a small increase in kidney ACE2 protein with ramipril. In contrast, mice with comorbid diabetes (aging, high fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetes) had heightened lung ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein levels and increased lung ACE2 activity. None of these parameters were affected by RAS blockade. ACE2 was similarly upregulated in the kidneys of mice with comorbid diabetes compared to aged controls, whereas TMPRSS2 (primarily distal nephron) was highest in telmisartan-treated animals. Upregulation of lung ACE2 activity in comorbid diabetes may contribute to increased risk of severe COVID-19. This upregulation is driven by comorbidity and not by RAS blockade.","Batchu, Sri Nagarjun; Kaur, Harmandeep; Yerra, Veera Ganesh; Advani, Suzanne L; Kabir, Md Golam; Liu, Youan; Klein, Thomas; Advani, Andrew",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db20-0765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33310740/,447

This paper will outline economics pertaining to COVID-19 lockdown, recovery and the inevitable competition that will occur between countries for tourists who will be scarcer and therefore more valuable. Countries are competing with a variety of incentives in order to lure visitors. However, persistent first waves that extend into July will put off tourists, further reducing tourism revenues and accelerate job losses and bankruptcies in affected countries. The example of Sweden's response to COVID-19 in this regard will be described. Countries that have COVID-19 relatively under control but experience second waves will also manifest negative tourism effects. Governments and public health must act in unison so as to exit lockdown as speedily and as safely as feasible, with COVID-19 rises that are as low and brief as possible in order to better compete in the tourism sector with other countries.

Water condensates, resulting from the use of humidifiers, but also residual nebulization particles may have a major influence on expiratory limb resistance. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the influence of nebulization and active humidification on the resistance of expiratory filters. METHODS A respiratory system analog was constructed using a test lung, an ICU ventilator, heated humidifiers, and a piezoelectric nebulizer. Humidifiers were connected to different types of circuits (unheated, mono-heated, new-generation and old-generation bi-heated). Five filter types were evaluated: electrostatic, heat-and-moisture exchanger, standard, specific, and internal heated high-efficiency particulate air [HEPA] filter. Baseline characteristics were obtained from each dry filter. Differential pressure measurements were carried out after 24 hours of continuous in vitro use for each condition, and after 24 hours of use with an old-generation bi-heated circuit without nebulization. RESULTS While using unheated circuits, measurements had to be interrupted before 24 hours for all the filtering devices except the internal heated HEPA filter. The heat-and-moisture exchangers occluded before 24 hours with the unheated and mono-heated circuits. The circuit type, nebulization practice, and duration of use did not influence the internal heated HEPA filter resistance. CONCLUSION Expiratory limb filtration is likely to induce several major adverse events. Expiratory filter resistance increase is due mainly to the humidification circuit type, rather than to nebulization. If filtration is mandatory while using an unheated circuit, a dedicated filter should be used for ≤ 24 hours, or a heated HEPA for a longer duration.","Tonnelier, Alexandre; Lellouche, François; Bouchard, Pierre Alexandre; L'Her, Erwan",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.01785; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23232732/,447

Current interventions to facilitate engagement in care focus primarily on the patient; however, many individuals with MCC manage and live with their conditions within the context of their family. This review sought to identify interventions used to facilitate patient and/or family engagement among adults with MCC. METHODS We adhered as closely as possible to PRISMA guidelines and conducted a systematic scoping review using a modified approach by Arksey and O'Malley. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus using terms related to MCC, patient and family engagement, and intervention. We included articles that: (1) were published in English; (2) were peer-reviewed; (3) described an engagement intervention (with or without a comparator); and (4) targeted individuals with MCC. We abstracted data from included articles and classified them using the Multidimensional Framework for Patient and Family Engagement in Health and Health Care, and the Classification Model of Patient Engagement. RESULTS We identified 21 discrete interventions. Six (29%) were classified as having the highest degree of engagement. Eighteen (85%) focused on engagement at the direct care level. Only one was specifically designed to engage families. CONCLUSIONS Many engagement interventions currently exist for adults with MCC. Few of these interventions foster the highest degree of engagement; most focus on engagement at the level of direct care and do not specifically target family member involvement.","Daniel, Obinna; Dest, Alex; Munson, Alexandra; Pulley, Deren V; Sadeghzadeh, Claire; Golin, Carol; Cené, Crystal W",Medical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mlr.0000000000001274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31914106/,447

MPs can be directly released to water or formed by the degradation of bigger plastics. Nowadays, it is estimated that annually between 4 and 12 million tonnes of plastic go into the seas and oceans-with a forecast for them to outweigh the amount of fish in 2050. Based on the existing studies, the characterization of MPs in waters is still one of the remaining challenges because they can be easily confused with organic or other types of matter. Consequently, there is an urgent necessity to establish pathways for the chemical identification of the MP nature. In this perspective, the recent techniques and instrumentation for MP characterization (Raman and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopies and microscopies, pyrolysis and thermal desorption gas chromatography, imaging techniques, etc.) are discussed including considerations to the multidimensionality of the problem. This perspective also summarizes and provides updated data on the sources and occurrence, transport and fate of MPs in aquatic ecosystems, as well as influencing conditions and factors affecting dispersal.

We surgically isolated ileal segments in 2-3 week old calves, infused antibiotics, and subdivided each segment into three compartments. Following a 6-8 week period the isolated ileal segments appeared grossly normal in 4 of 5 calves, retained compartmentalization, and contents were culture positive for either Enterococcus spp. or Escherichia coli. In a second experiment, isolated ileal segments were examined following a 9-11 month period and appeared grossly normal with compartmentalization retained in 8 of 11 animals. Streptococcus spp or Escherichia coli were cultured from segment contents collected from 3 of these 8 animals. Histology revealed a marked reduction in villus height in isolated ileal segments despite sustained crypt epithelium proliferation. Lymphoid follicles in ileal Peyer's patches were reduced in size but remained sites of active lymphoproliferation within segments. Significant mucosal T cell, macrophage, and dendritic cell depletion was observed in isolated ileal segments and T cell and NK cell depletion increased significantly in the absence of culturable bacteria. Finally, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 expression was decreased but TLR-5 and -6 expression increased in ileal segments. Thus, isolated ileal segments remained relatively stable for prolonged periods and significant changes in mucosal leukocyte populations were correlated with the presence or absence of culturable microflora.

A major concern among professionals is the side branch coverage which leads in some cases to vessel occlusion. However, the lost vessel patency only infrequently is accompanied by a new onset of neurological deficits secondary to ischaemic lesions. A retrospective analysis of all patients treated with flow diversion at our hospital was aimed to better understand this phenomenon in order to formulate a hypothesis about the causes. We concluded that vessel occlusion occurs due to a reduced blood pressure gradient in those vessels with a strong collateral or anastomotic vascularization that refurnishes the same distal vascular territories. Indeed, we detected no new brain infarction since blood flow was always guaranteed.","Hohenstatt, Sophia; Arrichiello, Antonio; Conte, Giorgio; Craparo, Giuseppe; Caranci, Ferdinando; Angileri, Alessio; Levi, Daniel; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo; Paolucci, Aldo",Acta bio-medica : Atenei Parmensis,https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i10-s.10283; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33245072/,447

133168,"""A Tiered-System to Guide Prioritization of Pediatric Cleft and Craniofacial Cases in COVID-19"".",2020-05-29,"IMPORTANCE Many preschool children develop recurrent, severe episodes of lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI). Although viral infections are often present, bacteria may also contribute to illness pathogenesis. Strategies that effectively attenuate such episodes are needed. OBJECTIVE To evaluate if early administration of azithromycin, started prior to the onset of severe LRTI symptoms, in preschool children with recurrent severe LRTIs can prevent the progression of these episodes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted across 9 academic US medical centers in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's AsthmaNet network, with enrollment starting in April 2011 and follow-up complete by December 2014. Participants were 607 children aged 12 through 71 months with histories of recurrent, severe LRTIs and minimal day-to-day impairment. INTERVENTION Participants were randomly assigned to receive azithromycin (12 mg/kg/d for 5 days; n = 307) or matching placebo (n = 300), started early during each predefined RTI (child's signs or symptoms prior to development of LRTI), based on individualized action plans, over a 12- through 18-month period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome measure was the number of RTIs not progressing to a severe LRTI, measured at the level of the RTI, that would in clinical practice trigger the prescription of oral corticosteroids. Presence of azithromycin-resistant organisms in oropharyngeal samples, along with adverse events, were among the secondary outcome measures. RESULTS A total of 937 treated RTIs (azithromycin group, 473; placebo group, 464) were experienced by 443 children (azithromycin group, 223; placebo group, 220), including 92 severe LRTIs (azithromycin group, 35; placebo group, 57). Azithromycin significantly reduced the risk of progressing to severe LRTI relative to placebo (hazard ratio, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.41-0.98], P = .04; absolute risk for first RTI: 0.05 for azithromycin, 0.08 for placebo; risk difference, 0.03 [95% CI, 0.00-0.06]). Induction of azithromycin-resistant organisms and adverse events were infrequently observed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among young children with histories of recurrent severe LRTIs, the use of azithromycin early during an apparent RTI compared with placebo reduced the likelihood of severe LRTI. More information is needed on the development of antibiotic-resistant pathogens with this strategy.

Perioperative local anesthetics are effective analgesics in the immediate 1- to 2-day postoperative period, but acute pain often lasts longer. The goal of this work was to develop a local anesthetic formulation adhering to an intraoperative implanted device that reduces pain for at least 3 days after surgery. METHODS Six groups, each with 8 rats, were studied. In a control group (group I), one 1.2-cm-long incision of the skin was followed by blunt dissection to separate the skin away from the underlying tissues and closing with 2 sutures. In 3 of the treatment groups, the same surgical procedure was used, with the subcutaneous space formed by the blunt dissection lined with a 1-cm square patch of hernia mesh coated with poly lactide co-glycolic acid microspheres containing approximately 17 mg of bupivacaine (group II), no drug (placebo; group III), or bupivacaine free-base powder (group IV). Uncoated mesh implants (group V) served as a secondary control. A standard bupivacaine solution (0.4 mL, 0.5%; 2-mg dose) was infiltrated subcutaneously 30 minutes before the surgery and served as a standard control (group VI). Mechanosensitivity of the skin was tested by the local subcutaneous muscle responses to cutaneous tactile stimulation by von Frey hairs with forces of 4 g (for allodynia) and 15 g (for hyperalgesia) preoperatively and for 7 postoperative days. RESULTS Control rats (group I) showed mechanohypersensitivity, indicative of postoperative allodynia and hyperalgesia, for all 7 postoperative days. Mechanohyperalgesia in rats that received mesh coated with bupivacaine-releasing microspheres (group II) was reduced during this period to 13% of control postoperative values (P < 0.001); mesh coated with bupivacaine base (group IV) reduced it by 50% (P = 0.034). The placebo mesh (group III) and uncoated mesh (group V) caused no significant reduction of mechanohypersensitivity, and bupivacaine solution infiltrated before the incision (group VI) reduced hypersensitivity for only approximately 2 hours, an overall insignificant effect. CONCLUSIONS Bupivacaine slowly released for 72 hours from microspheres adsorbed to the hernia mesh significantly suppresses evoked postoperative hypersensitivity for at least 1 week and is more effective than a suspension of these microspheres or preoperative single-shot infiltration of bupivacaine.","Ohri, Rachit; Wang, Jeffery Chi-Fei; Pham, Lan; Blaskovich, Phillip D; Costa, Daniel; Nichols, Gary; Hildebrand, William; Scarborough, Nelson; Herman, Clifford; Strichartz, Gary R",Regional anesthesia and pain medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/aap.0000000000000062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24513957/,447

137313,Closing the loop on plastic packaging materials: What is quality and how does it affect their circularity?,2018,"INTRODUCTION Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of real-time ultrasound guidance during percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy, including in patients with risk factors such as coagulopathy, cervical spine immobilization and morbid obesity. Use of real-time ultrasound guidance has been shown to improve the technical accuracy of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy; however, it is unclear if there is an associated reduction in complications. Our objective was to determine whether the peri-procedural use of real-time ultrasound guidance is associated with a reduction in complications of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy using a propensity score analysis. METHODS This study reviewed all percutaneous dilatational tracheostomies performed in an 8-year period in a neurocritical care unit. Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomies were typically performed by trainees under guidance of the attending intensivist. Bronchoscopic guidance was used for all procedures with addition of real-time ultrasound guidance at the discretion of the attending physician. Real-time ultrasound guidance was used to guide endotracheal tube withdrawal, guide tracheal puncture, identify guidewire entry level and confirm bilateral lung sliding. The primary outcome was a composite of previously defined complications including (among others) bleeding, infection, loss of airway, inability to complete procedure, need for revision, granuloma and early dislodgement. Propensity score analysis was used to ensure that the relationship of not using real-time ultrasound guidance with the probability of an adverse outcome was examined within groups of patients having similar covariate profiles. Covariates included were age, gender, body mass index, diagnosis, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, timing of tracheostomy, positive end-expiratory pressure and presence of risk factors including coagulopathy, cervical spine immobilization and prior tracheostomy. RESULTS A total of 200 patients underwent percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy during the specified period, and 107 received real-time ultrasound guidance. Risk factors for percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy were present in 63 (32%). There were nine complications in the group without real-time ultrasound guidance: bleeding (n = 4), need for revision related to inability to ventilate or dislodgement (n = 3) and symptomatic granuloma (n = 2). There was one complication in the real-time ultrasound guidance group (early dislodgement). The odds of having an adverse outcome for patients receiving real-time ultrasound guidance were significantly lower (odds ratio = 0.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.009 to 0.811; P = 0.032) than for those receiving a standard technique while holding the propensity score quartile fixed. CONCLUSIONS The use of real-time ultrasound guidance during percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy was associated with a significant reduction in procedure-related complications.","Rajajee, Venkatakrishna; Williamson, Craig A; West, Brady T",Critical care,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-015-0924-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25925262/,447
137638,Skin manifestations reported in association with COVID-19 infection.,2020-12-30,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE T cells play vital roles in the development and progression of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), including cytotoxicity mediated by CD8+ T cells and immunoregulatory activity mediated by CD4+ T cells. Interleukin (IL)-9 secreting CD4+ T cells (Th9 cells) were recently found to be involved in the onset of ACS. PATIENTS AND METHODS we investigated regulatory role of Th9 cells to CD8+ T cells in patients with stable angina pectoris, unstable angina pectoris, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). RESULTS Circulating Th9 cells percentage, plasma IL-9 level, and PU.1 mRNA relative level was up-regulated in AMI patients compared with controls. There was no significant difference of IL-9 secreting CD8+ T cells percentage among groups. CD8+ T cells from AMI patients revealed increased cytotoxicity than those from controls, which presented as enhanced cytotolytic activity to target cells, increased interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α secretion, elevated perforin and granzyme B production, reduced programmed death-1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4. IL-9 stimulation did not affect proliferation, but promoted CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity from both controls and AMI patients. IL-9-secreting CD4+ T cells were enriched in CD4+ CCR4- CCR6- CXCR3- cells. The enhancement of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity induced by CD4+ CCR4- CCR6- CXCR3- cells was dependent on IL-9 secretion. INTERPRETATION The present results indicated that up-regulation of IL-9-secreting CD4+ T cells may contribute to pathogenesis of AMI through enhancement of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity.","Gang, Hongsheng; Peng, Dingfeng; Hu, Yongjun; Tang, Shaoyong; Li, Songhai; Huang, Qing","APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",https://doi.org/10.1111/apm.13094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33113251/,447
139305,Typical Imaging Patterns in COVID-19 Infections of the Lung on Plain Chest Radiographs to Aid Early Triage.,2021-03-10,"Emotion dysregulation has been implicated as a risk factor for many psychiatric conditions. Therefore, examining genetic risk associated with emotion dysregulation could help inform cross-disorder risk more generally. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of emotion dysregulation using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array technology was conducted in a highly traumatized, minority, urban sample (N = 2600, males = 774). Post-hoc analyses examined associations between SNPs identified in the GWAS and current depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and history of suicide attempt. Methylation quantitative trait loci were identified and gene set enrichment analyses were used to broadly determine biological processes involved with these SNPs. Among males, SNP rs6602398, located within the interleukin receptor 2A gene, IL2RA, was significantly associated with emotion dysregulation (p = 1.1 × 10-8). Logistic regression analyses revealed this SNP was significantly associated with depression (Exp(B) = 2.67, p < 0.001) and PTSD (Exp(B) = 2.07, p < 0.01). This SNP was associated with differential DNA methylation (p < 0.05) suggesting it may be functionally active. Finally, through gene set enrichment analyses, ten psychiatric disease pathways (adjusted p < 0.01) and the calcium signaling pathway (adjusted p = 0.008) were significantly associated with emotion dysregulation. We found initial evidence for an association between emotion dysregulation and genetic risk loci that have already been implicated in medical disorders that have high comorbidity with psychiatric disorders. Our results provide further evidence that emotion dysregulation can be understood as a potential psychiatric cross-disorder risk factor, and that sex differences across these phenotypes may be critical. Continued research into genetic and biological risk associated with emotion dysregulation is needed.","Powers, Abigail; Almli, Lynn; Smith, Alicia; Lori, Adriana; Leveille, Jen; Ressler, Kerry J; Jovanovic, Tanja; Bradley, Bekh",Journal of psychiatric research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2016.09.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27643478/,447

Healthcare is and has been a top priority for voters in the U.S., and an important political issue. Consequently, it is important to determine what relationship voting patterns have with health, disease, and mortality, as doing so may help guide appropriate policy. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between voting patterns and over 150 different public health and wellbeing variables at the county level, comparing all states, including counties in 2016 battleground states, and counties in states that flipped from majority Democrat to majority Republican from 2012 to 2016. We also investigated county-level health trends over the last 30+ years and find statistically significant relationships between a number of health measures and the voting patterns of counties in presidential elections. Collectively, these data exhibit a strong pattern: counties that voted Republican in the 2016 election had overall worse health outcomes than those that voted Democrat. We hope that this strong relationship can guide improvements in healthcare policy legislation at the county level.","Hamamsy, Tymor; Danziger, Michael; Nagler, Jonathan; Bonneau, Richard",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34288913/,447

METHODS The institutional review board approved this bi-institutional retrospective study of 85 consecutive surgical candidates with 97 biopsy-proven malignant renal masses (T1a) treated with percutaneous TA from 2008 to 2016. The LTPFS, MFS, CSS and OS rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Descriptive analysis was also performed. RESULTS The median tumour size was 2.3 cm (range, 0.7-3.9 cm). The minimal and mean follow-up periods were 24 and 56 months, respectively. Local recurrence was detected in four patients (4.7%) at 8.5, 13.8, 58.0 and 64.0 months of follow-up and retreated successfully with percutaneous TA. No patient developed metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and none died due to renal oncologic complications. One patient died of heart attack. The 5-year LTPFS, OS, MFS and CSS rates were 93.0%, 98.4%, 100% and 100%, respectively. Only two patients (2.3%) had major complications (Clavien-Dindo grade > II), including ureteropelvic junction stenosis and urinary obstruction due to ureteral blood clots. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates that percutaneous TA is a feasible and effective first-line therapy for healthy surgical candidates with small renal masses (T1a). The 5-year LTPFS, OS, CSS and MFS rates were 93.0%, 98.4%, 100% and 100%, respectively, with a major complication rate of only 2.3%. KEY POINTS • Image-guided percutaneous thermoablation of small renal malignancies was effective in 95.3% of the healthy surgical candidates. • Major complications were detected in 2.3% of the patients. • The local tumour progression-free survival rate was 97.6% and 93.0% at 3 and 5 years, respectively.","Zangiacomo, Renato N; Martins, Guilherme L P; Viana, Públio C C; Horvat, Natally; Arap, Marco A; Nahas, William C; Srougi, Miguel; Cerri, Giovanni G; Menezes, Marcos R",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07496-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33392662/,447

The present analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg versus empagliflozin 25 mg for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy from a healthcare payer perspective in the UK. METHODS Outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects of initiation of once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg were based on an indirect comparison conducted using patient-level data, as there is currently no head-to-head clinical trial comparing these therapies. Modelled patients received treatments until glycated haemoglobin exceeded 7.5% (58 mmol/mol), at which point patients initiated basal insulin. The analysis captured pharmacy costs and costs of diabetes-related complications, expressed in 2019 pounds sterling (GBP). Projected outcomes were discounted at 3.5% annually. Scenario analyses were prepared to assess uncertainty around projected outcomes. RESULTS Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was associated with increases in life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.12 years and 0.23 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively, compared with empagliflozin 25 mg. Projected improvements in quality and duration of life resulted from a reduced cumulative incidence and a delayed time to onset of diabetes-related complications. Once-weekly semaglutide was associated with increased pharmacy costs, but this was partially offset by avoided costs of treating complications. Once-weekly semaglutide was associated with an increase in costs of GBP 1017 per patient, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 4439 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION Once-weekly semaglutide 1 mg was projected to be a cost-effective treatment option from a healthcare payer perspective compared with empagliflozin 25 mg for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK setting.","Capehorn, Matthew; Hallén, Nino; Baker-Knight, James; Glah, Divina; Hunt, Barnaby","Diabetes therapy : research, treatment and education of diabetes and related disorders",https://doi.org/10.1007/s13300-020-00989-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423240/,447

This study examines education changes spurred by COVID-19. METHODS Data were collected via a Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance survey of family medicine clerkship directors. Participants answered questions about didactic and clinical changes made to clerkship teaching due to the COVID-19 pandemic, how positive the changes were, whether the changes would be made permanent, and how prepared clerkship directors were for the changes. RESULTS The response rate was 64%. The most frequent change made to didactic teaching was increasing online resources. The most frequent change made to clinical teaching was adding clinical simulation. Greater changes were made to clinical teaching than to didactic teaching. Changes made to didactic teaching were perceived as more positive for student learning than the changes made to clinical teaching. Clerkship directors felt more prepared for changes to didactic teaching than for clinical teaching, and were more likely to make the didactic teaching changes permanent than the clinical teaching changes. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic caused nearly all clerkship directors to make changes to clerkship teaching, but few felt prepared to make these changes, particularly changes to clinical teaching. Clerkship directors made fewer changes to didactic teaching than clinical teaching, however, didactic changes were perceived as more positive than clinical changes and were more likely to be adopted long term.","Everard, Kelly M; Schiel, Kimberly Zoberi",Family medicine,https://doi.org/10.22454/fammed.2021.583240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33887050/,447

Results: We found that the TT vaccine coverage was 75.32% and that the majority were spread across several provinces. The provinces of Bali and Nusa Tenggara, the richer respondents, living in a rural area, visiting the health facility, having health insurance, and those currently working were factors making it more likely that the women would receive the TT vaccine. The respondents aged 15-24 years with a primary education level and the respondents who were divorced were less likely to receive the TT vaccine. Conclusion: The coverage of the TT vaccine among women can be increased by considering the regional disparities in Indonesia and the socio-economic demographic details of the respondents. Strengthening the policies from the central government in the local governments can improve the screening process and vaccine delivery outcomes. In addition, the importance of giving the TT vaccine to women needs to be relayed through health education in collaboration between health workers and the public.","Arifin, Hidayat; Widiasih, Restuning; Pradipta, Rifky Octavia; Kurniawati, Yulia",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.53004.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34457242/,447

We conducted an evaluation of CoV in rhinolophid and vespertilionid bat species common in Europe. Rhinolophids carried severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related CoV at high frequencies and concentrations (26% of animals are positive; up to 2.4×10(8) copies per gram of feces), as well as two Alphacoronavirus clades, one novel and one related to the HKU2 clade. All three clades present in Miniopterus bats in China (HKU7, HKU8, and 1A related) were also present in European Miniopterus bats. An additional novel Alphacoronavirus clade (bat CoV [BtCoV]/BNM98-30) was detected in Nyctalus leisleri. A CoV grouping criterion was developed by comparing amino acid identities across an 816-bp fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) of all accepted mammalian CoV species (RdRp-based grouping units [RGU]). Criteria for defining separate RGU in mammalian CoV were a >4.8% amino acid distance for alphacoronaviruses and a >6.3% distance for betacoronaviruses. All the above-mentioned novel clades represented independent RGU. Strict associations between CoV RGU and host bat genera were confirmed for six independent RGU represented simultaneously in China and Europe. A SARS-related virus (BtCoV/BM48-31/Bulgaria/2008) from a Rhinolophus blasii (Rhi bla) bat was fully sequenced. It is predicted that proteins 3b and 6 were highly divergent from those proteins in all known SARS-related CoV. Open reading frame 8 (ORF8) was surprisingly absent. Surface expression of spike and staining with sera of SARS survivors suggested low antigenic overlap with SARS CoV. However, the receptor binding domain of SARS CoV showed higher similarity with that of BtCoV/BM48-31/Bulgaria/2008 than with that of any Chinese bat-borne CoV. Critical spike domains 472 and 487 were identical and similar, respectively. This study underlines the importance of assessments of the zoonotic potential of widely distributed bat-borne CoV.","Drexler, Jan Felix; Gloza-Rausch, Florian; Glende, Jörg; Corman, Victor Max; Muth, Doreen; Goettsche, Matthias; Seebens, Antje; Niedrig, Matthias; Pfefferle, Susanne; Yordanov, Stoian; Zhelyazkov, Lyubomir; Hermanns, Uwe; Vallo, Peter; Lukashev, Alexander; Müller, Marcel Alexander; Deng, Hongkui; Herrler, Georg; Drosten, Christian",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00650-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20686038/,447

This observational cohort study compared outcomes between elective colectomy and non-operative management following admission for an initial acute diverticular abscess. METHODS The Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System was queried for unscheduled admissions for an initial acute diverticular abscess in 2002-2010. Bivariable and propensity-matched multivariable analyses compared stoma rates and use of healthcare in patients who had an elective resection and those receiving non-operative management. Diverticulitis recurrence rates were analysed for non-operative management. RESULTS Among 10 342 patients with an initial acute diverticular abscess, one-third (3270) underwent surgical intervention within 30 days despite initial non-operative management. Of the remaining 7072 patients, 1660 had an elective colectomy within 6 months. Of 5412 patients receiving non-operative management, 1340 (24·8 per cent) had recurrence of diverticulitis within 5 years (median 278 (i.q.r. 93·5-707) days to recurrence). Elective colectomy was associated with higher stoma rates (10·0 per cent, compared with 5·7 per cent for non-operative observation, P < 0·001; odds ratio 1·88, 95 per cent c.i. 1·50 to 2·36), as well as more inpatient hospital days for diverticulitis-related admissions (mean 8·0 versus 4·6 days respectively, P < 0·001; incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2·16, 95 per cent c.i. 1·89 to 2·47) and higher mean diverticulitis-related cost (€70 107 versus €24 490, P < 0·001; IRR 3·11, 2·42 to 4·01). CONCLUSION Observation without elective colectomy following resolution of an initial diverticular abscess is a reasonable option with lower healthcare costs than operation.","Aquina, C T; Becerra, A Z; Xu, Z; Justiniano, C F; Noyes, K; Monson, J R T; Fleming, F J",The British journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.10982; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30335195/,447

In addition, we wanted to analyse the effect of defect closure and mesh fixation techniques. METHODS 37 patients with PH and 70 with IH were enrolled in a prospective cohort-study, treated with laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) and randomised to ± transfascial sutures. In addition, we analysed results from a retrospective study with 36 PH and 51 IH patients. Mean follow-up time was 38 months in the prospective study and 27 months in the retrospective study. RESULTS 35 % of PH's and 10 % of IH's were recurrences after previous suture repair. No late infections or mesh removals occurred. Recurrence rates in the prospective study were 0 vs. 4.3 % (p = 0.55) and the complication rates were 16 vs. 27 % (p = 0.24) in favour of the PH cohort. The IH group had a mesh protrusion rate of 13 vs. 5 % in the PH group (p = 0.32), and significantly (p < 0.01) larger hernias and adhesion score, longer operating time (100 vs. 79 min) and admission time (2.8 vs. 1.6 days). Closure of the hernia defect did not influence rate of seroma, pain at 2 months, protrusion or recurrence. An overall increased complication rate was seen after defect closure (OR 3.42; CI 1.25-9.33). CONCLUSIONS With PH, in comparison to IH treated with LVHR, no differences were observed regarding recurrence, protrusion or complication rates. Defect closure (raphe), when using absorbable suture, did not benefit long-term outcomes and caused a higher overall complication rate.

HYPOTHESIS Carpal joint hyperextension during axial limb loading during the middle of stance disproportionately enhances SDFT strains compared to suspensory ligament (SL) strains. METHODS Superficial digital flexor tendon and SL strains were measured in 7 cadaver limbs during in vitro loading that maintained carpal extension or allowed carpal hyperextension by constraining, or allowing rotation of, the radius during loading conditions that simulated the middle of stance at the walk. The effect of carpal hyperextension on SDFT and SL strains and joint angles was assessed using repeated measures ANOVA. RESULTS Limb loading generally resulted in higher SL strains than SDFT strains for both carpal extension and hyperextension loading conditions. Compared to carpal extension, carpal hyperextension resulted in increased strains in both the SDFT and the SL; however, a greater increase in strain was seen in the SDFT. On average, carpal hyperextension caused approximately 3° greater carpal extension, 1° greater metacarpophalangeal joint hyperextension, 1° greater proximal interphalangeal joint flexion and <1° greater distal interphalangeal joint flexion than did carpal extension. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Carpal joint hyperextension is likely to induce disproportionately higher strain in the SDFT than in the SL. Factors that affect carpal stability are likely to affect the risk for superficial digital flexor tendinopathy.","Whitlock, D; Garcia, T C; Vallance, S A; Stover, S M",Equine veterinary journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2042-3306.2011.00466.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21880065/,447

The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not foregoing routine tissue biopsy increased the incidence of lobectomy for benign lesions. METHODS Retrospective cohort of 256 patients who underwent thoracoscopic or open lobectomy for a confirmed or suspected pulmonary malignancy, with or without tissue diagnosis. Clinical, radiographic, and pathologic data were compared. RESULTS Among 256 patients, 127 had attempted biopsy (group A) and 129 had no biopsy procedure (group B). There was no significant difference in the incidence of benign resections between the groups (Group A = 4 (3.2%) benign pathology vs group B = 9 (7.0%; P = 0.16). Group B had significantly lower operative time (127.1 vs 112.3 minutes; P = 0.004) and intraoperative complications (23 vs 37 patients; P = 0.03). There was a trend toward longer hospital stay and surgical waiting time in group A (6.6 vs 5.2 days, P = 0.24; 92.4 vs 66.2 days; P = 0.14, respectively). CONCLUSION Foregoing biopsies and proceeding to lobectomy in selected patients with suspicious lung nodules is safe, did not increase the incidence of resected benign pathology, and may decrease surgical wait time. Patients should be carefully evaluated and counseled.","Kaaki, Suha; Kidane, Biniam; Srinathan, Sadeesh; Tan, Lawrence; Buduhan, Gordon",Journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jso.25003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29473958/,447

Recently the need to limit patient and provider exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has escalated implementation of telehealth across the globe. As telehealth utilization expands, its role in nursing education and training requires systematic evaluation. Since publication of the National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculty white paper supporting telehealth in health care delivery and nurse practitioner education, several studies have demonstrated successful didactic instruction and training in telehealth. However, a recent literature review found no studies evaluating the use of telehealth technology as a means of precepting in clinical training. METHODS This small-scale qualitative study investigates the readiness of one behavioral health clinic to provide teleprecepting to psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner students. Two preceptors and one student were interviewed using a peer-reviewed semistructured interview guide using video chat. Responses were reviewed, coded, and categorized into themes. RESULTS Thematic analysis of the interviews revealed three categories for consideration in establishing teleprecepting. Clinical factors, logistics, and comparison with traditional precepting are discussed. Interviewees viewed teleprecepting as a viable method of increasing access to clinical training. CONCLUSIONS This project supports teleprecepting as a feasible strategy for improving access to clinical training and as a technological resource that merits systematic evaluation. Practice guidelines are needed for teleprecepting of advanced practice registered nurse students, and both preceptors and students may benefit from training to support best practices prior to implementation.","Johnson, Deborah S; Ling, Amanda; Melino, Katerina",Journal of the American Psychiatric Nurses Association,https://doi.org/10.1177/1078390320948127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32772880/,447

To assess the effects of macromolecular crowding on unfolding of an oligomeric protein, we here tested the effects of the synthetic crowding agent Ficoll 70 on human cpn10 (GroES in E. coli), a heptameric protein consisting of seven identical β-barrel subunits assembling into a ring. Using far-UV circular dichroism (CD), tyrosine fluorescence, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and cross-linking experiments, we investigated thermal and chemical stability, as well as the heptamer-monomer dissociation constant, without and with crowding agent. We find that crowding shifts the heptamer-monomer equilibrium constant in the direction of the heptamer. The cpn10 heptamer is both thermally and thermodynamically stabilized in 300 mg/mL Ficoll 70 as compared to regular buffer conditions. Kinetic unfolding experiments show that the increased stability in crowded conditions, in part, is explained by slower unfolding rates. A thermodynamic cycle reveals that in presence of 300 mg/mL Ficoll the thermodynamic stability of each cpn10 monomer increases by over 30%, whereas the interfaces are stabilized by less than 10%. We also introduce a new approach to analyze the spectroscopic data that makes use of multiple wavelengths: this provides robust error estimates of thermodynamic parameters.","Aguilar, Ximena; F Weise, Christoph; Sparrman, Tobias; Wolf-Watz, Magnus; Wittung-Stafshede, Pernilla",Biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/bi2002086; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21375247/,447

168951,Protein Structure and Function Prediction of SARS-CoV 2: Prospective Antivirus Active Drug Binding Sites,2021,"Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia despite the widespread use of vaccines. While vaccines are effective at reducing the incidence of most vaccine-included serotypes, a rise in infection due to non-vaccine serotypes, and moderate efficacy against some vaccine included serotypes have contributed to high disease incidence. Additionally, numerous isolates of S. pneumoniae are antibiotic or multi-drug resistant. Several conserved pneumococcal proteins prevalent in the majority of serotypes have been examined as vaccines in preclinical and clinical trials. An additional, yet unexplored tool for disease prevention and treatment is the use of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting conserved pneumococcal proteins. Here, we isolate the first human mAbs (PhtD3, PhtD6, PhtD7, PhtD8, PspA16) against the pneumococcal histidine triad protein (PhtD), and the pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), two conserved and protective antigens. mAbs to PhtD target diverse epitopes on PhtD, and mAb PspA16 targets the N-terminal segment of PspA. The PhtD-specific mAbs bind to multiple serotypes, while mAb PspA16 serotype breadth is limited. mAbs PhtD3 and PhtD8 prolong the survival of mice infected with pneumococcal serotype 3. Furthermore, mAb PhtD3 prolongs the survival of mice in intranasal and intravenous infection models with pneumococcal serotype 4, and in mice infected with pneumococcal serotype 3 when administered 24 hours after pneumococcal infection. All PhtD and PspA mAbs demonstrate opsonophagocytic activity, suggesting a potential mechanism of protection. Our results provide new human mAbs for pneumococcal disease prevention and treatment, and identify epitopes on PhtD and PspA recognized by human B cells.","Huang, Jiachen; Gingerich, Aaron D.; Royer, Fredejah; Paschall, Amy V.; Pena-Briseno, Alma; Avci, Fikri Y.; Mousa, Jarrod J.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.17.431651,447
169693,COVID-19 Restrictions Presented Opportunities and Challenges for Plastic Surgery Residents,2021,"COVID-19 is a community-acquired infection with symptoms that resemble those of influenza and bacterial pneumonia. Creating an infection control policy involving isolation, disinfection of surfaces, and identification of contagions is crucial in eradicating such pandemics. Incorporating social distancing could also help stop the spread of community-acquired infections like COVID-19. Social distancing entails maintaining certain distances between people and reducing the frequency of contact between people. Meanwhile, a significant increase in the development of different Internet of Things (IoT) devices has been seen together with cyber-physical systems that connect with physical environments. Machine learning is strengthening current technologies by adding new approaches to quickly and correctly solve problems utilizing this surge of available IoT devices. We propose a new approach using machine learning algorithms for monitoring the risk of COVID-19 in public areas. Extracted features from IoT sensors are used as input for several machine learning algorithms such as decision tree, neural network, naïve Bayes classifier, support vector machine, and random forest to predict the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic and calculate the risk probability of public places. This research aims to find vulnerable populations and reduce the impact of the disease on certain groups using machine learning models. We build a model to calculate and predict the risk factors of populated areas. This model generates automated alerts for security authorities in the case of any abnormal detection. Experimental results show that we have high accuracy with random forest of 97.32%, with decision tree of 94.50%, and with the naïve Bayes classifier of 99.37%.

Despite its reversibility, it is associated with serious adverse in-hospital events and high complication rates during follow-up. Multimodality imaging is helpful for establishing the diagnosis, guiding therapy, and stratifying prognosis of TTS patients in both the acute and post-acute phase. Echocardiography plays a key role, particularly in the acute care setting, allowing for the assessment of left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function and the identification of the typical apical-midventricular ballooning pattern, as well as the circumferential pattern of wall motion abnormalities. It is also useful in the early detection of complications (i.e. LV outflow tract obstruction, mitral regurgitation, right ventricular involvement, LV thrombi, and pericardial effusion) and monitoring of systolic function recovery. Left ventriculography allows the evaluation of LV function and morphology, identifying the typical TTS patterns when echocardiography is not available or wall motion abnormalities cannot be properly assessed with ultrasound. Cardiac magnetic resonance provides a more comprehensive depiction of cardiac morphology and function and tissue characterization and offers additional value to other imaging modalities for differential diagnosis (myocardial infarction and myocarditis). Coronary computed tomography angiography has a substantial role in the diagnostic workup of patients with acute chest pain and a doubtful TTS diagnosis to rule out other medical conditions. It can be considered as a non-invasive appropriate alternative to coronary angiography in several clinical scenarios. Although the role of nuclear imaging in TTS has not yet been well established, the combination of perfusion and metabolic imaging may provide useful information on myocardial function in both the acute and post-acute phase.","Citro Chair, Rodolfo; Okura Co-Chair, Hiroyuki; Ghadri, Jelena R; Izumi, Chisato; Meimoun, Patrick; Izumo, Masaki; Dawson, Dana; Kaji, Shuichiro; Eitel, Ingo; Kagiyama, Nobuyuki; Kobayashi, Yukari; Templin, Christian; Delgado, Victoria; Nakatani, Satoshi; Popescu, Bogdan A",,,447

Findings 682 residents from 86 LCTFs and 1429 staff members from 97 LTCFs met study inclusion criteria. At baseline, IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid were detected in 226 (33%) of 682 residents and 408 (29%) of 1429 staff members. 93 (20%) of 456 residents who were antibody-negative at baseline had a PCR-positive test (infection rate 0·054 per month at risk) compared with four (2%) of 226 residents who were antibody-positive at baseline (0·007 per month at risk). 111 (11%) of 1021 staff members who were antibody-negative at baseline had PCR-positive tests (0·042 per month at risk) compared with ten (2%) of 408 staff members who were antibody-positive staff at baseline (0·009 per month at risk). The risk of PCR-positive infection was higher for residents who were antibody-negative at baseline than residents who were antibody-positive at baseline (adjusted HR [aHR] 0·15, 95% CI 0·05–0·44, p=0·0006), and the risk of a PCR-positive infection was also higher for staff who were antibody-negative at baseline compared with staff who were antibody-positive at baseline (aHR 0·39, 0·19–0·82;p=0·012). 12 of 14 reinfected participants had available data on symptoms, and 11 of these participants were symptomatic. Antibody titres to spike and nucleocapsid proteins were comparable in PCR-positive and PCR-negative cases. Interpretation The presence of IgG antibodies to nucleocapsid protein was associated with substantially reduced risk of reinfection in staff and residents for up to 10 months after primary infection.

212388,Modeling the occurrence of events subject to a reporting delay via an EM algorithm,2019-09-18,"To date the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2), known as COVID-19, is for clinicians the most difficult global therapeutic problem. In this landscape, the management of patients with chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury or patients undergoing immunosuppressant therapies for kidney transplant or glomerular diseases, represent a clinical challenge for nephrologists, especially in patients with severe acute lung involvement. Therefore in this setting, due to the lack of anti-COVID treatment schedules, tailored management is mandatory to reduce the side effects, as consequence of impaired renal function and drugs interactions. We report the main treatment actually used against SARS-CoV-2, underlining its possible use in the nephropatic patients and the central role of nephrologists to improve the clinical outcome.","Roberto, Palumbo; Francesco, Londrino; Emanuela, Cordova; Giorgia, Gambardella; Pasquale, Niscola; Sara, Dominijanni",Intern Emerg Med,,447
214084,[Intensive care back up for infectious disease disasters],2020,"OBJECTIVE: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has currently ravaged through the world, resulting in over thirteen million confirmed cases and over five hundred thousand deaths, a complete change in daily life as we know it, worldwide lockdowns, travel restrictions, as well as heightened hygiene measures and physical distancing. Being able to analyse and predict the spread of this epidemic-causing disease is hence of utmost importance now, especially as it would help in the reasoning behind important decisions drastically affecting countries and their people, as well as in ensuring efficient resource and utility management. However, the needs of the people and specific conditions of the spread are varying widely from country to country. Hence, this article has two fold objectives: (i) conduct an in-depth statistical analysis of COVID-19 affected patients in India, (ii) propose a mathematical model for the prediction of spread of COVID-19 cases in India. MATERIALS AND METHOD: There has been limited research in modeling and predicting the spread of COVID-19 in India, owing both to the ongoing nature of the pandemic and limited availability of data. Currently famous SIR and non-SIR based Gauss-error-function and Monte Carlo simulation models do not perform well in the context of COVID-19 spread in India. We propose a 'change-factor' or 'rate-of-change' based mathematical model to predict the spread of the pandemic in India, with data drawn from hundreds of sources. RESULTS: Average age of affected patients was found to be 38.54 years, with 66.76% males, and 33.24% females. Most patients were in the age range of 18-40 years. Optimal parameter values of the prediction model are identified (&#945;â¯=â¯1.35, Nâ¯=â¯3 and Tâ¯=â¯10) by extensive experiments. Over the entire course of time since the outbreak started in India, the model has been 90.36% accurate in predicting the total number of cases the next day, correctly predicting the range in 150 out of the 166 days looked at. CONCLUSION: The proposed system showed an accuracy of 90.36% for prediction since the first COVID-19 case in India, and 96.67% accuracy over the month of April. Predicted number of cases for the next day is found to be a function of the numbers over the last 3 days, but with an 'increase' factor influenced by the last 10 days. It is noticed that males are affected more than females. It is also noticed that in India, the number of people in each age bucket is steadily decreasing, with the largest number of adults infected being the youngest ones-a departure from the world trend. The model is self-correcting as it improves its predictions every day, by incorporating the previous day's data into the trend-line for the following days. This model can thus be used dynamically not only to predict the spread of COVID-19 in India, but also to check the effect of various government measures in a short span of time after they are implemented.","Ghosh, Shinjini",Int J Med Inform,,447

HYPOTHESIS: Addition of imatinib to the BCC will provide a superior clinical outcome for patients with COVID-19 compared with BCC plus placebo. This hypothesis is on the basis of 1) intralysosomal entrapment of imatinib will increase endosomal pH and effectively decrease SARS-CoV-2/cell fusion, 2) kinase inhibitory activity of imatinib will interfere with budding/release or replication of SARS-CoV-2, and 3) because of the critical role of mechanical ventilation in the care of patients with ARDS, imatinib will have a significant clinical impact for patients with critical COVID-19 infection in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). TRIAL DESIGN: This is an individual patient-level randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-parallel arm phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of imatinib for the treatment of hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Participants will be followed for up to 60 days from the start of study drug administration. This trial will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization. PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion Criteria: Patients may be included in the study only if they meet all of the following criteria: 1) Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Informed consent must be obtained prior to participation in the study. For patients who are too unwell to provide consent such as patients on invasive ventilator or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), their Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) can sign the informed consent, 2) Hospitalized patients &#8805;18 years of age, 3) Positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2 in the respiratory tract sample (oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)) by Center for Disease Control or local laboratory within 7 days of randomization, 4) Women of childbearing potential must agree to use at least one primary form of contraception for the duration of the study. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients meeting any of the following criteria are not eligible for the study: 1) Patients receiving any other investigational agents in a clinical trial. Off-label use of agents such as hydroxychloroquine is not an exclusion criterion, 2) Pregnant or breastfeeding women, 3) Patients with significant liver or renal dysfunction at the time of screening as defined as: 3.1) Direct bilirubin >2.5 mg/dL, 3.2) AST, ALT, or alkaline phosphatase >5x upper limit of normal, 3.3) eGFR &#8804;30 mL/min or requiring renal replacement therapy, 4) Patients with significant hematologic disorder at screen as defined as: 4.1) Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <500/µL, 4.2) Platelet <20,000/µL, 4.3) Hemoglobin <7 g/dL, 5) Uncontrolled underlying illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled active seizure disorder, or psychiatric illness/social situations that per site Principal Investigator's judgment would limit compliance with study requirements, 6) Known allergy to imatinib or its component products, 7) Any other clinical conditions that in the opinion of the investigator would make the subject unsuitable for the study. Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial. University of Maryland Medical Center, Baltimore, MD is the initiating site. The study may be opened in other centers on the basis of the accrual rate or the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Imatinib: All doses of imatinib should be administered with a meal and a large glass of water. Imatinib can be dissolved in water or apple juice for patients having difficulty swallowing. In this study, patients with confirmed positive COVID-19 tests receive imatinib for a total of 14 days; 400 mg orally daily Days 1-14. Imatinib 400 mg tablets will be encapsulated using size 000 capsules and cellulose microcrystalline filler. For patients on ventilator or ECMO, imatinib will be given as oral suspension (40 mg/mL). To make the oral suspension, imatinib tablets will be crushed and mixed in Ora-sweet solution to yield a concentration of 40 mg/mL suspension by pharmacy. Additionally, in the absence of supportive microbiological testing results, we confirm that the in-use stability period for the prepared imatinib suspensions will be 24 hours at room temperature or 7 days at refrigerated conditions. The pharmacy staff will follow the American Society Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) guidelines for handling hazardous drugs. Placebo: The matching placebo will be packaged by Investigational Drug Service Pharmacy at University of Maryland Medical Center. The placebos will be prepared using size 000 capsules and cellulose microcrystalline filler. Imatinib 400 mg capsules and placebo capsules will be identical form and color. For patients on ventilator or ECMO, placebo will be given as oral suspension with similar process for making imatinib suspension. Concomitant Medications/supportive care: In both arms, patients can receive concomitant available local standard of care antipyretics, antibacterials, antivirals, antifungals and anti-inflammatory including hydroxychloroquine at the discretion of the treating physician as necessary. For other drug-drug interactions particularly with CYP P450, the treating physician should consider the risk and benefit of drug administration based on available information. Co-administration of off-label immunomodulatory treatments for COVID-19 including but not limited to corticosteroids, sarilumab, clazakizumab, tocilizumab, and anakinra will be allowed but may affect interpretability of study outcomes. The timing, dosing, and duration of these treatments will be meticulously collected, including any of these treatments that may be used for participants who experience progression of COVID-19 disease after study enrollment. Two analyses will be performed, the primary analysis will compare the primary endpoint in the two trial arms irrespective of any other treatment; the second analysis will be stratified for co-administration of immunomodulatory drugs. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with a two-point improvement at Day 14 from baseline using the 8-category ordinal scale. The ordinal scale is an evaluation of the clinical status at the first assessment of a given study day. The scale is as follows: 1) Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities; 2) Not hospitalized, limitation on activities and/or requiring home oxygen; 3) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - no longer requires ongoing medical care; 4) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen - requiring ongoing medical care (COVID-19 related or otherwise); 5) Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 6) Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; 7) Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO; 8) Death. The secondary endpoints include: All-cause mortality at Day 28, All-cause mortality at Day 60, Time to a 2-point clinical improvement difference over baseline, Duration of hospitalization, Duration of ECMO or invasive mechanical ventilation (for subjects who are on ECMO or mechanical ventilation at Day 1), Duration of ICU stay (for subjects who are in ICU at Day 1), Time to SARS-CoV-2 negative by RT-PCR, Proportion of patients with negative oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR on days 5, 10, 14, 21, and 28 after starting treatment, Proportion of subjects with serious adverse events, Proportion of subjects who discontinue study drug due to adverse events. The exploratory endpoints include: Determine the impact of treatment arms on IL-6 levels, Obtain blood/peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for storage to look at transcriptomics in severe disease, Association of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) with severity of illness, Mean change in the ordinal scale from baseline, Time to an improvement of one category from admission using an ordinal scale, Duration of hospitalization, Duration of new oxygen use, Number of oxygenation free days, Duration of new mechanical ventilation, Number of ventilator free days. RANDOMIZATION: Eligible patients will be uniformly randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either imatinib or placebo for 14 days. Both groups will receive the BCC. The randomized treatment allocations use stratified, permuted block randomization with a variable block size; blocks are generated using a validated random number generator. In order to balance the severity of the respiratory illness between the two arms, randomization will be stratified based on radiographic findings and oxygen requirements: 1) Severe disease: evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray or CT scan OR chest auscultation (rales, crackles), and SpO2 &#8804;92% on ambient air or PaO2/FiO2 <300 mmHg, and requires supplemental oxygen administration by nasal cannula, simple face mask, or other similar oxygen delivery device; 2) Critical disease: requires supplemental oxygen delivered by non-rebreather mask or high flow cannula OR use of invasive or non-invasive ventilation OR requiring treatment in an intensive care unit, use of vasopressors, extracorporeal life support, or renal replacement therapy. BLINDING (MASKING): The participants, caregivers, and the statistician are blinded to group assignment. The only people who are not blinded are Site Pharmacists. Blinding will be performed via a specific randomization process. Centralized, concealed randomization will be executed by the Primary Site's Pharmacist. Data on eligible consented cases will be submittedelectronically on the appropriate on-study form to the pharmacy, where the patient is randomized to imatinib or placebo. Imatinib 400 mg capsules and placebo capsules will be identical form and color. For patients on ventilator or ECMO, placebo will be given as oral suspension with similar process for making imatinib suspension. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMIZED (SAMPLE SIZE): The trial is designed as a double-blind, two-parallel arm, randomized controlled trial with a uniform (1:1) allocation ratio to: Arm A) Imatinib or Arm B) Placebo. Patients in both arms will receive the BCC per local institutional standards at the discretion of the treating physician. Group sample sizes of 102 in Arm A and 102 in Arm B achieve 80.6% power to detect a difference between the group proportions of 0.20. The proportion in Arm A (imatinib treatment arm) is assumed to be 0.30 under the null hypothesis and 0.50 under the alternative hypothesis. The proportion in Arm B (placebo control arm) is 0.30. The test statistic used is the two-sided Fisher's Exact Test. The significance level of the test is targeted at 0.05. The significance level actually achieved by this design is &#945;=0.0385. The power of the test is calculated using binomial enumeration of all possible outcomes. The primary analysis will be conducted using an intention to treat principle (ITT) for participants who at least receive one dose of study drug or placebo. The sample size is not inflated for dropouts. All patients will be evaluable irrespective of the clinical course of their disease. TRIAL STATUS: Current protocol version is 1.2 from May 8, 2020. The recruitment started on June 15, 2020 and is ongoing. We originally anticipated that the trial would finish recruitment by mid 2021. We are aware of the enrollment requirement of approximately 200 patients, which is required to provide scientific integrity of the results. We are also aware of the fact that enrolling this number of patients in a single-site at University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) may take longer than expected, particularly taken into account other competing studies. For this reason, we are actively considering opening the protocol in other sites. After identification of other sites, we will fulfill all regulatory requirements before opening the protocol in other sites. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04394416 .

However, conventional solvent extraction involves the excessive use of organic solvents, costly equipment, and tedious operation. These limitations of conventional extraction methods could be prospectively overcome by the carotenoid-pectin hydrocolloidal complexation. The complexation of lycopene and pectin was efficiently promoted in an aqueous environment, resulting in the colloidal complexes that can be subsequently recovered by sedimentation or centrifugation. In this study, the potential of carotenoid-pectin complexation on tomato pomace containing carotenoids and pectin was evaluated. Tomato pomace is a rich source of lycopene, ß-carotene as well as pectin, making it suitable as the raw material for the carotenoid extraction. The extraction of carotenoid and pectin from tomato pomace was optimized using response surface methodology. The maximum recovery was 9.43 mg carotenoid fractions/100 g tomato pomace, while the purity of carotenoid-rich fractions was 92%. The antioxidant capacity of carotenoids extracted from the complexation method was found to be higher than that from the solvent extraction method. Moreover, extraction yield and antioxidant capacity of carotenoid obtained from the carotenoid-pectin complexation were comparable to that from solvent extraction. The carotenoid-pectin complexation is a promising green approach to valorize agro by-products for the extraction of valuable carotenoids.","Nagarajan, Jayesree; Pui Kay, Hang; Krishnamurthy, Nagendra Prasad; Ramakrishnan, Nagasundara Ramanan; Aldawoud, Turki M S; Galanakis, Charis M; Wei, Ooi Chien",Biomolecules,,447

241024,Commentary on: Insta-Grated Plastic Surgery Residencies: 2020 Update,2021,"Vehicle detection from satellite imagery can support different applications, such as security and situational awareness. In the civilian domain, it can provide quantitative evidence to investigate urban mobility and traffic patterns in cities. Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can help in detecting vehicles in (almost) all weather conditions and during the day and night. In this study, the capability of SAR StripMap imaging mode data to monitor traffic is analyzed using the case study of Wuhan, China. In ordinary times, the bridges crossing the Yangtze river are the key infrastructure allowing for urban mobility inWuhan. More recently, the city has been the first in the world to be put in lockdown due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Using a very long time series of 294 COSMO-SkyMed StripMap HIMAGE mode scenes collected from 2011 to 2020, we detected vehicles on seven bridges, estimated their speed, and analyzed the traffic pattern over time. Vehicles are detected based on their azimuth shift caused by their across-track motion. Our goal is to monitor the variations in traffic instead of single-car detection. The results from 2011 to 2019 show a general increase in the number of vehicles crossing the bridges, as new infrastructure was built over the years. Variations in detected vehicle numbers were especially found during the two events of the 7th International Military Sports Council (CISM) Military World Games in October 2019, and the COVID-19 lockdown in early 2020. These events were therefore used for internal validation of our assessment of traffic patterns. On the other side, TomTom traffic index data were used for external validation. The results and their comparison with TomTom data prove the effectiveness of our method in detecting traffic patterns, but also demonstrate that mostly large vehicles (e.g., trucks or buses) are detected. Future work should be carried out to improve the detection rate of smaller vehicles.","Tanveer, Hashir; Balz, Timo; Cigna, Francesca; Tapete, Deodato",Remote Sens.,,447

The aim of this review is to explore the literature, summarize potential predisposing factors to secondary infections and their incidence. It also summarizes a variety of healthcare scenarios in which different kinds of secondary infections occur. RECENT FINDINGS: Apart from immune dysregulation, severe resource limitations in healthcare settings have made COVID-19 units conducive to a variety of secondary infections. Long-term effect of excess antibiotic use in COVID-19 patients is yet to be studied. Very few studies have assessed secondary infections as the primary outcome measure making it difficult to know the true incidence. Mortality attributable to secondary infections in COVID-19 patients is also unclear. SUMMARY: Incidence of secondary infections in COVID-19 patients is likely higher than what is reported in the literature. Well designed studies are needed to understand the incidence and impact of secondary infections in this patient population. Many of these may be preventable especially now, as personal protective equipment and other healthcare resources are recovering. Infection prevention and control (IPC) and antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASP) must reassess current situation to correct any breaches that could potentially cause more harm in these already vulnerable patients as we brace for a future surge with another pandemic wave.","Sopirala, Madhuri M",Curr Opin Infect Dis,,447

259880,Was bedeutet Ganzheit in der Medizin?,2020,"Cambodia has made impressive progress in reducing malaria trends and, in 2018, reported no malaria-related deaths for the first time. However, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents a potential challenge to the country's goal for malaria elimination by 2025. The path toward malaria elimination depends on sustained interventions to prevent rapid resurgence, which can quickly set back any gains achieved.Malaria Consortium supported mobile malaria workers (MMWs) to engage with target communities to build acceptance, trust, and resilience. At the start of the pandemic, Malaria Consortium conducted a COVID-19 risk assessment and quickly developed and implemented a mitigation plan to ensure MMWs were able to continue providing malaria services without putting themselves or their patients at risk. Changes in malaria intervention coverage and community uptake have been monitored to gauge the indirect effects of COVID-19. Comparisons have been made between output indicators reported in 2020 and from the same month-period of the previous year.In general, malaria service intervention coverage and utilization rates did not decline in 2020. Rather, the reported figures show there was a substantial increase in service utilization. Preliminary internal reviews and community meetings show that despite a heightened public risk perception toward COVID-19, malaria testing motivation has been well sustained throughout the pandemic. This may be attributable to proactive program planning and data monitoring and active engagement with the communities and the national authorities to circumvent the indirect effect of COVID-19 on intervention coverage in Cambodia during the pandemic.","Feldman, Mitra; Vernaeve, Lieven; Tibenderana, James; Braack, Leo; Debackere, Mark; Thu, Htin Kyaw; Hamade, Prudence; Lo, Koung",Glob. health sci. pract,,447

263990,Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients Perceptions of Safety and Need for Elective Foot and Ankle Surgery in the United States,2020,"Abstract Acute cardiac injury is associated with higher mortality in patients with the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and the exact etiology can be challenging to diagnose in the emergency setting during the pandemic. From a pathophysiological perspective, SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha) that leads to systemic inflammation and consequent increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) caused by atheromatous plaque rupture and significant myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 tropism to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system through the ACE2 receptor induces myocarditis that may rapidly progress to left ventricular dysfunction and hemodynamic instability. Myocardial inflammation with pericardial involvement, i.e. , myopericarditis, can progress to cardiac tamponade and obstructive shock. These cardiovascular complications, which are associated with a worse prognosis and higher mortality, can be associated with clinical manifestations, electrocardiographic changes, and troponin values similar to AMI. Thus, the diagnosis and treatment of patients with acute chest pain and dyspnea admitted to the emergency department is a significant challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we provide a review of the literature focusing on a practical approach to acute coronary syndrome patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.","Azevedo, Rafael Bellotti; Botelho, Bruna Gopp; Hollanda, João Victor Gonçalves de; Ferreira, Leonardo Villa Leão; Andrade, Letícia Zarur Junqueira de; Oei, Stephanie Si Min Lilienwald; Mello, Tomás de Souza; Muxfeldt, Elizabeth Silaid",Int. j. cardiovasc. sci.

The result of this pandemic is a large and increasing number of patients requiring endotracheal intubation and prolonged ventilator support. The rapid rise in endotracheal intubations coupled with prolonged ventilation requirements will certainly lead to an increase in tracheostomy procedures in the coming weeks and months. Performing tracheostomy in the setting of active SARS-CoV-2, when necessary, poses a unique situation, with unique risks and benefits for both the patient and the health care providers.

The objective of this study is to identify, among Madrid's adult population, the impact of COVID-19 on self-perceived vulnerability, infectiousness, aversion to germs, and other behaviors in the current situation regarding dental practice. This cross-sectional observational study involves 1,008 persons randomly surveyed on the streets of Madrid, Spain between March 1 and March 8, 2020. Their perceived vulnerability to disease was measured using the perceived vulnerability to disease scale. An additional questionnaire evaluated basic sociodemographic aspects, medical history, personal hygiene behavior, willingness to go to certain places and the perception of the risk of contagion when going to a dental practice. There are significant differences by sex on the germ aversion subscale (p < 0.05) and in the risk of waiting in the waiting room (p < 0.01), tooth extraction ((p < 0.05), endodontics (p < 0.05) and fillings ((p < 0.05). Women consider the risk to be higher than men do. The risk group (over 60 and with systemic disease) has significant differences on the subscales of infectivity (p < 0.01) and germ aversion (p < 0.01). Our study shows high levels of vulnerability regarding contracting COVID-19 and avoiding dental care as perceived by the population over 60 years old and with a systemic disease.","González-Olmo, María José; Ortega-Martínez, Ana Raquel; Delgado-Ramos, Bendición; Romero-Maroto, Martín; Carrillo-Diaz, María",Braz Oral Res,,447

OBJECTIVES: To summarize the existing literature on COVID-19 infection during pregnancy and childbirth, particularly concerning clinical presentation and outcomes. SEARCH STRATEGY: A systematic search of LitCovid, EBSCO MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Scopus electronic databases. The references of relevant studies were also searched. SELECTION CRITERIA: Identified titles and abstracts were screened to select original reports and cross-checked for overlap of cases. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A descriptive summary organized by aspects of clinical presentations (symptoms, imaging, and laboratory) and outcomes (maternal and perinatal). MAIN RESULTS: We identified 33 studies reporting 385 pregnant women with COVID-19 infection: 368 (95.6%) mild; 14 (3.6%) severe; and 3 (0.8%) critical. Seventeen women were admitted to intensive care, including six who were mechanically ventilated and one maternal mortality. A total of 252 women gave birth, comprising 175 (69.4%) cesarean and 77 (30.6%) vaginal births. Outcomes for 256 newborns included four RT-PCR positive neonates, two stillbirths, and one neonatal death.

Also Austria started a lockdown of public life in March 2020. OBJECTIVES: In this study we investigated whether the circulation of different respiratory virus infections in Austria, as assessed by the established respiratory virus surveillance system, is affected by these measures as well and may reflect the success of the lockdown in limiting respiratory virus transmission. STUDY DESIGN: Sentinel data obtained for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and rhinovirus cases were analyzed and compared between the season 2019/2020 and the five previous seasons. RESULTS: We observed a rapid and statistically significant reduction of cumulative cases for all these viruses within short time after the lockdown in March 2020, compared to previous seasons (each p < 0.001). Also, sentinel screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections was performed and a decrease of SARS-CoV-2 was seen after the lockdown. While for the seasonally occurring viruses as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus or human metapneumovirus the lockdown led to the end of the annual epidemics, a re-increase of rhinovirus infections was observed after liberalization of numerous lockdown measures. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide evidence that occurrence of different respiratory virus infections reflect not only the efficiency of lockdown measures taken against SARS-CoV-2 but it shows also the effects of lockdown releases on the transmission of respiratory viruses.","Redlberger-Fritz, Monika; Kundi, Michael; Aberle, Stephan W; Puchhammer-Stöckl, Elisabeth",J Clin Virol,,447

Using the total number of infections per million, we demonstrate that COVID-19 has better predictive power over volatility than over returns for a one-day ahead forecast horizon. Conversely, COVID-19 tends to shape returns more than volatility over a five-day ahead forecast horizon. Our findings remain intact over the two forecast horizons using the total number of deaths per million as an alternative COVID-19 measure.

Vitamin-D has known immune modulatory effects and deficiency has been linked to increased severity of viral infections. METHODS: We evaluated patients admitted with confirmed SARS-COV-2 to our hospital between March-June 2020. Demographics and outcomes were assessed for those admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with normal (>50 nmol/L) and low (<50 nmol/L) vitamin-D. RESULTS: There were 646 SARS-COV-2 PCR positive hospitalisations and 165 (25.5%) had plasma vitamin-D levels. Fifty patients were admitted to ICU. There was no difference in vitamin-D levels of those hospitalised (34, IQR 18.5-66 nmol/L) and those admitted to the ICU (31.5, IQR 21-42 nmol/L). Higher proportion of vitamin-D deficiency (<50 nmol/L) noted in the ICU group (82.0 vs. 65.2%). Among the ICU patients, low vitamin D level (<50 nmol/L) was associated with younger age (57 vs. 67 years, p=0.04) and lower cycle threshold (CT) real time polymerase chain reaction values (RT-PCR) (26.96 vs. 33.6, p=0.02) analogous to higher viral loads. However, there were no significant differences in ICU clinical outcomes (invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury and mechanical ventilation and hospital days) between patients with low and normal vitamin-D levels.

297652,Looking Sideways: Locating Epidemics and Erasures in South Asia,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Covid-19 has had a significant impact on all aspects of health care. We aimed to characterise the trends in emergency general surgery at a district general hospital in Scotland. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed from 23/03/20 to 07/05/20. All emergency general surgery patients were included. Demographics, diagnosis and management were recorded along with Covid-19 testing and results. Thirty-day mortality and readmission rates were also noted. Similar data were collected on patients admitted during the same period in 2019 to allow for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 294 patients were included. There was a 58.3 per cent reduction in admissions when comparing 2020 with 2019 (85 vs 209); however, there was no difference in age (53.2 vs 57.2 years, p = 0.169) or length of stay (4.8 vs 3.7 days, p = 0.133). During 2020, the diagnosis of appendicitis increased (4.3 vs 18.8 per cent, p = < 0.05) as did severity (0 per cent > grade 1 vs 58.3 per cent > grade 1, p = < 0.05). The proportion of patients undergoing surgery increased (19.1 vs 42.3 per cent, p = < 0.05) as did the mean operating time (102.4 vs 145.7 min, p = < 0.05). Surgery was performed in 1 confirmed and 1 suspected Covid-19 patient. The latter died within 30 days. There were no 30-day readmissions with Covid-19 symptoms. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 has significantly impacted the number of admissions to emergency general surgery. However, emergency operating continues to be needed at pre-Covid-19 levels and as such provisions need to be made to facilitate this.","Dick, Lachlan; Green, James; Brown, Jasmine; Kennedy, Ewan; Cassidy, Richard; Othman, Salasiah; Berlansky, Martin",World J Surg,,447

Most of these measures rely on the compliance of people, who are asked to reduce their social contacts to a minimum. In this note we argue that individuals' adherence to prescriptions and reduction of social activity may not be efficacious if not implemented robustly on all social groups, especially on those characterized by intense mixing patterns. Actually, it is possible that, if those who have many contacts have reduced them proportionally less than those who have few, then the effect of a policy could have backfired: the disease has taken more time to die out, up to the point that it has become endemic. In a nutshell, unless one gets everyone to act, and specifically those who have more contacts, a policy may even be counterproductive.","Muscillo, Alessio; Pin, Paolo; Razzolini, Tiziano",PLoS One,,447

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A descriptive study of patients with clinical signs of acute abdomen diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted at out healthcare facility from April 1 to May 10, 2020 was carried out. Clinical records were reviewed for data collection purposes. RESULTS: A series of 14 patients (9 male and 5 female) with a median age of 9.5 years was analyzed. All patients had abdominal pain. There were 11 patients with fever, 9 patients with vomit or diarrhea, and 9 patients with clinically suspected surgical pathology (acute appendicitis or peritonitis). Increased acute phase reactants and coagulation disorders were a common characteristic at blood tests. An abdominal ultrasonography was carried out in all patients, and a CT-scan was performed in 4 patients, which demonstrated inflammatory signs in the terminal ileum, the ileocecal valve and the ascending colon, as well as gallbladder edema. Conservative management was decided upon in all patients except one, and eight patients required intensive care admission for support treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal symptoms can be the primary manifestation of the new coronavirus infection, which simulates an acute abdomen with a potentially unfavorable evolution. For an accurate diagnosis to be achieved, a good clinical record and a comprehensive physical exploration, as well as complementary tests in search of characteristic findings of COVID-19, should be carried out.","Rico Espiñeira, C; Souto Romero, H; Espinosa Góngora, R; Espinoza Vega, M L; Alonso Calderón, J L",Cir Pediatr,,447

The primary outcome was a combination of ventilation variables and parameters over the first four calendar days of ventilation, including tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), respiratory system compliance, and driving pressure in normal-weight, overweight, and obese patients. Secondary outcomes included the use of adjunctive treatments for refractory hypoxaemia and mortality rates. Between 1 March 2020 and 1 June 2020, 1122 patients were included in the study: 244 (21.3%) normal-weight patients, 531 (47.3%) overweight patients, and 324 (28.8%) obese patients. Most patients received a tidal volume < 8 mL/kg PBW; only on the first day was the tidal volume higher in obese patients. PEEP and driving pressure were higher, and compliance of the respiratory system was lower in obese patients on all four days. Adjunctive therapies for refractory hypoxemia were used equally in the three BMI groups. Adjusted mortality rates were not different between BMI categories. The findings of this study suggest that lung-protective ventilation with a lower tidal volume and prone positioning is similarly feasible in normal-weight, overweight, and obese patients with ARDS related to COVID-19. A patient's BMI should not be used in decisions to forgo or proceed with invasive ventilation.","Schavemaker, Renée; Schultz, Marcus J; Lagrand, Wim K; van Slobbe-Bijlsma, Eline R; Serpa Neto, Ary; Paulus, Frederique",,,447

Integumentary manifestations from COVID-19 include exanthemas and papular dermatoses, urticarial eruptions, atopic dermatitis, vesiculobullous lesions and skin signs of hypercoagulable states, such as acral ischemia, livedo and retiforme purpura. Most common extra cutaneous manifestations from the disease include headache, cough, anosmia, ageusia, fever, dyspnea, nausea, diarrhea and cardiovascular events. The objectives of this review are to discuss the role of human cell receptors described as interaction targets of SARS-CoV-2, as well to understand the current state of knowledge on skin expression of these receptors, in order to substantiate future research. The authors present a thorough literature review on SARS-CoV-2 and its possible interaction with cell receptors and human tissues including the skin. They discuss a molecular hypothesis to explain the lower prevalence of dermatological manifestations from direct SARS-CoV-2 infection. Distinct human cell receptors binding the virus appear to be less expressed in the skin compared to other organs. Additionally, the presence of resolvins and the desintegrin metalloprotease ADAM17 provide a putative protection to the skin, explaining the majority of COVID-19 manifestations to be extra cutaneous. This review represents an excellent opportunity for future studies using skin biopsies from COVID-19 patients to investigate molecular expression in the pathophysiology of cutaneous manifestations of the disease.","Criado, Paulo Ricardo; Pincelli, Thais Prota Hussein; Criado, Roberta Fachini Jardim; Abdalla, Beatrice Martinez Zugaib; Belda Junior, Walter",Exp. dermatol,,447

Findings from a life cycle assessment of polyhydroxyalkanoate production from rapeseed-oil derivatives,2020,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of critically ill children managed in an intensive care unit because of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia with respiratory support requirements. METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective observational study in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with 32 beds in Ankara City Hospital, Ankara, Turkey, from 13 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. Patients who needed positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) therapy for COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were extracted from the patients' electronic medical records. As outcomes, the hospitalization rate of all pediatric patients diagnosed as having with COVID-19 by Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR), PICU admission rate for COVID-19 pneumonia among all hospitalized patients, PPV support rate, intensive care hospitalization duration (days), total hospitalization duration (days), survival rate and tracheotomy requirement were evaluated. RESULTS: During the study period, 7033 children tested positive for COVID-19 in PCR tests. Of these patients, 1219 were hospitalized for COVID-19. Seventeen patients needed PPV support because of COVID-19 pneumonia. High proportion (65%) of patients admitted to the PICU had comorbid diseases. Noninvasive ventilation was applied in 15 patients (88%). The hospitalization rate among the children with COVID-19 was 17%, of whom 1.6% were admitted to the PICU. Mortality rates were 0.056% of all the cases and 0.32% of the hospitalized patients in our hospital. CONCLUSION: The presence of a comorbid disease could be a sign of severe disease in children with higher lethality. Very few children required PPV support because of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","Ozcan, Serhan; Emeksiz, Serhat; Perk, Oktay; Uyar, Emel; Kanik Yüksek, Saliha",J. trop. pedriatr,,447
316471,Buchrezension zu: Pest und Corona,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Access to health care and care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic may be challenging for cancer patients. Several guidelines have been developed, which recommend treatment adjustments depending on the site of cancer, grade, and stage. However, few studies in India and across the globe have looked into the real challenges faced by cancer patients and assessed the effectiveness of the adopted interventions. This study was undertaken with the objective to study the challenges faced by cancer patients in India during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study undertaken between May 1, 2020 and May 15, 2020. A link to a prestructured questionnaire was sent through email to 100 randomly selected cancer patients in different stages of treatment and follow-up. Data were decoded and entered in Microsoft Excel 2010 and analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Slot availability for teleconsultation, network issues, deferral of radiotherapy dates and long waiting hours beyond appointment time, transportation problems from residence to hospital, restriction of visitors/attendants, deferral of surgery, deferral of tumor boards, delay and deferral of advice of the nutritionist, problems faced in extension of visa, unavailability of peer group support services and psychological counseling sessions, difficulty in maintaining precautionary measures, availability of chemotherapy medications and availability of chemotherapy slots in day care were cited as problems faced by cancer patients. Majority (91.7%) of the study respondents mentioned an increase in their anxiety levels. CONCLUSION: As highlighted in the study, cancer patients faced challenges in cancer care delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study suggests the need for larger studies on cancer patient care during a pandemic.","Mitra, Manasij; Basu, Maitraye",J Prim Care Community Health,,447

This is an enormous opportunity for real-estate operators to innovate and address the demand in this growing market. However, investments in this area are fraught with risk. Seniors often have more health issues, and Covid-19 has exposed just how vulnerable they are -- especially those living in close proximity. Conventionally, most services for seniors are""high-touch"", requiring close physical contact with trained caregivers. Not only are trained caregivers short in supply, but the pandemic has made it evident that conventional high-touch approaches to senior care are high-cost and greater risk. There are not enough caregivers to meet the needs of this emerging demographic, and even fewer who want to undertake the additional training and risk of working in a senior facility, especially given the current pandemic. In this article, we rethink the design of senior living facilities to mitigate the risks and costs using automation. With AI-enabled pervasive automation, we claim there is an opportunity, if not an urgency, to go from high-touch to almost""no touch""while dramatically reducing risk and cost. Although our vision goes beyond the current reality, we cite measurements from Caspar AI-enabled senior properties that show the potential benefit of this approach.","Saxena, Ashutosh; Cheriton, David R",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05129v3.pdf,447

Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses an analytical survey study of 137 Chinese academic libraries using data collected through a combination of website investigation, social media access and direct correspondences. Findings: Over 94% of Chinese academic libraries released COVID-19-related information through their websites; the majority switched their service focus to partly or solely remotely online, including remote access, free electronic resources, virtual references reachable 24/7 and research support services deliverable online; services of print materials were altered to e-books for conveniences. Research limitations/implications: It should be noted that the survey was conducted from February 12 to April 5, 2020; because of the rapid updates to the library's website and social media channels, the status of their patron services are in the process of dynamic changes and that there should be many libraries that have adopted some patron service methods, but this study is difficult to cover comprehensively. In addition, patron services carried out offline by the surveyed libraries but not disclosed on the online platform could not be analyzed in a way that would be consistent with the data provided by the survey. Originality/value: By providing evidence of the current status of patron services in Chinese academic libraries during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study helps fulfill the scant empirical attention given to the impact of nationwide public health crises on academic libraries and offers new data of the best practices that help library administrators enhance the impact, efficiency and value of library services to their target community users.","Guo, Yajun; Yang, Zinan; Yang, Zhishun; Liu, Yan Quan; Bielefield, Arlene; Tharp, Gregory",Libr.

Secondarily we aimed to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study conducted at Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre during weeks 10 to 19 of 2020, coinciding with the Spanish lockdown. We tested 769 serum samples obtained from routine serological testing during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy for specific IgG anti SARS-CoV-2 RBD and S proteins. RT-PCR tests were performed in suspected cases according to clinical practice. We compared maternal and perinatal outcomes in those with delivered pregnancies (n = 578) according to the presence or absence of specific IgG antibodies. Those with positive IgG were subdivided by the presence or absence of Covid-19 related symptoms at any time and the results of RT-PCR testing if performed. Therefore, we had 4 study groups: G1 (IgG negative), G2 (IgG positive, asymptomatic, RT-PCR testing negative or not done), G3 (IgG positive, symptomatic, RT-PCR testing negative or not done), and G4 (IgG positive, symptomatic, RT-PCR positive). RESULTS: Seropositivity increased from 0% to 21.4% (95% CI 11.8-31.0) during the study period, of which 27.9% had an asymptomatic course. Overall outcomes were favorable with a significant increased rate of preterm birth in G4 vs G1 (21.4% vs 6.7%) and cesarean/operative delivery (50% vs 26.9%). Asymptomatic and mild cases did not have differences regarding pregnancy course when compared to seronegative women. There were no documented cases of vertical or horizontal transmission. CONCLUSION: Seroprevalence in pregnant women in southern Madrid went up to 21.4% of which 27.9% had an asymptomatic course. Overall perinatal results were favorable, especially in those asymptomatic.","Villalaín, Cecilia; Herraiz, Ignacio; Luczkowiak, Joanna; Pérez-Rivilla, Alfredo; Folgueira, María Dolores; Mejía, Inmaculada; Batllori, Emma; Felipe, Eva; Risco, Beatriz; Galindo, Alberto; Delgado, Rafael",PLoS One,,447

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether particular cytokine profiles are associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality. METHODS: Cytokine concentrations and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antigen were measured at hospital admission in serum of symptomatic patients with COVID-19 (N = 115), classified at hospitalization into 3 respiratory severity groups: no need for mechanical ventilatory support (No-MVS), intermediate severity requiring mechanical ventilatory support (MVS), and critical severity requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Principal-component analysis was used to characterize cytokine profiles associated with severity and mortality. The results were thereafter confirmed in an independent validation cohort (N = 86). RESULTS: At time of hospitalization, ECMO patients presented a dominant proinflammatory response with elevated levels of TNF-&#945;, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10. In contrast, an elevated type-I interferon response involving IFN-&#945; and IFN-ß was characteristic of No-MVS patients, whereas MVS patients exhibited both profiles. Mortality at 1 month was associated with higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines in ECMO patients, higher levels of type-I interferons in No-MVS patients, and their combination in MVS patients, resulting in a combined mortality prediction accuracy of 88.5% (risk ratio, 24.3; P < .0001). Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antigen levels correlated with type-I interferon levels and were associated with mortality, but not with proinflammatory response or severity. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct cytokine profiles are observed in association with COVID-19 severity and are differentially predictive of mortality according to oxygen support modalities. These results warrant personalized treatment of COVID-19 patients based on cytokine profiling.","Dorgham, Karim; Quentric, Paul; Gökkaya, Mehmet; Marot, Stéphane; Parizot, Christophe; Sauce, Delphine; Guihot, Amélie; Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Schmidt, Matthieu; Mayaux, Julien; Beurton, Alexandra; Le Guennec, Loic; Demeret, Sophie; Ben Salah, Elyes; Mathian, Alexis; Yssel, Hans; Combadiere, Béhazine; Combadiere, Christophe; Traidl-Hoffmann, Claudia; Burrel, Sonia; Marcelin, Anne-Geneviève; Amoura, Zahir; Voiriot, Guillaume; Neumann, Avidan U; Gorochov, Guy",J Allergy Clin Immunol,,447
365999,Epidemien und gesellschaftliches Leben,2021,"Data-driven artificial intelligence models fed with published scientific findings have been used to create powerful prediction engines for scientific and technological advance, such as the discovery of novel materials with desired properties and the targeted invention of new therapies and vaccines. These AI approaches typically ignore the distribution of human prediction engines -- scientists and inventor -- who continuously alter the landscape of discovery and invention. As a result, AI hypotheses are designed to substitute for human experts, failing to complement them for punctuated collective advance. Here we show that incorporating the distribution of human expertise into self-supervised models by training on inferences cognitively available to experts dramatically improves AI prediction of future human discoveries and inventions. Including expert-awareness into models that propose (a) valuable energy-relevant materials increases the precision of materials predictions by ~100%, (b) repurposing thousands of drugs to treat new diseases increases precision by 43%, and (c) COVID-19 vaccine candidates examined in clinical trials by 260%. These models succeed by predicting human predictions and the scientists who will make them.

Depending on the level of risk for exposure to the virus, the facemasks that are used can vary. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of different types of facemasks, typically used by healthcare professionals and the public during the COVID-19 pandemic, on measures of voice. METHODS: Nineteen adults (ten females, nine males) with a normal voice quality completed sustained vowel tasks. All tasks were performed for each of the six mask conditions: no mask, cloth mask, surgical mask, KN95 mask and, surgical mask over a KN95 mask with and without a face shield. Intensity measurements were obtained at a 1ft and 6ft distance from the speaker with sound level meters. Tasks were recorded with a 1ft mouth-to-microphone distance. Acoustic variables of interest were fundamental frequency (F0), and formant frequencies (F1, F2) for /a/ and /i/ and smoothed cepstral peak prominence (CPPs) for /a/. RESULTS: Data were analyzed to compare differences between sex and mask types. There was statistical significance between males and females for intensity measures and all acoustic variables except F2 for /a/ and F1 for /i/. Few pairwise comparisons between masks reached significance even though main effects for mask type were observed. These are further discussed in the article. CONCLUSION: The masks tested in this study did not have a significant impact on intensity, fundamental frequency, CPPs, first or second formant frequency compared to voice output without a mask. Use of a face shield seemed to affect intensity and CPPs to some extent. Implications of these findings are discussed further in the article.","Joshi, Ashwini; Procter, Teresa; Kulesz, Paulina A",J. voice,,447

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a list of conditions and associated behaviors, including smoking, conferring vulnerability to severe COVID-19 illness regardless of age. This study examines young adults' medical vulnerability to severe COVID-19 illness, focusing on smoking-related behavior. METHODS: A young adult subsample (aged 18-25 years) was developed from the National Health Interview Survey, a nationally representative data set, pooling years 2016-2018. The medical vulnerability measure (yes vs. no) was developed, guided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention medical indicators. The estimates of medical vulnerability were developed for the full sample, the nonsmoking sample, and the individual risk indicators. Logistic regressions were conducted to examine differences by sex, race/ethnicity, income, and insurance. RESULTS: Medical vulnerability was 32% for the full sample and half that (16%) for the nonsmoking sample. Patterns and significance of some subgroup differences differed between the full and the nonsmoking sample. Male vulnerability was (33%) higher than female (30%; 95% CI: .7-.9) in the full sample, but lower in nonsmokers: male (14%) versus female (19%; 95% CI: 1.2-1.7). The white subgroup had higher vulnerability than Hispanic and Asian subgroups in both samples-full sample: white (31%) versus Hispanic (24%; 95% CI: .6-.9) and Asian (18%; 95% CI: .4-.5); nonsmokers: white (17%) versus Hispanic (13%; 95% CI: .06-.9) and Asian (10%; 95% CI: .3-.8). CONCLUSIONS: Notably, lower young adult medical vulnerability within nonsmokers versus the full sample underscores the importance of smoking prevention and mitigation.","Adams, Sally H; Park, M Jane; Schaub, Jason P; Brindis, Claire D; Irwin, Charles E",J Adolesc Health,,447

In Spain, the first wave was particularly severe among the population and health care professionals, many of whom were infected. These professionals required initial psychological supports that were gradual and in line with their conditions. OBJECTIVE: In the early days of the pandemic in Spain (March 2020), this study aimed to design and validate a scale to measure acute stress experienced by the health care workforce during the care of patients with COVID-19: the Self-applied Acute Stress Scale (EASE). METHODS: Item development, scale development, and scale evaluation were considered. Qualitative research was conducted to produce the initial pool of items, assure their legibility, and assess the validity of the content. Internal consistency was calculated using Cronbach &#945; and McDonald &#969;. Confirmatory factor analysis and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test were used to assess construct validity. Linear regression was applied to assess criterion validity. Back-translation methodology was used to translate the scale into Portuguese and English. RESULTS: A total of 228 health professionals from the Spanish public health system responded to the 10 items of the EASE scale. Internal consistency was .87 (McDonald &#969;). Goodness-of-fit indices confirmed a two-factor structure, explaining 55% of the variance. As expected, the highest level of stress was found among professionals working in health services where a higher number of deaths from COVID-19 occurred (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: The EASE scale was shown to have adequate metric properties regarding consistency and construct validity. The EASE scale could be used to determine the levels of acute stress among the health care workforce in order to give them proportional support according to their needs during emergency conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mira, Jose Joaquin; Cobos, Angel; Martínez García, Olga; Bueno Domínguez, María José; Astier-Peña, María Pilar; Pérez Pérez, Pastora; Carrillo, Irene; Guilabert, Mercedes; Perez-Jover, Virtudes; Fernandez, Cesar; Vicente, María Asuncion; Lahera-Martin, Matilde; Silvestre Busto, Carmen; Lorenzo Martínez, Susana; Sanchez Martinez, Ascension; Martin-Delgado, Jimmy; Mula, Aurora; Marco-Gomez, Barbara; Abad Bouzan, Cristina; Aibar-Remon, Carlos; Aranaz-Andres, Jesus",JMIR Form Res,,447

METHODS: A sample of 2619 US-licensed psychologists completed a survey assessing telepsychology use and aspects of both models in May 2020. RESULTS: Cross-sectional TRA and TAM path models evidenced excellent fit in explaining psychologists' telepsychology use. The TRA indicated that psychologists' attitudes concerning telepsychology and subjective norms were associated with intentions to use telepsychology, which related to percentage of clinical work performed via telepsychology. The TAM showed that perceived usefulness of telepsychology and perceived ease of use were associated with attitudes toward telepsychology. Perceived usefulness was associated with psychologists' intention to use telepsychology, as was perceived ease of use. CONCLUSION: Efforts to facilitate telepsychology provision during the pandemic and broadly may benefit from trainings and campaigns to address attitudes toward telepsychology, subjective norms, and perceived ease of use.","McKee, Grace B; Pierce, Bradford S; Donovan, Emily K; Perrin, Paul B",J. clin. psychol,,447

Interestingly, this opens new possibilities to separately investigate risk factors for infection and risk factors for becoming diseased.

METHODS: 1917 corneae (1000 patients) were allocated to decades of age, classified according to Belin's ABCD KC grading system and the stage distribution was analysed. RESULTS: 73 per cent (n=728) of the patients were males, 27% (n=272) were females. The highest KC prevalence occurred between 21 and 30 years (n=585 corneae, 294 patients). Regarding anterior (A) and posterior (B) curvature, the frequency of A was significantly higher than B in all age groups for stage 0, 1 and 2 (A0>B0; A1>B1; A2>B2; p<0.03, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test). There was no significant difference between the number of A3 and B3, but significantly more corneae were classified as B4 than A4 in all age groups (p<0.02). The most frequent A|B combinations were A4|B4 (n=451), A0|B0 (n=311), A2|B4 (n=242), A2|B2 (n=189) and A1|B2 (n=154). Concerning thinnest pachymetry (C), most corneae in all age groups were classified as C0>C1>C2>C3>C4 (p<0.04, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test). For the best distance visual acuity (D), a significantly higher number of corneae were classified as D1 compared to D0 (p<0.008; D1>D0>D2>D3>D4). CONCLUSION: The stage distributions in all age groups were similar. Early KC rather becomes manifest in the posterior than the anterior corneal curvature whereas advanced stages of posterior corneal curvature coincide with early and advanced stages of anterior corneal curvature. Thus, this study emphasises the necessity of posterior corneal surface assessment in KC as enabled by the ABCD grading system.","Flockerzi, Elias; Xanthopoulou, Kassandra; Goebels, Susanne Christiane; Zemova, Elena; Razafimino, Sonia; Hamon, Loïc; Jullien, Theresia; Klühspies, Ulrike; Eppig, Timo; Langenbucher, Achim; Seitz, Berthold",Br. j. ophthalmol,,447

We used data imputation techniques in addition to statistical analysis to convert raw real-world data sets into meaningful data for causal inference. The application of various algorithms for the detection of causal linkages between the indicators is the subject of this research. Despite the fact that disparities in governmental policies between countries account for differences in causal linkages, several indicators emerge as important determinants sensitive to disease outbreaks over the world in the 21st Century.","Marathe, Aboli; Parekh, Saloni; Sakhrani, Harsh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07266v2.pdf,447

The worldwide concern about the safety of patients and professionals in these institutions is relevant. In Brasil, a large part of post-acute care and chronic patients is performed at home through Home Care (HC). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 in Home Care patients and the clinical outcomes of these patients; it also aims to assess the impact of the epidemic on the number of patients, new admissions, and hospitalizations. METHODS: A descriptive study of the COVID-19 cases that affected the population in care by Home Doctor (a private company of Home Care), between the months of March 2020 and May 2020 and analysis of the total number of patients, the hospitalization and death rate in the period compared to the pre-epidemic period. RESULTS: There were 31 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 21 of which were male, mean age 73 years. All patients had multiple comorbidities, the most prevalent were: Systemic Arterial Hypertension (54%) and Stroke (35%). The incidence of COVID-19 was 1% in the studied population. There were 10 hospitalizations with 5 hospital deaths and one case of home death (lethality 19%). Safe care was maintained, with a low death rate (0.6%) and hospitalization (6.1%). CONCLUSION: Home Care is able to maintain safe care during the pandemic due to COVID-19, with a low incidence of COVID-19, low hospitalization rate, and low mortality when compared to nursing homes institutions.","Gaspar, Heloisa Amaral; Oliveira, Cláudio Flauzino de; Jacober, Fabiana Camolesi; Deus, Eduardo Roberto de; Canuto, Flavia",Rev.

403468,Upregulation of Neuroprogenitor and Neural Markers via Enforced miR-124 and Growth Factor Treatment,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus identified as the cause of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) that began in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and spread now in 210 countries and territories around the world. Many people are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. However, in some cases (usually the elderly and those with comorbidities) the disease may progress to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ dysfunction that can lead to death. Such wide interindividual differences in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection may relate to several pathogen-and host-related factors. These include the different levels of the ubiquitously present human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors gene expression and its variant alleles, the different binding affinities of ACE2 to the virus spike (S) protein given its L-and S-subtypes and the subsequent extent of innate immunity-related hypercytokinemia. The extensive synthesis of cytokines and chemokines in coronavirus diseases was suggested as a major factor in exacerbating lung damage and other fatal complications. The polymorphisms in genes coding for pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines have been associated with mediating the response and susceptibility to a wide range of infections and their severe outcomes. Understanding the nature of pathogen–host interaction in COVID-19 symptomatology together with the role of hypercytokinemia in disease severity may permit developing new avenues of approach for prevention and treatment and can delineate public health measures to control the spread of the disease.","Badawi, Alaa",J.

406396,"Leptospira-Zebra under the ""corona herd"" Leptospira - Zebra unter der Coronaherde",2020,"Unlike most countries, Korea did not implement a lockdown in its battle against COVID-19, instead successfully relying on testing and contact tracing. Until the summer of 2020, only one region, Daegu-Gyeongbuk, had a significant number of infections, traced to a religious sect. This allows us to estimate the causal effect of the outbreak on the labor market using difference-in-differences. We find that a one per thousand increase in infections caused a 2 to 3 percent drop in local employment in the early spring. We also find that employment losses caused by local outbreaks in the absence of lockdowns were (i) mainly due to reduced hiring by small establishments, (ii) concentrated in the accommodation/food, education, real estate, and transportation industries, and (iii) worst for economically vulnerable workers who are less educated, young, in low-wage occupations, and on temporary contracts, even controlling for industry effects. These patterns are similar to what we observed in the US and UK: The unequal effects of COVID-19 were the same with or without lockdowns. Our findings are consistent with the lifting of lockdowns having led to only modest employment recoveries in the US and UK, absent larger drops in infection rates.","Aum, Sangmin Lee Sang Yoon Shin Yongseok",Labour Economics,,447
406495,Die digitale Transformation der Medizin,2020,"BACKGROUND: Despite recent achievements in vaccines, antiviral drugs, and medical infrastructure, the emergence of COVID-19 has posed a serious threat to humans worldwide. Most countries are well connected on a global scale, making it nearly impossible to implement perfect and prompt mitigation strategies for infectious disease outbreaks. In particular, due to the explosive growth of international travel, the complex network of human mobility enabled the rapid spread of COVID-19 globally. OBJECTIVE: South Korea was one of the earliest countries to be affected by COVID-19. In the absence of vaccines and treatments, South Korea has implemented and maintained stringent interventions, such as large-scale epidemiological investigations, rapid diagnosis, social distancing, and prompt clinical classification of severely ill patients with appropriate medical measures. In particular, South Korea has implemented effective airport screenings and quarantine measures. In this study, we aimed to assess the country-specific importation risk of COVID-19 and investigate its impact on the local transmission of COVID-19. METHODS: The country-specific importation risk of COVID-19 in South Korea was assessed. We investigated the relationships between country-specific imported cases, passenger numbers, and the severity of country-specific COVID-19 prevalence from January to October 2020. We assessed the country-specific risk by incorporating country-specific information. A renewal mathematical model was employed, considering both imported and local cases of COVID-19 in South Korea. Furthermore, we estimated the basic and effective reproduction numbers. RESULTS: The risk of importation from China was highest between January and February 2020, while that from North America (the United States and Canada) was high from April to October 2020. The R0 was estimated at 1.87 (95% CI 1.47-2.34), using the rate of &#945;=0.07 for secondary transmission caused by imported cases. The Rt was estimated in South Korea and in both Seoul and Gyeonggi. CONCLUSIONS: A statistical model accounting for imported and locally transmitted cases was employed to estimate R0 and Rt. Our results indicated that the prompt implementation of airport screening measures (contact tracing with case isolation and quarantine) successfully reduced local transmission caused by imported cases despite passengers arriving from high-risk countries throughout the year. Moreover, various mitigation interventions, including social distancing and travel restrictions within South Korea, have been effectively implemented to reduce the spread of local cases in South Korea.","Lee, Hyojung; Kim, Yeahwon; Kim, Eunsu; Lee, Sunmi",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,447

We apply long-read RNA and cDNA sequencing to in vitro human and primate infection models to study transcriptional dynamics. Transcription-regulating sequence (TRS)-dependent sgRNA upregulates earlier in infection than TRS-independent sgRNA. An abundant class of TRS-independent sgRNA consisting of a portion of open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) containing nsp1 joins to ORF10, and the 3' untranslated region (UTR) upregulates at 48 h post-infection in human cell lines. We identify double-junction sgRNA containing both TRS-dependent and -independent junctions. We find multiple sites at which the SARS-CoV-2 genome is consistently more modified than sgRNA and that sgRNA modifications are stable across transcript clusters, host cells, and time since infection. Our work highlights the dynamic nature of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome during its replication cycle.","Chang, Jessie J-Y; Rawlinson, Daniel; Pitt, Miranda E; Taiaroa, George; Gleeson, Josie; Zhou, Chenxi; Mordant, Francesca L; De Paoli-Iseppi, Ricardo; Caly, Leon; Purcell, Damian F J; Stinear, Timothy P; Londrigan, Sarah L; Clark, Michael B; Williamson, Deborah A; Subbarao, Kanta; Coin, Lachlan J M",Cell Rep,,447

This study investigated sleep disorders in a large cohort of patients with breast cancer before and during the pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-three characteristics were retrospectively analyzed for associations with pre-radiotherapy sleep disorders in 338 patients. Moreover, 163 patients presenting before and 175 patients presenting during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared for sleep disorders. RESULTS: Sleep disorders were significantly associated with age &#8804;60 years (p=0.006); high distress score (p<0.0001); more emotional (p<0.0001), physical (p<0.0001) or practical (p<0.0001) problems; psycho-oncological need (p<0.0001); invasive cancer (p=0.003); chemotherapy (p<0.001); and hormonal therapy (p=0.006). Sleep disorders were similarly common in both groups (prior to vs. during the pandemic: 40% vs. 45%, p=0.38). CONCLUSION: Although additional significant risk factors for sleep disorders were identified, the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to have no significant impact on sleep disorders in patients scheduled for irradiation of breast cancer.","Rades, Dirk; Narvaez, Carlos A; Schild, Steven E; Tvilsted, Soeren; Kjaer, Troels W",In Vivo,,447

422840,A systematic review of human coronaviruses survival on environmental surfaces,2021,"BACKGROUND: In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, US hospitals have canceled elective surgeries. This decline in total joint arthroplasty (TJA) revenue may place financial strain on hospitals. Our goal was to quantify the impact of COVID-19 on the public interest in elective TJA. METHODS: The Google Search Volume Index (GSVI) identified the terms ""knee replacement,"" ""hip replacement,"" and ""orthopedic surgeon"" as the most common to describe TJA. The term ""elective surgery cancellation"" was also analyzed. Weekly GSVI data were extracted between 04-01-2015 and 04-04-2020. Time series analysis was conducted and state GSVI values were compared with COVID-19 prevalence and unemployment claims. RESULTS: The relative public interest in elective TJA has sharply declined since the WHO declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Between 03-01-2020 and 03-29-2020, the popularity of searches for ""knee replacement"", ""hip replacement,"" and ""orthopedic surgeon"" dropped by 62.1%, 52.1%, and 44.3%, respectively. A concurrent spike was observed for the term ""elective surgery cancellation."" California, New Hampshire, Maine, and Nevada showed a low relative rate for TJA searches, and the highest increase in unemployment claims. CONCLUSION: The onset of COVID-19 correlates with declining relative popularity of searches related to elective TJA. Higher volume of COVID-19 cases in certain states may correspond with lower relative search popularity, although this correlation remains unclear. These results portend the possibility of a decline in elective TJA case volume, further straining hospitals. Further research is required to inform stakeholders how best to proceed and determine any sustained effects from the current diminished relative interest in TJA.

431058,Metagenomic insights into the effect of thermal hydrolysis pre-treatment on microbial community of an anaerobic digestion system,2021,"Sea cucumbers are fished worldwide for export to Asia, but few studies have evaluated metal pollution and risk assessment. This study assessed concentration of trace metals and the potential ecological risk in sea cucumber (Holothuria floridana) and sediments at the Cispatá Bay, in the Caribbean Coast of Colombia. The trace metal concentrations in biota and sediments showed a similar decreasing trend as follows: Cu > Zn > Hg > Pb > Cd. The highest bioconcentration factor was found for Hg, and according to the sediment quality guidelines, Cu levels indicate adverse biological effects in the ecosystem. In this regard, Cu levels were higher than effects range low and the threshold effect levels (TEL) and lowest effect level in all the stations, whereas Hg levels were higher than TEL in most of them. Results for health risk assessment based on the maximum allowable daily consumption rate (CRlim) suggest that there is no risk to adults; however, children should limit or avoid its consumption. Results from multivariate statistical analysis suggest that agricultural activities (i.e., application of fertilizers and agrochemicals) were identified as the main anthropogenic sources of metal pollution. This research suggest that sea cucumber could be used as a bioindicator species in studies of monitoring metal contamination, with special attention to the highly significant correlation between Zn in tissue and sediments. This study also reveals that anthropic activities may have negative effects in the quality of the sediments of the bay and contributing to the knowledge of metal accumulation in sea cucumber.Graphical abstract.","Marrugo-Negrete, José; Pinedo-Hernández, José; Marrugo-Madrid, Siday; Navarro-Frómeta, Enrique; Díez, Sergi",Biol. trace elem. res,,447

Nevertheless, the role and mechanism of exosomal miR-638 in HCC development remain largely unknown. Methods: Exosomes were isolated and confirmed via transmission electron microscopy and western blot. The abundances of miR-638 and specificity protein 1 (SP1) were measured via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or western blot. Cell proliferation was investigated by Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation assay, apoptosis, cell cycle distribution and related protein expression. Cell migration and invasion were detected via transwell assay and western blot. Co-culture experiment was performed to assess exosome transfer from HCC cells to endothelial cells. The target correlation between miR-638 and SP1 was analyzed via dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. The subcutaneous xenograft experiment was conducted to test the function of miR-638 in vivo. Results: The miR-638 level declined in exosomes from serum or HCC cell medium. miR-638 overexpression repressed HCC cell proliferation by decreasing viability and colony formation and inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, and decreased abilities of migration and invasion. Exosomal miR-638 from HCC cells could transfer to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and suppress HUVEC proliferation, migration and invasion. SP1 was a target of miR-638 and overexpression of SP1 reversed the effect of miR-638 on HCC cells. Overexpression of miR-638 reduced xenograft tumor growth via decreasing SP1. Conclusion: Exosomal miR-638 inhibited HCC tumorigenesis by targeting SP1. This study indicated the potential clinical implications of miR-638 in HCC.","Yang, Jing; Li, Bo; Zhao, Shuo; Du, Hongyu; Du, Yaming",Onco Targets Ther,,447

In this paper, we discuss how blockchain technology can be used for assuring the transparent tracing of COVID-19 vaccine registration, storage and delivery, and side effects self-reporting. We present such system implementation in which blockchain technology is used for assuring data integrity and immutability in case of beneficiary registration for vaccination, eliminating identity thefts and impersonations. Smart contracts are defined to monitor and track the proper vaccine distribution conditions against the safe handling rules defined by vaccine producers enabling the awareness of all network peers. For vaccine administration, a transparent and tamper-proof side effects self-reporting solution is provided considering person identification and administrated vaccine association. A prototype was implemented using the Ethereum test network, Ropsten, considering the COVID-19 vaccine distribution tracking conditions. The results obtained for each on-chain operation can be checked and validated on the Etherscan, demonstrating various aspects of the proposed system such as immunization actors and safe rules registration, vaccine tracking, and administration.

Clinical evaluation including a battery of investigation such as hematological, biochemical,imaging, and endoscopy did not reveal any abnormality. However, her nasopharyngeal and nasal swab samples tested positive forSARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We placed her on the approved COVID-19 regimen comprising lopinavir/ritonavir,zinc sulfate, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin with augmentin, vitamin C, metoclopramide and intravenous fluid for one week.The vomiting subsided within 48-h of commencing the medications, and she became asymptomatic after 72-h. Repeat PCR after 12 days returned negative for SARS-CoV-2. This case report highlights the unusual clinical feature of COVID-19. It, therefore, underscores the need to thoroughly investigate symptomatic patients and also to optimize standard precaution as potentially infectious diseases such as COVID-19 may “masquerade” as a vague constitutional symptom(s)","Ballah Akawu, Denue Ngamariju Sepu",The Nigerian Journal of Medicine,,447

454995,[Challenges for science journalism in the Corona pandemic-some observations about a mediated world event]./ Herausforderungen für den Journalismus über Wissenschaft in der Coronapandemie ­ erste Beobachtungen zu einem Weltereignis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma (CP) is being used as a treatment option in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Till date, there is conflicting evidence on efficacy of CP in reducing COVID-19 related mortality. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of CP on 28-day mortality reduction in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We did a multi-centre, retrospective case control observational study from 1st May 2020 to 31st August 2020. A total of 1079 adult patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 requiring oxygen, were reviewed. Of these, 694 patients were admitted to ICU. Out of these, 333 were given CP along with best supportive care and remaining 361 received best supportive care only. RESULTS: In the overall group of 1079 patients, mortality in plasma vs no plasma group was statistically not significant (22.4% vs 18.5%; p = 0.125; OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 0.94--1.72). However, in patients with COVID-19 admitted to ICU, mortality was significantly lower in plasma group (25.5% vs 33.2%; p = 0.026; OR = 0.69, 95%CI: 0.50-0.96). This benefit of reduced mortality was most seen in age group 60 to 74 years (26.7% vs 43.0%; p = 0.004; OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.29-0.80), driven mostly by females of this age group (23.1% vs 53.5%; p = 0.013; OR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.09-0.78). Significant difference in mortality was observed in patients with one comorbidity (22.3% vs 36.5%; p = 0.004; OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.31-0.80). Moreover, patients on ventilator had significantly lower mortality in the plasma arm (37.2% vs 49.3%; p = 0.009; OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.42-0.89); particularly so for patients on invasive mechanical ventilation (63.9% vs 82.9%; p = 0.014; OR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.16-0.83). CONCLUSION: The use of CP was associated with reduced mortality in COVID-19 elderly patients admitted in ICU, above 60 years of age, particularly females, those with comorbidities and especially those who required some form of ventilation.","Budhiraja, Sandeep; Dewan, Arun; Aggarwal, Ritesh; Singh, Omender; Juneja, Deven; Pathak, Sangeeta; Singh, Y P; Gupta, Ajay; Rai, Reeta; Indrayan, Abhaya; Jha, Vinitaa; Naithani, Rahul",Blood Cells Mol Dis,,447

Most of the common cold illnesses are caused by one of four HCoVs, namely HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43. Several studies have applied global transcriptomic methods to understand host responses to HCoV infection, with most studies focusing on the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2. In this study, Next Generation Sequencing was used to gain new insights into cellular transcriptomic changes elicited by alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E. HCoV-229E-infected MRC-5 cells showed marked downregulation of superpathway of cholesterol biosynthesis and eIF2 signaling pathways. Moreover, upregulation of cyclins, cell cycle control of chromosomal replication, and the role of BRCA1 in DNA damage response, alongside downregulation of the cell cycle G1/S checkpoint, suggest that HCoV-229E may favors S phase for viral infection. Intriguingly, a significant portion of key factors of cell innate immunity, interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and other transcripts of early antiviral response genes were downregulated early in HCoV-229E infection. On the other hand, early upregulation of the antiviral response factor Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3B (APOBEC3B) was observed. APOBEC3B cytidine deaminase signature (C-to-T) was previously observed in genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 but not HCoV-229E. Higher levels of C-to-T mutations were found in countries with high mortality rates caused by SARS-CoV-2. APOBEC activity could be a marker for new emerging CoVs. This study will enhance our understanding of commonly circulating HCoVs and hopefully provide critical information about still-emerging coronaviruses.","Friedman, Nehemya; Jacob-Hirsch, Jasmine; Drori, Yaron; Eran, Eyal; Kol, Nitzan; Nayshool, Omri; Mendelson, Ella; Rechavi, Gideon; Mandelboim, Michal",PLoS One,,447

The SE(A+O)R model with infectives separated into asymptomatic and ordinary carriers, supplemented by a model of the data generation process, is calibrated to standard datasets for several countries. It is shown that certain fundamental parameters, notably r, are unidentifiable with this data. A number of potential types of policy intervention are analyzed. It is found that the lack of parameter identifiability implies that only some, but not all, potential policy interventions can be correctly predicted. In an example representing Italy in March 2020, a hypothetical optimal policy of isolating confirmed cases that aims to reduce the basic reproduction number of the outbreak to R0 = 0.8 assuming r = 10%, only achieves R0 = 1.4 if it turns out that r = 40%.","Pang, Weijie; Chehaitli, Hassan; Hurd, T.

460138,Caution: Wit and Humor During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Virtual outpatient clinics (VOPC) have been integrated into both paediatric and based adult outpatient services due to a multitude of factors, including increased demand for services, technological advances and rising morbidity secondary to ageing populations. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has accentuated pressures on the National Health Service (NHS) infrastructure, particularly elective services, whilst radically altering patterns of practice. AIM: To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric otolaryngology outpatient services whilst collating patient feedback to elicit long-term sustainability post COVID-19. METHOD: A retrospective analysis of VOPCs was undertaken at a tertiary paediatric referral centre over a 3-month capture period during the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographic, generic clinic (presenting complaint, new vs. follow-up, consultation type), as well as outcome data (medical or surgical intervention, discharge vs. ongoing review, onward referral, investigations, and conversion to face-to-face) was collated. Additionally a modified 15-point patient satisfaction survey was created. The Paediatric Otolaryngology Telemedicine Satisfaction survey (POTSS), was an adaptation of 4 validated patient satisfaction tools including the General Medical Council (GMC) patient questionnaire, the telehealth satisfaction scale (TESS), the telehealth usability questionnaire (TUQ), and the telemedicine satisfaction and usefulness questionnaire (TSUQ). RESULTS: Of 514 patients reviewed virtually over a 3-month period, 225 (45%) were randomly selected to participate, of which 200 met our inclusion criteria. The most common mode of consultation was telephony (92.5%, n = 185). Non-attendance rates were reduced when compared to face-to-face clinics during an equivalent period prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant proportion of patients (29% compared to 26% pre-VOPC) were discharged to primary care. Nine percent were listed for surgery compared to 19% pre-VOPC. A subsequent face-to-face appointment was required in 10% of participants. Overall, the satisfaction when assessing the doctor-patient relationship, privacy & trust, as well as consultation domains was high, with the overwhelming majority of parents' content with the future integration and participation in VOPCs. CONCLUSION: An evolving worldwide pandemic has accelerated the need for healthcare services to reform in order to maintain a steady flow of patients within an elective outpatient setting without compromising patient care. Solutions must be sustainable long-term to account for future disruptions, whilst accounting for evolving patient demographics. Our novel survey has demonstrated the vast potential that the integration of VOPCs can offer paediatric otolaryngology services within a carefully selected cohort of patients.","Darr, Adnan; Senior, Andrew; Argyriou, Kalliopi; Limbrick, Jack; Nie, Huimin; Kantczak, Ada; Stephenson, Kate; Parmar, Amit; Grainger, Joe",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,,447

With this communication, we expand the spectrum of PNS manifestations of Covid-19 infection by reporting an association of steroid responsive diffuse anterior horn cell disease with Covid-19 infection from a tertiary care centre in India. Neurological manifestations of Covid-19 are diverse, and our case which to best of my knowledge is the first case in literature to report an occurrence of steroid responsive diffuse anterior horn cell disease associated with Covid-19 infection, adds to the ever-increasing spectrum of neurological manifestations associated with this pandemic causing virus. Good response to steroid in our case serves to provide an insight into the possible pathogenesis of this manifestation and also paves the way for future therapeutic decisions related to this association.","Nanda, Satyan; Handa, Rahul; Anand, Rajiv; Prasad, Atul; Zutshi, Dhruv; Sharma, Bipan; Dass, Sujata K; Bedi, Prabhjeet Kaur; Pahuja, Aarti; Shah, Pankaj Kumar; Malhotra, Nalin",Neurol. sci,,447

It is considered a promising and safe alternative pain therapy. Different targets have been tested, each having their own particular mechanisms for modulating pain perception. AREAS COVERED: We discuss the current state of the art of tDCS to manage pain and future strategies to optimize tDCS' effects. Current strategies include primary motor cortex tDCS, prefrontal tDCS and tDCS combined with behavioral interventions while future strategies, on the other hand, include high intensity tDCS, transcutaneous Spinal Direct Current Stimulation, cerebellar tDCS, home-based tDCS and tDCS with extended number of sessions. EXPERT COMMENTARY: It has been shown that the stimulation of the prefrontal and primary motor cortex is efficient for pain reduction while a few other new strategies, such as high intensity tDCS and network-based tDCS, are believed to induce strong neuroplastic effects, although the underlying neural mechanisms still need to be fully uncovered. Hence, conventional tDCS approaches demonstrated promising effects to manage pain and new strategies are under development to enhance tDCS effects and make this approach more easily available by using, for instance, home-based devices.","Pacheco-Barrios, Kevin; Cardenas-Rojas, Alejandra; Thibaut, Aurore; Costa, Beatriz; Ferreira, Isadora; Caumo, Wolnei; Fregni, Felipe",,,447

470745,Social ‘bubbles’ unlikely to be allowed in UK soon,2020,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality after viral infections, including influenza A virus H1N1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. The angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key host membrane-bound protein that modulates ALI induced by viral infection, pulmonary acid aspiration, and sepsis. However, the contributions of ACE2 sequence variants to individual differences in disease risk and severity after viral infection are not understood. In this study, we quantified H1N1 influenza-infected lung transcriptomes across a family of 41 BXD recombinant inbred strains of mice and both parents-C57BL/6J and DBA/2J. In response to infection Ace2 mRNA levels decreased significantly for both parental strains and the expression levels was associated with disease severity (body weight loss) and viral load (expression levels of viral NA segment) across the BXD family members. Pulmonary RNA-seq for 43 lines was analyzed using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and Bayesian network approaches. Ace2 not only participated in virus-induced ALI by interacting with TNF, MAPK, and NOTCH signaling pathways, but was also linked with high confidence to gene products that have important functions in the pulmonary epithelium, including Rnf128, Muc5b, and Tmprss2. Comparable sets of transcripts were also highlighted in parallel studies of human SARS-CoV-infected primary human airway epithelial cells. Using conventional mapping methods, we determined that weight loss at two and three days after viral infection maps to chromosome X-the location of Ace2. This finding motivated the hierarchical Bayesian network analysis, which defined molecular endophenotypes of lung infection linked to Ace2 expression and to a key disease outcome. Core members of this Bayesian network include Ace2, Atf4, Csf2, Cxcl2, Lif, Maml3, Muc5b, Reg3g, Ripk3, and Traf3. Collectively, these findings define a causally-rooted Ace2 modulatory network relevant to host response to viral infection and identify potential therapeutic targets for virus-induced respiratory diseases, including those caused by influenza and coronaviruses.","Xu, Fuyi; Gao, Jun; Bergmann, Silke; Sims, Amy C; Ashbrook, David G; Baric, Ralph S; Cui, Yan; Jonsson, Colleen B; Li, Kui; Williams, Robert W; Schughart, Klaus; Lu, Lu",Front Immunol,,447

474039,Recycling waste plastics in roads: A life-cycle assessment study using primary data,2020,"BACKGROUND: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic. As a response, the United States shut down public gatherings and businesses in an effort to quarantine. This included the stopping of elective operations, which greatly affected plastic surgeons and their practices during the initial shutdown. OBJECTIVES: We aim to study the early impact of COVID-19 on the financial implications and practice patterns of plastic surgeons in the state of California during the initial shutdown of elective surgery and provide guidelines for effective management during future crises. METHODS: A 20-question survey was sent using Qualtrics XM software to 851 surgeon members of the California Society of Plastic Surgeons. The survey was open from May 13, 2020, to May 29, 2020. Standard statistical analysis was completed to compare private practice and nonprivate practice plastic surgeons. RESULTS: We had a total of 140 respondents to our survey for a 16.5% response rate. The majority (77.1%) of the respondents were in a private practice setting. Private practice plastic surgeons reported a higher financial impact with a 79% reduction in financial income compared with nonprivate practice plastic surgeons at a 37% reduction (P < 0.0001). Additionally, private practice plastic surgeons demonstrated a higher reduction in case volume and were more likely to lay off or furlough staff, close their practice, and apply for loans (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our survey study showed that private practice plastic surgeons in the state of California faced the most financial hardship during the early shutdown of the COVID-19 pandemic. It serves as a valuable snapshot in our economic history and depicts the heavy financial impact of the stopping of elective surgery. Since the reopening of practices, new guidelines have been implemented to maintain safe elective surgery while the pandemic continues. Further follow-up studies on both the state and national level need to be completed to see the continued financial effects on private and nonprivate plastic surgery practices since the reopening and resumption of elective surgery.","Crowley, Jiwon Sarah; Reghunathan, Meera; Kadakia, Nikita; Barttelbort, Scott; Gosman, Amanda",Ann Plast Surg,,447

486035,"Ein aktueller Schwerpunkt, eine gute Neuigkeit und ein dankbares ""Adieu""",2020,"The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are heterogeneous: 46.4% of patients admitted into hospital reported to have at least one comorbidity. Comorbidities such as COPD, diabetes, hypertension and malignancy predispose patients with Covid-19 to adverse clinical outcomes. Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder caused by pathological mutation(s) in the SERPINA1 gene resulting in an imbalance in proteinase activity which may lead to premature emphysema and COPD. Our aim was to investigate whether people with severe AAT deficiency (AATD) have an increased risk of (severe) COVID-19 infection. We collected data on COVID-19 symptoms, laboratory-confirmed infection, hospitalization and treatment by means of a telephone survey, directly administered to Italian severe AATD subjects in May 2020. We then compared our findings with data collected by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità on the total population in Italy during the same period. We found an higher frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort (3.8%) compared to national data regarding infection, thus giving severe AATD a relative risk of 8. 8 (95%CI 5.1-20,0; p<0.0001) for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, the relative risk (RR) was higher in AATD patients with pre-existing lung diseases (RR 13.9; 95%CI 8.0-33.6; p<0.001), but with a similar death rate (1 in 8, 12.5%) compared to the general population (13.9%; RR 0.9). These preliminary findings highlight the importance of close surveillance in the spread of COVID-19 in patients with severe AATD and underlines the need for further studies into the role of the antiprotease shield in preventing SARS-Cov-2 infection.","Ferrarotti, I; Ottaviani, S; Balderacchi, A M; Barzon, V; De Silvestri, A; Piloni, D; Mariani, F; Corsico, A G",Respir Med,,447

With the United States leading the path in terms of case incidence, it is important to investigate how weather variables influence the spread of the disease in the country. This paper assembles a detailed and comprehensive dataset comprising COVID-19 cases and climatological variables for all counties in the continental U.S. and uses a developed econometric approach to estimate the causal effect of certain weather factors on the growth rate of infection. The results indicate a non-linear and significant negative relationship between the individual weather measures and the growth rate of COVID-19 in the U.S. Specifically, the paper finds that a 1 °C rise in daily temperature will reduce daily covid growth rate in the U.S. by approximately 6 percent in the following week, while a marginal increase in relative humidity reduces the same outcome by 1 percent over a similar period. In comparison, a 1 m/s increase in daily wind speed will bring about an 8 percent drop in daily growth rate of COVID-19 in the country. These results differ by location and are robust to several sensitivity checks, so large deviations are unexpected.","Emediegwu, Lotanna E",J Environ Manage,,447
487855,The Negative Impact of COVID-19 on Medical Education amongst Medical Students Interested in Plastic Surgery: A Cross-sectional Survey Study,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was declared a worldwide pandemic in 2020. Infection triggers the respiratory tract disease COVID-19, which is accompanied by serious changes in clinical biomarkers such as hemoglobin and interleukins. The same parameters are altered during hemolysis, which is characterized by an increase in labile heme. We present two computational-experimental approaches aimed at analyzing a potential link between heme-related and COVID-19 pathophysiologies. Herein, we performed a detailed analysis of the common pathways induced by heme and SARS-CoV-2 by superimposition of knowledge graphs covering heme biology and COVID-19 pathophysiology. Focus was laid on inflammatory pathways and distinct biomarkers as the linking elements. In a second approach, four COVID-19-related proteins, the host cell proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as well as the viral proteins 7a and S protein were computationally analyzed as potential heme-binding proteins with an experimental validation. The results contribute to the understanding of the progression of COVID-19 infections in patients with different clinical backgrounds and may allow for a more individual diagnosis and therapy in the future.","Hopp, M.

Here, we show that heparin and certain xylosides, which exhibit in vitro viral entry inhibitory properties against HSV-1, HSV-2, HPV-16, HPV-31, HVB, HVC, HIV-1, HTLV-1, SARS-CoV-2, HCMV, DENV-1, and DENV-2, stimulated HS biosynthesis at the cell surface 2- to 3-fold for heparin and up to 10-fold for such xylosides. This is consistent with the hypothesis from a previous study that for core protein attachment, viruses are glycosylated at HS attachment sites (i.e., serine residues intended to receive the D-xylose molecule for initiating HS chains). Heparanase overexpression, endocytic entry, and syndecan shedding enhancement, all of which are observed during viral infection, lead to glycocalyx deregulation and appear to be direct consequences of this hypothesis. In addition to the appearance of type 2 diabetes and the degradation of HS observed during viral infection, we linked this hypothesis to that proposed in a previous publication.","Cheudjeu, Antony",Life Sci,,447

We presented here a robust gene expression-based molecular classification of IDH wild-type diffuse LGG into two subtypes with distinct biological and clinical features. A discovery cohort of 49 IDH wild-type diffuse LGGs from Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) was subjected to clustering and function analysis. 73 tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used to validate our findings. Consensus clustering of transcriptional data uncovered concordant classification of two robust and prognostically significant subtypes of IDH wild-type LGG. Sub1, associated with poorer outcomes, was characterized by significantly higher immune, cytolytic scores, M2 macrophages and up-regulation of immune exhaustion markers; while Sub2 who had elevated lymphocytes and plasma cells showed relatively favorable survival. Somatic alteration analysis revealed Sub1 showed more frequently deleted regions, such as locus of CDKN2A/CDKN2B, DMRTA1, C9orf53 and MTAP. Furthermore, we developed and validated a five-gene signature for better application of this acquired stratification. Our data demonstrate the biological and prognostic heterogeneity within IDH wild-type diffuse LGGs and deepen our molecular understanding of this tumor entity. This article is protected by copyright.

The analysis provided an overview of the obesity field, highlighting major trends such as physiological conditions, age, and diet, as well as key well-studied genes, such as adiponectin and its receptor. By intersecting the DisGeNET knowledge with the ScanBious results, we deciphered four clusters of obesity-related genes. An initial set of 100+ thousand abstracts and 622 genes was reduced to 19 genes, distributed among just a few groups: heredity, inflammation, intercellular signaling, and cancer. Rapid profiling of articles could drive personalized medicine: if the disease signs of a particular person were superimposed on a general network, then it would be possible to understand which are non-specific (observed in cohorts and, therefore, most likely have known treatment solutions) and which are less investigated, and probably represent a personalized case.","Tarbeeva, Svetlana; Lyamtseva, Ekaterina; Lisitsa, Andrey; Kozlova, Anna; Ponomarenko, Elena; Ilgisonis, Ekaterina",,,447

Additionally, we assessed the utility of a screening tool in predicting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing results in our cohort. METHODS: This was an observational study in which all women who were scheduled for a planned delivery within the Mount Sinai Health system from April 4 to April 15, 2020, were contacted and provided with an appointment for themselves as well as their support persons to undergo COVID-19 testing 1 day before their scheduled delivery. Both the patients and the support persons were administered a standardized screen specific for COVID-19 infection by telephone interview. Those support persons who screened positive were not permitted to attend the birth. All patients and screen-negative support persons underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. RESULTS: During the study period, 155 patients and 146 support persons underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. The prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection was 15.5% (CI 9.8-21.2%) and 9.6% (CI 4.8-14.4%) among patients and support persons, respectively. The rate of discordance among tested pairs was 7.5%. Among patients with COVID-19 infection, 58% of their support persons also had infection; in patients without infection, fewer than 3.0% of their support persons had infection. CONCLUSION: We found that more than 15% of asymptomatic maternity patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection despite having screened negative with the use of a telephone screening tool. Additionally, 58% of their asymptomatic, screen-negative support persons also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Alternatively, testing of the support persons of women who had tested negative for COVID-19 infection had a low yield for positive results. This has important implications for obstetric and newborn care practices as well as for health care professionals.","Bianco, Angela; Buckley, Ayisha B; Overbey, Jessica; Smilen, Scott; Wagner, Brian; Dinglas, Cheryl; Loudon, Holly; Garely, Alan; Brodman, Michael; Stone, Joanne",Obstet Gynecol,,447

518607,Wie erleben Pflegefachpersonen die Corona-Pandemie?,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is considered the most sensitive method for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, this method is relatively resource- and time-consuming. This study was performed to compare SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (N-Ag) testing using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. METHODS: Parallel SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and quantitative N-Ag ELISA analysis was executed on nasopharyngeal specimens obtained during SARS-CoV-2 screening in a cohort of pre-hospitalization patients. RESULTS: In total, 277 specimens were examined, including 182 (65.7%) RT-PCR-positive specimens, which demonstrated a median cycle threshold (Ct) value of 27 (interquartile range (IQR) 23-35). The SARS-CoV-2 N-Ag was detected in 164 of the 182 RT-PCR-positive specimens (overall sensitivity 90.1%). Among the 95 RT-PCR-negative specimens, 72 were N-Ag-negative (specificity 75.8%). SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and N-Ag ELISA results demonstrated a strong agreement (Cramer's V = 0.668; P < 0.001). N-Ag concentrations spanned from 5.4 to 296 000 pg/ml (median 901 pg/ml, IQR 43-1407 pg/ml) and were inversely correlated with Ct values (Spearman's r = -0.720; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 N-Ag ELISA results were in close agreement with RT-PCR results, and N-Ag concentrations were proportional to viral loads. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 quantitative antigen testing could be an additional diagnostic instrument for SARS-CoV-2.","Mayanskiy, Nikolay; Brzhozovskaya, Ekaterina; Fedorova, Natalia; Lebedin, Yuri",Int J Infect Dis,,447

We aimed to assess vaccine uptake in these communities and identify characteristics that might impact uptake. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting and Participants AL/RC communities in the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program that had ≥ 1 on-site vaccination clinic during December 18, 2020 – April 21, 2021. Methods We estimated uptake by using the cumulative number of doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered and normalizing by the number of AL/RC community beds. We estimated the percentage of residents vaccinated in three states using AL census counts. We linked community vaccine administration data with county-level social vulnerability index (SVI) measures to calculate median vaccine uptake by SVI tertile. Results In AL communities, a median of 67 residents (IQR: 48–90) and 32 staff members (IQR: 15–60) per 100 beds received a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine at the first on-site clinic; in RC, a median of 8 residents (IQR: 5–10) and 5 staff members (IQR: 2–12) per 10 beds received a first dose. Among three states with available AL resident census data, median resident first-dose uptake at the first clinic was 93% (IQR: 85–108) in Connecticut, 85% in Georgia (IQR: 70–102), and 78% (IQR: 56–91) in Tennessee. Among both residents and staff, cumulative first-dose vaccine uptake increased with increasing social vulnerability related to housing type and transportation. Conclusions and Implications COVID-19 vaccination of residents and staff in LTCFs is a public health priority. On-site clinics may help to increase vaccine uptake, particularly when transportation may be a barrier. Ensuring steady access to COVID-19 vaccine in LTCFs following the conclusion of the Pharmacy Partnership is critical to maintaining high vaccination coverage among residents and staff.","Gharpure, Radhika; Yi, Sarah H.; Li, Ruoran; Jacobs Slifka, Kara M.; Tippins, Ashley; Jaffe, Aaron; Guo, Angela; Kent, Alyssa G.; Gouin, Katryna A.; Whitworth, J.

The government thus has the reasonability to address most of the sources that were highlighted (long working hours, lack of proper equipment, lack of sleep, exhaustion, and experiencing high death rate under their care). Further, the Ugandan social fabric presents an opportunity for coping through its strong communal links and networks.

We have updated an enterovirus assay and combined it with a previously published assay for human parechovirus resulting in a multiplex one-step RT-PCR assay. The multiplex assay was validated by analysing the sensitivity and specificity of the assay compared to the respective monoplex assays, and a good concordance was found. Furthermore, the enterovirus assay was able to detect 42 reference strains from all 4 species, and an additional 9 genotypes during panel testing and routine usage. During 15 months of routine use, from October 2008 to December 2009, we received and analysed 2187 samples (stool samples, cerebrospinal fluids, blood samples, respiratory samples and autopsy samples) were tested, from 1546 patients and detected enteroviruses and parechoviruses in 171 (8%) and 66 (3%) of the samples, respectively. 180 of the positive samples could be genotyped by PCR and sequencing and the most common genotypes found were human parechovirus type 3, echovirus 9, enterovirus 71, Coxsackievirus A16, and echovirus 25. During 2009 in Denmark, both enterovirus and human parechovirus type 3 had a similar seasonal pattern with a peak during the summer and autumn. Human parechovirus type 3 was almost invariably found in children less than 4 months of age. In conclusion, a multiplex assay was developed allowing simultaneous detection of 2 viruses, which can cause similar clinical symptoms.","Nielsen, Alex Christian Yde; Böttiger, Blenda; Midgley, Sofie Elisabeth; Nielsen, Lars Peter",J Virol Methods,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2013.06.038; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166093413002528; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23845901/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166093413002528,447

Lung involvement is associated with high morbidity and mortality, so it requires early appropriate treatment. Chest computed tomography (CT) and the analysis of biologic specimens are the first line diagnostic tools in these patients, and sometimes invasive methods are necessary. Interpreting the images requires an analysis of the clinical context, which is often complex. Starting from the knowledge about the differential diagnosis of lung findings that radiologists acquire during training, this article aims to explain the key clinical and radiological aspects that make it possible to orient the diagnosis correctly and to understand the current role of CT in the treatment strategy for this group of patients.","Calvillo Batllés, P.; Carreres Polo, J.; Sanz Caballer, J.; Salavert Lletí, M.; Compte Torrero, L.",Radiologia,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033833815001241; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033833815001241,447

Similar to other viruses, CoVs are dependent on host factors for their survival and replication. We hypothesized that evolutionarily distinct CoVs may exploit similar host factors and pathways to support their replication cycle. Here, we conducted two independent genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens to identify pan-CoV host factors required for the replication of both endemic and emerging CoVs, including the novel CoV SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, we found that several autophagy-related genes, including the immunophilin FKBP8, TMEM41B, and MINAR1, were common host factors required for CoV replication. Importantly, inhibition of the immunophilin family with the compounds Tacrolimus, Cyclosporin A, and the non-immunosuppressive derivative Alisporivir, resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of CoV replication in primary human nasal epithelial cell cultures that resemble the natural site of virus replication. Overall, we identified host factors that are crucial for CoV replication and demonstrate that these factors constitute potential targets for therapeutic intervention by clinically approved drugs.","Kratzel, Annika; Kelly, Jenna N.; Brueggemann, Yannick; Portmann, Jasmine; V’kovski, Philip; Todt, Daniel; Ebert, Nadine; Steinmann, Eike; Dijkman, Ronald; Zimmer, Gert; Pfaender, Stephanie; Thiel, Volker",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.24.432634,447
599612,Corona-Pandemie und die Stabilität des Bankensystems: Ursachen in der Realwirtschaft kurieren,2020-11-20,"Bats are associated with several important zoonotic viruses from different families. One example includes adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), that are extensively detected in several animals, especially primates. To understand AAVs distribution and genetic diversity in the coastal areas of Southeast China, a total of 415 intestine samples were mostly collected from two provinces of southeast China, i.e., Zhejiang and Fujian province. Intestine samples from five bat species were collected for AAVs detection. The average prevalence rate for AAV detection among these samples was 18.6% (77 positives out of 415 samples) and ranged from 11.8 to 28.9% between the five bat species. This suggests that AAVs are widely distributed in diverse bat populations in southeast coastal areas of China. Based on the genome sequence of bat adeno-associated virus-CXC1(BtAAV-CXC1) from one AAV-positive sample, the genetic diversity of the detected AAVs were assessed and analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that BtAAV-CXC1 was comparatively distant to other major AAVs from mammals and non-mammals, with only a 52.9~64.7% nucleotide identity. However, they were phylogenetically closer to Rhinolophus sinicus bat adeno-associated virus (Rs-BtAAV1), with a 74.5% nt similarity. Partial analysis of the rep and cap overlapping open reading frame (ORF) sequences from bat AAV samples revealed 48 partial rep sequences and 23 partial cap sequences from positive samples shared 86.9 to 100% and 72.3 to 98.8% nucleotide identities among themselves, respectively. This suggests that the detected AAVs had a distinctly high genetic diversity. These findings led us to conclude that diverse AAVs may be widely distributed in bat populations from the southeast regions of China.","Zhu, Changqiang; Wang, Chunhui; Wu, Jiahong; Ye, Fuqiang; Lv, Ruichen; Hu, Dan; Ai, Lele; Yang, Lu; Wu, Ting; Li, Bo; Ding, Chenxi; Zhang, Bin; Lv, Heng; Wang, Changjun; Tan, Weilong",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32111911/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-60721-z,447

Countries around the globe had a variable initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic from imposing massive lock downs and quarantine to surrendering to herd immunity. However, healthcare bodies worldwide recognized early on that a triumph against COVID-19 could only be achieved by maintaining the infrastructure of healthcare systems and their capacity to accommodate a potentially overwhelming increase in critical patient care needs. Therefore, they reacted by restricting medical care to emergency cases and postponing elective surgical procedures in all disciplines. The priority was made for treatment of COVID-19 patients and emergency cases. Nevertheless, the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing. In the absence of vaccines or effective drug treatments, its timeline remains uncertain and it cannot be forecast how long healthcare systems will need to cope with it in managing inpatient and outpatient services. Accordingly, extreme measures and restriction may become a recipe for a disaster in the context of the potential adverse health implications imposed by delaying timely medical and surgical care. Therefore, restrictive measures should be substituted with a comprehensive surgical and medical care strategy. One that provides a safe balance between the prevention of COVID-19 and the delivery of essential surgical care.

611846,"Tuberkulose - Wann daran denken, wie diagnostizieren?",2021-06-24,"The ability to accurately and consistently discover anomalies in time series is important in many applications. Fields such as finance (fraud detection), information security (intrusion detection), healthcare, and others all benefit from anomaly detection. Intuitively, anomalies in time series are time points or sequences of time points that deviate from normal behavior characterized by periodic oscillations and long-term trends. For example, the typical activity on e-commerce websites exhibits weekly periodicity and grows steadily before holidays. Similarly, domestic usage of electricity exhibits daily and weekly oscillations combined with long-term season-dependent trends. How can we accurately detect anomalies in such domains while simultaneously learning a model for normal behavior? We propose a robust offline unsupervised framework for anomaly detection in seasonal multivariate time series, called AURORA. A key innovation in our framework is a general background behavior model that unifies periodicity and long-term trends. To this end, we leverage a Ramanujan periodic dictionary and a spline-based dictionary to capture both seasonal and trend patterns. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. AURORA has significant advantages over existing models for anomaly detection, including high accuracy (AUC of up to 0.98), interpretability of recovered normal behavior ([Formula: see text] accuracy in period detection), and the ability to detect both point and contextual anomalies. In addition, AURORA is orders of magnitude faster than baselines.","Zhang, Lin; Zhang, Wenyu; McNeil, Maxwell J.; Chengwang, Nachuan; Matteson, David S.; Bogdanov, Petko",Data Min Knowl Discov,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10618-021-00771-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177356/,447

Eligible adults (n = 128) were asked about virtual rave and happy hour attendance during the COVID-19 crisis. We examined prevalence and correlates of drug use during such events. RESULTS: 55.5% of participants attended virtual raves and 69.5% attended virtual happy hours. 40.9% used illegal drugs during virtual raves and the most frequently used drugs were cannabis (29.6%), ecstasy/MDMA/Molly (8.5%), LSD (7.0%), and cocaine (4.2%). 33.7% used illegal drugs during virtual happy hours and the most frequently used drugs were cannabis (29.2%), cocaine (3.4%), and ketamine (3.4%).

The aim of this study was to analyze the pattern of inflammatory biomarkers in SCD febrile children and controls, in order to determine predictors of severe bacterial infection (SBI). METHODS: A prospective, case–control study was carried out during 3 years, including patients younger than 18 years with SCD and fever (cases) and asymptomatic steady-state SCD children (controls). Clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters, including 10 serum proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17a, IFN-γ and TNF-α) and comparisons among study subgroups were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 137 patients (79 cases and 58 controls) were included in the study; 78.5% males, median age 4.1 (1.7–7.5) years. Four cases were diagnosed with SBI, 41 viral infection (VI), 33 no proven infection (NPI) and 1 bacterial-viral coinfection (the latter excluded from the subanalyses). IL-6 was significantly higher in patients with SBI than in patients with VI or NPI (163 vs 0.7 vs 0.7 pg/ml, p < 0.001), and undetectable in all controls. The rest of the cytokines analyzed did not show any significant difference. The optimal cut-off value of IL-6 for the diagnosis of SBI was 125 pg/mL, with high PPV and NPV (PPV of 100% for a prevalence rate of 5, 10 and 15% and NPV of 98.7%, 97.3% and 95.8% for those prevalences rates, respectively). CONCLUSION: We found that IL-6 (with a cut-off value of 125 pg/ml) was an optimal marker for SBI in this cohort of febrile SCD children, with high PPV and NPV. Therefore, given its rapid elevation, IL-6 may be useful to early discriminate SCD children at risk of SBI, in order to guide their management.

Widening of healthcare disparities is expected as the gap between health systems with and without adequate resources to mitigate the pandemic become more apparent. We undertook a bibliometric analysis of research related to cancer and COVID-19 to understand (1) the type of research that has been conducted (e.g. patients, services and systems) and (2) whether the pandemic has impacted the state of global cancer research as measured by research outputs to date. METHODS: An existing filter for cancer research consisting of title words and the names of specialist cancer journals was used to identify cancer and COVID-19 related articles and reviews in the Web of Science (©Clarivate Analytics) between January 2019 and February 2021. RESULTS: One thousand five hundred and forty-five publications were identified. The majority (57%) were reviews, opinion pieces or concerned with modelling impact of delays to diagnosis and treatment. The main research domains focused on managing or estimating COVID-19 risk to cancer patients accounting for 384 papers (25%).

Evidence regarding the potential benefit of early administration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) therapy in symptomatic patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is not clear. METHODS: This observational prospective cohort study took place in 238 ambulatory fever clinics in Saudi Arabia, which followed the Ministry of Health (MOH) COVID-19 treatment guideline. This guideline included multiple treatment options for COVID-19 based on the best available evidence at the time, among which was Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Patients with confirmed COVD-19 (by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test) who presented to these clinics with mild to moderate symptoms during the period from 5-26 June 2020 were included in this study. Our study looked at those who received HCQ-based therapy along with supportive care (SC) and compared them to patients who received SC alone. The primary outcome was hospital admission within 28-days of presentation. The secondary outcome was a composite of intensive care admission (ICU) and/or mortality during the follow-up period. Outcome data were assessed through a follow-up telephonic questionnaire at day 28 and were further verified with national hospitalisation and mortality registries. Multiple logistic regression model was used to control for prespecified confounders. RESULTS: Of the 7,892 symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients who visited the ambulatory fever clinics during the study period, 5,541 had verified clinical outcomes at day 28 (1,817 patients in the HCQ group vs 3,724 in the SC group). At baseline, patients who received HCQ therapy were more likely to be males who did not have hypertension or chronic lung disease compared to the SC group. No major differences were noted regarding other comorbid conditions. All patients were presenting with active complaints; however, the HCQ groups had higher rates of symptoms compared to the SC group (fever: 84% vs 66.3, headache: 49.8 vs 37.4, cough: 44.5 vs 35.6, respectively). Early HCQ-based therapy was associated with a lower hospital admission within 28-days compared to SC alone (9.4% compared to 16.6%, RRR 43%, p-value <0.001). The composite outcome of ICU admission and/or mortality at 28-days was also lower in the HCQ group compared to the SC (1.2% compared to 2.6%, RRR 54%, p-value 0.001). Adjusting for age, gender, and major comorbid conditions, a multivariate logistic regression model showed a decrease in the odds of hospitalisation in patients who received HCQ compared to SC alone (adjusted OR 0.57 [95% CI 0.47-0.69], p-value <0.001). The composite outcome of ICU admission and/or mortality was also lower for the HCQ group compared to the SC group controlling for potential confounders (adjusted OR 0.55 [95% CI 0.34-0.91], p-value 0.019). CONCLUSION: Early intervention with HCQ-based therapy in patients with mild to moderate symptoms at presentation is associated with lower adverse clinical outcomes among COVID-19 patients, including hospital admissions, ICU admission, and/or death.","Sulaiman, T.; Mohana, A.; Alawdah, L.; Mahmoud, N.; Hassanein, M.; Wani, T.; Alfaifi, A.; Alenazi, E.; Radwan, N.; AlKhalifah, N.; Elkady, E.; AlAnazi, M.; Alqahtani, M.; Abdalla, K.; Yousif, Y.; AboGazalah, F.; Awwad, F.; AlabdulKareem, K.; AlGhofaili, F.; AlJedai, A.; Jokhdar, H.; Alrabiah, F.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.09.20184143; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.09.20184143v1?rss=1,447

There are several commercial ad hoc molecular diagnostic kits currently on the market, many of which have been evaluated by different groups. However, in low resource settings the availability and cost of these commercial kits can be a limiting factor for many diagnostic laboratories. In such cases alternatives need to be identified. With this in mind, eight commercial reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) master mixes from Applied Biosystems (Thermo Fisher Scientific), Bio-Rad, Biotech Rabbit, Promega, Qiagen, QuantaBio, Invitrogen (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Takara using the same commercial primer and probe mix [LightMix® Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene mix (TIB MolBiol, Germany)] were evaluated.

The limit of detection was calculated for each assay using serial dilutions of a defined clinical sample. The performances of the assays were compared using a panel of 178 clinical samples and their analytical specificity assessed against a panel of human betacoronaviruses. Inter assay agreement was assessed using statistical tests (Bland-Altman, Fleiss-Kappa and Cohen’s Kappa) and was shown to be excellent to good in all cases.

That argument will no doubt continue. But we argue that one consequence is already evident: the United States has spent the last seventy years portraying itself as a security provider in all key domains—for many an intrinsic component of its status as a global leader. One reasonable broad conclusion from the US struggle with COVID-19 is that it has further forfeited its broad leadership position on the basis of its behaviour. Yet that, although possibly true, would only portray one element of the story. The more profound insight exposed by COVID-19 is of a new reality: in a world where both naturogenic and anthropogenic threats pose immense national security challenges, decades of mistaken assumptions and policy choices have created a new environment, one where the United States has been redefined as a security consumer, at least in terms of international public health issues associated with the spread of deadly infectious diseases.","Reich, Simon; Dombrowski, Peter",Int Aff,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191869/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiaa136,447

CASE SUMMARY: a 71-year-old patient presented to the emergency department with acute respiratory failure. The patient had been discharged from the hospital 1 day before, after apparent recovery of a proven COVID-19 infection. Relevant medical history reports polycythemia vera. The diagnostic work-up included a CT-scan of the thorax, revealing bilateral sub-segmental pulmonary embolism. An echocardiogram showed a dilated right ventricle with poor systolic function and a large multi-lobar thrombus. Forty-eight hours after initiation of treatment with therapeutic anticoagulation the thrombus was no longer seen on the echocardiogram. DISCUSSION: This case confirms the high risk of thrombosis in COVID-19 infection as has been described in recent literature. It demonstrates the severity of the coagulopathy given the presence of both bilateral sub-segmental pulmonary embolism and right ventricular thrombus, despite treatment with prophylactic anticoagulation. Remarkable in this case is the fact that the patient had a myeloproliferative neoplasm (polycythaemia vera). This is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, especially in the presence of erythrocytosis, leucocytosis, and/or inflammation.","Vervaat, Fabienne E; Houthuizen, Patrick",Eur Heart J Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33623859/,447

Comorbid diseases are a key explanatory factor behind COVID-19 mortality, but current studies treat comorbidities in isolation, at average-population values, and rarely assess how death risk varies for different health profiles across institutions. Estimating death risk variations for different interactions between comorbid diseases and across healthcare institutions is crucial to gaining a significant depth of understanding in relation to mortality during the pandemic. Methods This study relies on data from approximately half a million people in Mexico (of all recorded cases through August 15, 2020) and on Bayesian estimation to provide a more robust estimate of the combined effect of several comorbidities and institutional inequalities upon COVID-19 mortality. Results The findings of the study illustrate the additive effects of several comorbid diseases with the presence of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and CKD increasing the mortality risk of COVID-19. There are also variations in risk of death across the heterogeneous Mexican health system. Conclusions This study shows that COVID-19 mortality risk sharply increases in patients with 2 or more comorbid diseases (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases) in Mexico. However, death risk varied significantly across institutions for patients with the same comorbidity profile.","Najera, Hector; Ortega-Avila, Ana G.",Am J Prev Med,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0749379720305122; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379720305122?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33745520/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2020.10.015,447

Biological properties of ASFV indicate that the African swine fever (ASF) pandemic will continue to develop and that only the implementation of an effective and safe vaccine will ensure a reduction in the spread of ASFV. At present, vaccines against ASF are not available. The latest approaches to the ASFV vaccine’s design concentrate on the development of either modified live vaccines by targeted gene deletion from different isolates or subunit vaccines. The construction of an effective vaccine is hindered by the complex structure of the virus, the lack of an effective continuous cell line for the isolation and propagation of ASFV, unpredictable and stain-specific phenotypes after the genetic modification of ASFV, a risk of reversion to virulence, and our current inability to differentiate infected animals from vaccinated ones. Moreover, the design of vaccines intended for wild boars and oral administration is desirable. Despite several obstacles, the design of a safe and effective vaccine against ASFV seems to be achievable.","Turlewicz-Podbielska, Hanna; Kuriga, Anna; Niemyjski, Rafał; Tarasiuk, Grzegorz; Pomorska-Mól, Małgorzata",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v13071212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201761/,447

The recommended temperature for storage of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs ranges between 2-30 °C. In the global South, mean temperatures can exceed 30 °C. In the global North, Ag-RDTs are often used in external testing facilities at low ambient temperatures. We assessed analytical sensitivity and specificity of eleven commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using different storage and operational temperatures, including short- or long-term storage and operation at recommended temperatures or at either 2-4 °C or at 37 °C. The limits of detection of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs under recommended conditions ranged from 1.0 × 10(6)-5.5 × 10(7) genome copies/ml of infectious SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant. Despite long-term storage at recommended conditions, 10 minutes pre-incubation of Ag-RDTs and testing at 37 °C resulted in about ten-fold reduced sensitivity for five out of 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, including both Ag-RDTs currently listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization. After 3 weeks of storage at 37 °C, eight of the 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs exhibited about ten-fold reduced sensitivity. Specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using cell culture supernatant from common respiratory viruses was not affected by storage and testing at 37 °C, whereas false-positive results occurred at outside temperatures of 2-4 °C for two out of six tested Ag-RDTs. In summary, elevated temperatures impair sensitivity, whereas low temperatures impair specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs. Consequences may include false-negative test results at clinically relevant virus concentrations compatible with inter-individual transmission and false-positive results entailing unwarranted quarantine assignments. Storage and operation of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs at recommended conditions is essential for successful usage during the pandemic.","Haage, Verena; de Oliveira-Filho, Edmilson Ferreira; Moreira-Soto, Andres; Kühne, Arne; Fischer, Carlo; Sacks, Jilian A.; Corman, Victor Max; Müller, Marcel A.; Drosten, Christian; Drexler, Jan Felix",J Clin Virol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653221000639; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33773413/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653221000639?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2021.104796,447

Characterization of the genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial in following and evaluating it spread across countries. In this study, we collected and analyzed 3,067 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from 55 countries during the first three months after the onset of this virus. Using comparative genomics analysis, we traced the profiles of the whole-genome mutations and compared the frequency of each mutation in the studied population. The accumulation of mutations during the epidemic period with their geographic locations was also monitored. The results showed 782 variants sites, of which 512 (65.47%) had a non-synonymous effect. Frequencies of mutated alleles revealed the presence of 68 recurrent mutations, including ten hotspot non-synonymous mutations with a prevalence higher than 0.10 in this population and distributed in six SARS-CoV-2 genes. The distribution of these recurrent mutations on the world map revealed that certain genotypes are specific to geographic locations. We also identified co-occurring mutations resulting in the presence of several haplotypes. Moreover, evolution over time has shown a mechanism of mutation co-accumulation which might affect the severity and spread of the SARS-CoV-2. The phylogentic analysis identified two major Clades C1 and C2 harboring mutations L3606F and G614D, respectively and both emerging for the first time in China. On the other hand, analysis of the selective pressure revealed the presence of negatively selected residues that could be taken into considerations as therapeutic targets. We have also created an inclusive unified database (http://covid-19.medbiotech.ma) that lists all of the genetic variants of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes found in this study with phylogeographic analysis around the world.","Laamarti, Meriem; Alouane, Tarek; Kartti, Souad; Chemao-Elfihri, M.

The primary mode of viral transmission is droplet transmission through direct contact with large droplets generated during breathing, talking, coughing, and sneezing. However, the virus can also demonstrate airborne transmission through smaller droplets (< 5 μm in diameter) generated during various medical procedures, collectively termed aerosol-generating procedures. The aim of this study was to analyze droplet contamination of healthcare workers and splatter patterns in the operating theater that resulted from endoscopic transnasal procedures in noninfected patients. METHODS A prospective nonrandomized microscopic evaluation of contaminants generated during 10 endoscopic transnasal procedures performed from May 14 to June 11, 2020, in the same operating theater was carried out. A dilution of monosodium fluorescein, repeatedly instilled through nasal irrigation, was used as a marker of contaminants generated during surgical procedures. Contaminants were collected on detectors worn by healthcare workers and placed in standard points in the operating theater. Analysis of number, dimensions, and characteristics of contaminants was carried out with fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS A total of 70 samples collected from 10 surgical procedures were analyzed. Liquid droplets and solid-tissue fragments were identified as contaminants on all detectors analyzed. All healthcare workers appeared to have been exposed to a significant number of contaminants. A significant degree of contamination was observed in every site of the operating room. The mean (range) diameter of liquid droplets was 4.1 (1.0-26.6) μm and that of solid fragments was 23.6 (3.5-263.3) μm. CONCLUSIONS Endoscopic endonasal surgery is associated with the generation of large amounts of contaminants, some of which measure less than 5 μm. All healthcare workers in the surgical room are exposed to a significant and similar risk of contamination; therefore, adequate personal protective equipment should be employed when performing endoscopic endonasal surgical procedures.","Russo, Federico; Valentini, Marco; Sabatino, Daniele; Cerati, Michele; Facco, Carla; Battaglia, Paolo; Turri-Zanoni, Mario; Castelnuovo, Paolo; Karligkiotis, Apostolos",Journal of neurosurgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34534965/; https://doi.org/10.3171/2021.3.jns204415,447

Innate and adaptive immune responses to OSEs play an important role in atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study was to develop novel human single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody specific to OSEs to image and inhibit atherosclerosis. RESULTS: Here, we screened a novel scFv antibody, named as ASA6, from phage-displayed human scFv library. ASA6 can bind to oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL) and atherosclerotic plaques. Meanwhile, ASA6 can also inhibit the uptake of Ox-LDL into macrophage to reduce macrophage apoptosis. The atherosclerotic lesion area of ApoE-/- mice administrated with ASA6 antibody was significantly reduced. Transcriptome analysis reveals the anti-atherosclerosis effect of ASA6 is related to the regulation of fatty acid metabolism and inhibition of M1 macrophage polarization. Moreover, we conjugated ASA6 antibody to NaNdF4@NaGdF4 nanoparticles for noninvasive imaging of atherosclerotic plaques by magnetic resonance (MR) and near-infrared window II (NIR-II) imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data demonstrate the potential of ASA6 antibody in targeted therapy and noninvasive imaging for atherosclerosis.","Zhang, Liwei; Xue, Sheng; Ren, Feng; Huang, Siyang; Zhou, Ruizhi; Wang, Yu; Zhou, Changyong; Li, Zhen",J Nanobiotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583680/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12951-021-01047-4,447

A feature of the LASSBio Chemical Library worth highlighting is the fact that it is a smart library designed by medicinal chemists with pharmacological activity as the main priority. The great majority of the compounds part of this library have shown in vivo activity in animal models, which is an indication that they possess overall favorable bioavailability properties and, hence, adequate pharmacokinetic profiles. This, in turn, is supported by the fact that approximately 85% of the compounds are compliant with Lipinski’s rule of five and ca. 95% are compliant with Veber’s rules, two important guidelines for oral bioavailability. In this work it is presented a virtual screening methodology combining a pharmacophore-based model and an empirical Gibbs free energy-based model for the ligand–protein interaction to explore the LASSBio Chemical Library as a source of new hits for the inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ (PI4KIIIβ) enzyme, which is related to the development of viral infections (including enteroviruses, SARS coronavirus, and hepatitis C virus), cancers and neurological diseases. The approach resulted in the identification of two hits, LASSBio-1799 (7) and LASSBio-1814 (10), which inhibited the target enzyme with IC(50) values of 3.66 μM and IC(50) and 6.09 μM, respectively.

These processes drive the accumulation of intracellular cyclic-di-nucleotides such as cyclic-di-GMP (CDG). Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are critical drivers of type 2 lung inflammation during fungal allergen exposure in mice; however, it is unclear how CDG regulates lung ILC responses during lung inflammation. Here, we show that intranasal CDG induced early airway type 1 interferon (IFN) production and dramatically suppressed CD127+ST2+ ILC2s and type 2 lung inflammation during Alternaria and IL-33 exposure. Further, CD127–ST2–Thy1.2+ lung ILCs, which showed a transcriptomic signature consistent with ILC1s, were expanded and activated by CDG combined with either Alternaria or IL-33. CDG-mediated suppression of type 2 inflammation occurred independent of IL-18R, IL-12, and STAT6 but required the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and type 1 IFN signaling. Thus, CDG potently suppresses ILC2-driven lung inflammation and promotes ILC1 responses. These results suggest potential therapeutic modulation of STING to suppress type 2 inflammation and/or increase anti-viral responses during respiratory infections.","Cavagnero, Kellen J.; Badrani, Jana H.; Naji, Luay H.; Amadeo, Michael B.; Leng, Anthea S.; Lacasa, Lee Diego; Strohm, Allyssa N.; Renusch, Samantha R.; Gasparian, Suzanna S.; Doherty, Taylor A.",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.618807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33679760/,447

OBJECTIVE: To identify whether corticosteroids were beneficial to COVID-19 patients. METHODS: 1514 severe and 249 critical hospitalized COVID-19 patients from two medical centers in Wuhan, China. Multivariable Cox models, Cox model with time-varying exposure and propensity score analysis (inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighting (IPTW) and propensity score matching (PSM)) were used to estimate the association of corticosteroid use with risk of in-hospital mortality in severe and critical cases. RESULTS: Corticosteroids were administered in 531 (35.1%) severe and 159 (63.9%) critical patients. Compared to non-corticosteroid group, systemic corticosteroid use was not associated with beneficial effect in reducing in-hospital mortality in both severe cases (HR=1.77, 95% CI: 1.08-2.89, p=0.023), and critical cases (HR=2.07, 95% CI: 1.08-3.98, p=0.028). Findings were similar in time-varying Cox analysis. For severe COVID-19 patients at admission, corticosteroid use was not associated with improved or harmful outcome in either PSM or IPTW analysis. For critical COVID-19 patients at admission, results were consistent with multivariable Cox model analysis. CONCLUSION: Corticosteroid use was not associated with beneficial effect in reducing in-hospital mortality for severe or critical cases in Wuhan.

A meta-analysis was not deemed appropriate because of the heterogeneity of populations, interventions, and outcomes. Thus, a narrative synthesis is presented instead. This review demonstrates that educating patients for anticoagulation management through their smartphones or tablets improves their knowledge levels, medication or treatment adherence, satisfaction, and clinical outcomes. Moreover, it has a positive effect on continuing health care.

As an additional effort, this study regresses a ratio of accumulative confirmed infection cases at the city level in China on both inter-city and intra-city BE attributes. A mixed geographically weighted regression model was estimated to accommodate both local and global effects of BE attributes. It is found that spatial clusters are mostly related to low infections in 28.63 % of the cities. The density of point of interests around railway stations, travel time by public transport to activity centers, and the number of flights from Hubei Province are associated with the spread. On average, the most influential BE attribute is the number of trains from Hubei Province. Higher infection ratios are associated with higher values of between-ness centrality in 70.98 % of the cities. In 79.22 % of the cities, the percentage of the aging population shows a negative association.

OBSERVATIONS: A 63-year-old male was admitted in intensive care unit (ICU), seven days after the beginning of an influenza-like symptoms, to manage an acute respiratory syndrome related with SARS-CoV-2. Chest scan showed interstitial pneumonia with “crazy paving” patterns. At day 19, ocular examination at the patient's bed described petechias and tarsal hemorrhages, mucous filaments and tarsal pseudomembranous. Conjunctival scrapings and swabs did not identify any bacteria or virus. To our knowledge, we described the first case of pseudomembranous conjunctivitis in a COVID-19 patient. CONCLUSION AND IMPORTANCE: Considering that SARS-CoV-2 is present in tears and conjunctival secretions, external ocular infections could be factors of infectious spreading. Physicians should be aware of late (>2 weeks) ocular complications in COVID-19 patients to prevent sequelae.","Navel, Valentin; Chiambaretta, Frédéric; Dutheil, Frédéric",Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajoc.2020.100735; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451993620300876?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2451993620300876; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32377594/,447

Because presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been reported in the human reproductive system, we assessed whether pre-implantation embryos are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 entry. RNA-seq and immunostaining studies revealed presence of two key entry factors in the trophectoderm of blastocyst-stage embryos, the ACE2 receptor and the TMPRSS2 protease. Exposure of blastocysts to fluorescent reporter virions pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein revealed S-ACE2 dependent entry and fusion. These results indicate that human pre-implantation embryos can be infected by SARS-CoV-2, a finding pertinent to natural human conceptions and assisted reproductive technologies during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Montano, Mauricio; Victor, Andrea R.; Griffin, Darren K.; Duong, Tommy; Bolduc, Nathalie; Farmer, Andrew; Garg, Vidur; Hadjantonakis, Anna-Katerina; Barnes, Frank L.; Zouves, Christo G.; Greene, Warner C.; Viotti, Manuel",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.21.427501,447

Local and national health care systems, hospitals and health care workers have been overwhelmed by the needs of patients and limited by weaknesses in resources, staff capacity and distribution networks. These circumstances impact the ergonomic conditions within which health care staff work, and subsequently their behavioural responses. In this commentary we argue that urgent research is needed globally to bridge the evidence gap that exists on how best to support health care workers with the repercussions of working on the frontline of a pandemic. Leadership on the frontline is what matters. It is not only what policies, guidelines and checklists are in place to support nurses, doctors and health care workers; it is the actions and behaviours of their frontline and local leaders in implementing initiatives that really make the difference. Recognising that the leadership style, organisational culture, and the model of successful implementation are inextricable is the first step to ensure sustainable interventions to support health care workers’ wellbeing will follow.","OBrien, Niki; Flott, Kelsey; Durkin, Mike",Int J Qual Health Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33227137/; https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzaa153,447

Objective To evaluate urological patient satisfaction with teleconsultation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and methods Observational, prospective, cross-sectional, non-interventional study carried out by telephone survey during the period considered as the peak of the pandemic (March-April 2020). A quality survey composed of 11 questions on urological care provided by physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted, selecting a representative sample of patients attended by teleconsultation. Results Two hundred patients were contacted by telephone to answer a survey on the quality of teleconsultation. The distribution of patients surveyed among the specialized consultations was homogeneous with the number of consultations cited in the period;18% of them required assistance from family members. Sixty percent of patients avoided going to a medical center during the pandemic. Of the surveyed patients, 42% had cancelled diagnostic tests, 59% had cancelled medical consultations, 3.5% had cancelled treatments and 1%, had cancelled interventions. Ten percent reported a worsening of urological symptoms during confinement. According to physicians, consultations were effectively delivered in 72% of cases, with teleconsultation being carried out by their usual urologist in 81%. Teleconsultation overall satisfaction level was 9 (IQI 8−10), and 61.5% of respondents consider teleconsultation as a ""health care option"" after the healthcare crisis. Conclusion Teleconsultation has been evaluated with a high level of satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic, offering continuous care to urological patients during the healthcare crisis. The perceived quality offers a field of optional telematic assistance in selected patients, which should be re-evaluated in a period without confinement measures.","Leibar Tamayo, A.; Linares Espinós, E.; Ríos González, E.; Trelles Guzmán, C.; Álvarez-Maestro, M.; de Castro Guerín, C.; Fernández-Pascual, E.; Girón de Francisco, M.; Gómez de Vicente, J.

Convalescent plasma is one of the therapeutic approaches that might be of benefit. Methods: Forty nine early-stage severe and critically-ill COVID-19 patients residing in RCU of three hospitals in Baghdad, Iraq were included, 21 received convalescent plasma while 28 did not receive, namely control group. Recovery or death, length of stay in hospital, and improvement in the clinical course of the disease were monitored clinically along with laboratory monitoring through SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection via PCR, and SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM serological monitoring. Results: Patients received convalescent plasma showed reduced duration of infection in about 4 days, and showed less death rate, 1/21 versus 8/28 in control group. In, addition, all of the patients received convalescent plasma showed high levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM 3 days after plasma transfusion. Plasma from donors with high levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and donors with positive SRAS-CoV-2 IgM showed better therapeutic results than other donors. Conclusions: Convalescent plasma therapy is an effective mode of therapy if donors with high level of SARS-Cov2 antibodies are selected and if recipients were at their early stage of critical illness, being no more than 3 days in RCU.","Rasheed, Anwar M.; Ftak, Dhurgham F.; Hashim, Hashim A.; Maulood, Mohammed F.; Kabah, Khulood K; Almusawi, Yaqoob A.; Abdulamir, Ahmed S.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.24.20121905; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.24.20121905v1?rss=1,447

684021,Problem solving in the time of coronavirus pandemic,2021,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: The intrinsic dynamics of the propagation of a disease changes along an epidemic course, especially for long lasting epidemics such as the COVID-19. Indeed, the natural evolution of the pathogen and countermeasures such as quarantining, lockdown, social distancing and vaccination modify the transmission dynamics of the disease. With a view to match these theoretical changes to potential changes in observed epidemiological data, we designed a hybrid modeling framework where we integrated: (1) two growth curves for daily reported positive cases, differentiating the early epidemic phase and a second phase with a potentially different dynamics; (2) two logistic regression models for daily recoveries and deaths; and (3) a SIQR (Susceptible, Infective, Quarantined, Recovered) mechanistic model to provide an overview of the dynamics of the disease in the target population. This joint modeling approach allows explicit analytical expressions for the different compartments of the SIQR model, circumventing common identifiability issues in such models. The changes in the disease transmission pattern can be subjected to countermeasures so as to assess their effectiveness along time. For illustrative purposes, we applied the approach to COVID-19 data from West Africa. It turned out that the first imported COVID-19 case(s) in West Africa likely entered the region between 28 January and 7 February 2020. Moreover, the first measures implemented by West African authorities impacted the dynamics of the disease one month after the outbreak. ABSTRACT: The widely used logistic model for epidemic case reporting data may be either restrictive or unrealistic in presence of containment measures when implemented after an epidemic outbreak. For flexibility in epidemic case reporting data modeling, we combined an exponential growth curve for the early epidemic phase with a flexible growth curve to account for the potential change in growth pattern after implementation of containment measures. We also fitted logistic regression models to recoveries and deaths from the confirmed positive cases. In addition, the growth curves were integrated into a SIQR (Susceptible, Infective, Quarantined, Recovered) model framework to provide an overview on the modeled epidemic wave. We focused on the estimation of: (1) the delay between the appearance of the first infectious case in the population and the outbreak (“epidemic latency period”); (2) the duration of the exponential growth phase; (3) the basic and the time-varying reproduction numbers; and (4) the peaks (time and size) in confirmed positive cases, active cases and new infections. The application of this approach to COVID-19 data from West Africa allowed discussion on the effectiveness of some containment measures implemented across the region.","Tovissodé, Chénangnon Frédéric; Doumatè, Jonas Têlé; Glèlè Kakaï, Romain",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33922834/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10050365,447

Due to COVID-19 spreads quickly, is highly contagious, and can be fatal in severe cases, and there are no specific medicines, it poses a huge threat to the life and health of nurses and has a large impact on their emotional responses and coping strategies. Methods: This study conducted an online questionnaire survey from February 1 to 9, 2020 to investigate the current state of emotional responses and coping strategies of nurses and college nursing students in Anhui Province. This study used a modified Brief COPE (Carver, 1997) and a emotional responses scale. Results: The results found that women showed more severe anxiety and fear than men. Participants from cities showed more anxiety and fear than participants from rural, but rural participants showed more sadness than urban participants. The closer COVID-19 is to the participants, the stronger the anxiety and anger. Compared with Nursing college students, nurses have stronger emotional responses and are more willing to use Problem-focused coping. People may have a cycle of ""the more fear, the more problem-focused coping"". And people may ""The more angry, the more emotion-focused coping"", ""the more problem-focused coping, the more anxious, the more angry, the more sadness"". Conclusion: COVID-19 is a pressure source with great influence, both for individuals and for the social public groups. Different individuals and groups may experience different levels of psychological crisis, and those nurses at the core of the incident are affected. Hospitals should focus on providing psychological support to nurses and providing timely psychological assistance and training in coping strategies. Improving nurses' ability to regulate emotions and effective coping strategies, providing a strong guarantee for resolutely winning the battle against epidemic prevention and control.","Huang, Long; xu, Fu ming; Liu, Hai rong",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031898,447

Ergebnisse aus einer deutschen Universitätsaugenklinik,2020-10-10,"Objective: Covid-19 pandemic has significantly affected the assisted reproductive technology (ART) practice. Understanding whether SARS-CoV-2 could infect endometrial tissues during ART is crucial for risk mitigation. Materials and Methods: To address this question, we retrospectively examined the gene expression profile of SARS-CoV-2-associated receptors and proteases in endometrial biopsies of a cohort of ART candidates using Affymetrix microarray data. Human endometrial tissue under natural (n=62) and COS cycles (n=42) were analyzed. A focus was particularly made on the renin-angiotensin system relates genes with a prominent role in the virus infection, and gene expression levels of receptors and proteases closely related to SARS-CoV-2 infectionwas also studied. Results: Using our large cohort of endometrial samples, we reported a high prevalence of genes related to the ACE2 pathway, including AGT, AGTR1, ANPEP, CTSA, ENPEP, LNPEP, MME, NLN, THOP1, BSG and CTSL during both phases(early- and mid-secretory phase), and mainly during the mid-secretory phase for ACE2. The highest signal intensities were found for CTSA, LNPEP, MME, NLN, BSG and CTSL. The most representative of dual coexpression of SARS-CoV-2-associated receptor and protease in endometrium was BSG-CSTL and BSG-CTSA. It s also important to note high variation of SARS-CoV-2 receptors inter-patients under natural cycle.Globally, the impact of COS on endometrial gene expression profile of SARS-CoV-2-associated receptors and proteases of non Covid-19 patients is low, suggesting no additional potential risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection during stimulated ART procedure compared with natural cycles. Conclusions: Analyses of gene expression profiles ofSARS-CoV-2 host entry candidates from microarray data suggest that endometrium should be considered as potential target for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
