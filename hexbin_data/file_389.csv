3112,3112,3112,Factors Informing Outcomes for Older Cats and Dogs in Animal Shelters,15.206953,5.951932,2018-03-07,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Historically, older cats and dogs have been particularly at-risk for euthanasia in animal shelters due to their lower perceived appeal for adoption. This study found that the condition at intake had the greatest impact on the outcomes of older cats and dogs. Additionally, the application of specialized veterinary care, such as orthopedic surgery or chronic disease maintenance, is discussed as factors that inform higher rates of live outcomes for these senior companion animals. These findings demonstrate that if shelters integrate practices that address the specific needs of ageing companion animals, the live outcomes for this population can increase. ABSTRACT: With advances in veterinary medicine that can increase the lifespan of cats and dogs and the effectiveness of spay/neuter programs in reducing the juvenile population of pets, animal shelters are experiencing an increasing population of older companion animals in their care. The purpose of this study was to assess the factors that inform the outcomes of these older cats and dogs. The sample consisted of 124 cats and 122 dogs that were over the age of 84 months (seven years) who were taken into a shelter over a one-year period. To assess the impact of condition at intake on the outcome for the senior animals, a multinomial logistic regression was performed. These findings indicate that preventative programming that can address the reasons these older animals are surrendered, as well as advancements in specialized medical or behavioral programs for ageing companion animals, may support an increase in live outcomes for older cats and dogs in shelters. Further study is needed to evaluate how the quality of life of older animals is impacted by remaining in the care of shelters rather than being euthanized.","Hawes, Sloane; Kerrigan, Josephine; Morris, Kevin",Animals (Basel),389,1
3961,3961,3961,Biguanide is a modifiable pharmacophore for recruitment of endogenous Zn(2+) to inhibit cysteinyl cathepsins: review and implications,14.818454,5.7781467,2019-05-01,"ABSTRACT: Excessive activities of cysteinyl cathepsins (CysCts) contribute to the progress of many diseases; however, therapeutic inhibition has been problematic. Zn(2+) is a natural inhibitor of proteases with CysHis dyads or CysHis(Xaa) triads. Biguanide forms bidentate metal complexes through the two imino nitrogens. Here, it is discussed that phenformin (phenylethyl biguanide) is a model for recruitment of endogenous Zn(2+) to inhibit CysHis/CysHis(X) peptidolysis. Phenformin is a Zn(2+)-interactive, anti-proteolytic agent in bioassay of living tissue. Benzoyl-l-arginine amide (BAA) is a classical substrate of papain-like proteases; the amide bond is scissile. In this review, the structures of BAA and the phenformin-Zn(2+) complex were compared in silico. Their chemistry and dimensions are discussed in light of the active sites of papain-like proteases. The phenyl moieties of both structures bind to the “S2” substrate-binding site that is typical of many proteases. When the phenyl moiety of BAA binds to S2, then the scissile amide bond is directed to the position of the thiolate-imidazolium ion pair, and is then hydrolyzed. However, when the phenyl moiety of phenformin binds to S2, then the coordinated Zn(2+) is directed to the identical position; and catalysis is inhibited. Phenformin stabilizes a “Zn(2+) sandwich” between the drug and protease active site. Hundreds of biguanide derivatives have been synthesized at the 1 and 5 nitrogen positions; many more are conceivable. Various substituent moieties can register with various arrays of substrate-binding sites so as to align coordinated Zn(2+) with catalytic partners of diverse proteases. Biguanide is identified here as a modifiable pharmacophore for synthesis of therapeutic CysCt inhibitors with a wide range of potencies and specificities.

Our objective was to determine if lipid profiles of vaginal swabs were different between postnatal gilts suckled by sow or fed milk replacer the first 48 h after birth, with or without a lard-based fat supplement. Gilts (>1.3 kg) were selected at birth across 8 litters and assigned to one of four treatments: 1) suckled by sow (S, n = 8); 2) suckled by sow plus administration of a fat supplement (SF, n = 5); 3) bottle-fed solely milk replacer (B, n = 8); or 4) bottle-fed solely milk replacer plus administration of a fat supplement (BF, n = 7). At 48 h postnatal, vaginal swabs of gilts were taken with a cytology brush, and lipids were extracted for analysis using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-profiling. Lipids extracted from serum collected at 48 h from gilts, milk collected at 24 h from sows, and milk replacer were also analyzed with MRM-profiling. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis found 18 lipids recovered from vaginal swabs that highly distinguished between S and B gilts [area-under-the-curve (AUC) > 0.9], including phosphatidylethanolamine with 34 carbons and four unsaturations in the fatty acyl residues [PE (34:4)]. Twelve lipids from vaginal swabs highly correlated (r > 0.6; p < 0.01) with nutrition source. Lipids with greater abundance in milk replacer drove association. For example, mean intensity of PE (34:4) was 149-fold higher in milk replacer than colostrum. Consequently, PE (34:4) was found to have 1.6- and 2.12-fold higher levels in serum and vaginal swab samples (p < 0.001), respectively, of B gilts as compared to S gilts. Findings support that vaginal swabs can be used to noninvasively study effects of perinatal nutrition on tissue composition.","Harlow, KaLynn; Ferreira, Christina R.; Sobreira, Tiago J.

6606,6606,6606,The use of laparoscopy in abdominal emergencies,15.251863,5.7797136,2003-05-06,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory infection and failure is a commonly encountered problem in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. However, despite the accumulating body of evidence to suggest that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is associated with pneumonia, the exact role played by this virus in this process is still not fully understood. Therefore, to identify patients at risk, we have conducted a case–control study to characterize patients with HSV-1-positive pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2007 and 2009, all patients with suspected viral pneumonia were tested for the presence of herpes viruses using a PCR assay approach with respiratory specimens. To identify possible associations, risk factors, and impact of HSV, HSV-1-positive ICU patients (n = 51) were compared to age-, gender-, and department- and season-matched HSV-negative patients (n = 52). RESULTS: HSV-positive patients differed significantly from the HSV-negative ones only in terms of time of mechanical ventilation (13 vs. 6 days, respectively; p = 0.002). Subgroup analysis in the patients aged >60 years and in those without bacterial detection revealed a similar trend (p = 0.01 and p = 0.004, respectively). Mortality did not differ between the groups or between the HSV-1-positive patients treated with aciclovir and those who were not. A viral load >10E+05 geq/ml was associated with mechanical ventilation (20/21 vs. 17/29; p = 0.004), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; 19/21 vs. 18/29; p = 0.005), sepsis (18/21 vs. 14/29; p = 0.008), detection of a bacterial pathogen in the same specimen (10/21 vs. 4/29; p = 0.01) and longer ICU stay (25 vs. 30 days; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Despite several associations with high viral load, the clinical outcome of HSV-1-positive ICU patients did not differ significantly from the clinical outcome of HSV-negative patients. This finding indicates that HSV-1 viral loads in respiratory specimens are a symptom of a clinically poor condition rather than a cause of it. Longitudinal and therapy studies are therefore needed to distinguish between HSV-1 as a causative pathogen and HSV-1 as a bystander of pneumonia/ARDS.","Scheithauer, S.; Manemann, A.

Only in the last two centuries vaccination has become a viable strategy to prevent such epidemics. In addition to the clinical efficacy of this strategy, the behavior and public attitudes affect the success of vaccines. This paper describes modeling the efficacy of vaccination considering the cost and benefit of vaccination to individual players. The model is based on the public goods game and is presented as a spatial game on a lattice. Using this model, individuals can contribute to the public health by paying the cost of vaccination or choose to be protected by the public who is vaccinated rather than pay the cost and share the risk of vaccination. Thus, in this model individuals can choose to stay susceptible, can become infected, or choose to vaccinate once in each episode. This paper presents the behavioral changes of the population and the cost to the society as a function of the cost of vaccines, cost of being infected, and the “fear factor” created by the public media.",,IEEE Trans Comput Soc Syst,389,1

One group was vaccinated with two doses of feline leukemia virus vaccine according to the manufacturer's recommendations. All 20 cats were challenge exposed oronasally (4 times over a 1‐week period), beginning 3 weeks after immunization, with a virulent subgroup A strain of FeLV (CT600‐FeLV). The severity of the FeLV infection was enhanced by treating the cats with methylprednisolone acetate at the time of the last FeLV exposure. Ten of 10nonvaccinated cats became persistently viremic compared with 0/10 of the vaccinates. ELISA antibodies to whole FeLV were present at high concentrations after immunization in all of the vaccinated cats, and there was no observable anamnestic antibody response after challenge exposure. ELISA antibodies to whole FeLV appeared at low concentrations in the serum of nonvaccinated cats after infection but disappeared as the viremia became permanently established. Virus neutralizing antibodies were detected in 3/10 vaccinates and 0/10 nonvaccinates immediately before FeLV challenge exposure, and in 8/10 vaccinates and 1/10 nonvaccinates 5 weeks later. Although vaccination did not consistently evoke virus neutralizing antibodies, it appeared to immunologically prime cats for a virus‐neutralizing antibody response after infection. Active FeLV infection was detected in bone marrow cells taken 14 weeks after infection from 10/10 nonvaccinates and 0/10 vaccinates. Latent FeLV infection was not detected in bone marrow cells from any of the vaccinated cats 14 weeks after challenge exposure.","Pedersen, Niels C.",J Vet Intern Med,389,1

An important task in antibody and vaccine preparation is to choose an optimal carrier that will ensure a high immune response. Particularly promising in this regard are nanoscale particle carriers. An antigen that is adsorbed or encapsulated by nanoparticles can be used as an adjuvant to optimize the immune response during vaccination. a very popular antigen carrier used for immunization and vaccination is gold nanoparticles, with are being used to make new vaccines against viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections. Areas covered: This review summarizes what is currently known about the use of gold nanoparticles as an antigen carrier and adjuvant to prepare antibodies in vivo and design vaccines against viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections. The basic principles, recent advances, and current problems in the use of gold nanoparticles are discussed. Expert opinion: Gold nanoparticles can be used as adjuvants to increase the effectiveness of vaccines by stimulating antigen-presenting cells and ensuring controlled antigen release. Studying the characteristics of the immune response obtained from the use of gold nanoparticles as a carrier and an adjuvant will permit the particles’ potential for vaccine design to be increased.","Dykman, Lev A.",Expert Rev Vaccines,389,1

Both entities are well known to be associated with severe post-traumatic complications, including pneumonia, a common complication with a significant impact on the further clinical course. However, the relevance of TBI, chest trauma and particularly their combination as risk factors for the development of pneumonia and its impact on outcomes are not fully elucidated. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of poly-traumatized patients treated between 2010 and 2015 at a level I trauma centre was performed. Inclusion criteria were: Injury Severity Score ≥ 16 and age ≥ 18 years. TBI and chest trauma were classified according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale. Complications (i.e. acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and pneumonia) were documented by a review of the medical records. The primary outcome parameter was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Over the clinical course, 19.9% of all patients developed pneumonia, and in-hospital mortality was 25.3%. Pneumonia (OR 5.142, p = 0.001) represented the strongest independent predictor of in-hospital mortality, followed by the combination of chest injury and TBI (OR 3.784, p = 0.008) and TBI (OR 3.028, p = 0.010). Chest injury alone, the combination of chest injury and TBI, and duration of ventilation were independent predictors of pneumonia [resp. OR 4.711 (p = 0.004), OR 4.193 (p = 0.004), OR 1.002 (p < 0.001)]. CONCLUSIONS: Chest trauma alone and especially its combination with TBI represent high-risk injury patterns for the development of pneumonia, which forms the strongest predictor of mortality in poly-traumatized patients.","Hofman, Martijn; Andruszkow, Hagen; Kobbe, Philipp; Poeze, Martijn; Hildebrand, Frank",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,389,1

It can differentiate between rapidly replicating tachyzoites that cause acute infection and slowly growing bradyzoites in tissue cysts. Treatment options for toxoplasmosis are challenging because current therapies cannot eradicate the latent T. gondii infection that is mainly caused by the bradyzoite forms. Accordingly, recurrence of infection is a problem for immunocompromised patients and congenitally infected patients. Protein kinases have been widely studied in eukaryotic cells, and while little is known about signaling in Toxoplasma infection, it is likely that protein kinases play a key role in parasite proliferation, differentiation, and probably invasion. To identify optimized new kinase inhibitors for drug development against T. gondii, we screened a library of kinase inhibitor compounds for anti-Toxoplasma activity and host cell cytotoxicity. Pyrimethamine served as a positive control and 0.5% DMSO was used as a negative control. Among the 80 compounds screened, 6 compounds demonstrated ≥ 80% parasite growth inhibition at concentrations at which 5 compounds did not suppress host cell viability, while 3 kinase inhibitors (Bay 11-7082, Tyrphostin AG 1295 and PD-98059) had suppressive effects individually on parasite growth and host cell invasion, but did not strongly induce bradyzoite formation.

Hydrophilic Plasdone® S630 copovidone (S630), N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone and vinyl acetate copolymer, and methacrylate-based cationic copolymer, Eudragit® EPO (EPO), were used as polymeric carriers to prepare drug/polymer binary mixtures. Commercially available PMOL was crystallised under ultra sound sonication to produce micro/nano-sized (0.2–10 microns) crystals in monoclinic form. Homogeneous binary blends of drug-polymer mixtures at various drug concentrations were obtained via a thorough mixing. The analysis conducted via the single X-ray crystallography determined the detailed structure of the crystallised PMOL in its monoclinic form. The solid state and the morphology analyses of the PMOL in the binary blends evaluated via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), modulated temperature DSC (MTDSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and hot stage microscopy (HSM) revealed the crystalline existence of the drug within the amorphous polymeric matrices. The application of temperature controlled X-ray diffraction (VTXRPD) to study the polymorphism of PMOL showed that the most stable form I (monoclinic) was altered to its less stable form II (orthorhombic) at high temperature (>112°C) in the binary blends regardless of the drug amount. Thus, VTXRD was used as a useful tool to monitor polymorphic transformations of crystalline drug (e.g. PMOL) to assess their thermal stability in terms of pharmaceutical product development and research.","Maniruzzaman, Mohammed; Lam, Matthew; Molina, Carlos; Nokhodchi, Ali",AAPS PharmSciTech,389,1

However, the molecular mechanisms of EMT remain largely unknown. Tuberous sclerosis proteins TSC1 and TSC2 are key integrators of growth factor signaling, and the loss of TSC1 or TSC2 function leads to a spectrum of diseases that underlie abnormalities in cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and migration. In this study, we investigated the effects of TSC1 on high glucose (HG)-induced EMT of human proximal tubular epithelial HK-2 cells in vitro and renal fibrosis in TSC1(−/−) and db/db mice. We found that the exposure of HK-2 cells to HG (30 mM) time-dependently decreased TSC1 expression, increased the phosphorylation of mTORC1, P70S6K, and 4E-BP-1, and promoted cell migration, resulting in EMT. Transfection of the cells with TSC1 mimic significantly ameliorated HG-induced EMT of HK-2 cells. The tubules-specific TSC1 knockout mice (TSC1(−/−)) displayed a significant decline in renal function. TSC1(−/−) mice, similar to db/db mice, showed greatly activated mTORC1 signaling and EMT process in the renal cortex and exacerbated renal fibrosis. Overexpression of TSC1 through LV-TSC1 transfection significantly alleviated the progression of EMT and renal fibrosis in the renal cortex of db/db mice. Taken together, our results suggest that TSC1 plays a key role in mediating HG-induced EMT, and inhibition of TSC1-regulated mTORC1 signaling may be a potential approach to prevent renal fibrosis in DN.","Lu, Qian; Chen, Yi-bing; Yang, Hao; Wang, Wen-wen; Li, Cheng-cheng; Wang, Lei; Wang, Jin; Du, Lei; Yin, Xiao-xing",Acta Pharmacol Sin,389,1

Disrupting the EZH2–EED interaction, which is required for PRC2 enzymatic activity, is a promising strategy for cancer treatment. However, this kind of inhibitors are still limited. The in-cell protein–protein interaction screening was conducted for approximately 1300 compounds by NanoBRET technology. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), protein thermal shift assay (PTSA), and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) were performed to investigate the regulation of PRC2 by AZD9291. The anti-tumor effects of AZD9291 on breast cancer (BC) cells and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells were detected. MicroRNA array assay, luciferase reporter assay, and qRT-PCR were conducted to identify the interaction and regulation among AZD9291, EZH2, and miR-34a. We discovered that, AZD9291, a potent and selective EGFR inhibitor, disrupted the interaction of EZH2–EED, leading to impairment of PRC2 activity and downregulation of EZH2 protein. In addition, AZD9291 declined EZH2 mRNA expression via upregulating the expression of a tumor suppressor, miR-34a. Our results suggest that AZD9291 can serve as a lead compound for further development of antagonist of PRC2 protein–protein interactions and EZH2 mRNA may be a direct target of miR-34a through non-canonical base pairing.","Zhang, Kai-li; Shen, Qian-qian; Fang, Yan-fen; Sun, Yi-ming; Ding, Jian; Chen, Yi",Acta Pharmacol Sin,389,1

In this study we developed a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) model linking to stomach to simultaneously predict vonoprazan pharmacokinetics and its antisecretory effects following administration to rats, dogs, and humans based on in vitro parameters. The vonoprazan disposition in the stomach was illustrated using a limited-membrane model. In vitro metabolic and transport parameters were derived from hepatic microsomes and Caco-2 cells, respectively. We found the most predicted plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters of vonoprazan in rats, dogs and humans were within twofold errors of the observed data. Free vonoprazan concentrations (f(u) × C(2)) in the stomach were simulated and linked to the antisecretory effects of the drug (I) (increases in pH or acid output) using the fomula dI/dt = k × f(u) × C(2) × (I(max) − I) − k(d) × I. The vonoprazan dissociation rate constant k(d) (0.00246 min(−1)) and inhibition index K(I) (35 nM) for H(+)/K(+)-ATPase were obtained from literatures. The vonoprazan-H(+)/K(+)-ATPase binding rate constant k was 0.07028 min(−1)· μM(−1) using ratio of k(d) to K(I). The predicted antisecretory effects were consistent with the observations following intravenous administration to rats (0.7 and 1.0 mg/kg), oral administration to dogs (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg) and oral single dose or multidose to humans (20, 30, and 40 mg). Simulations showed that vonoprazan concentrations in stomach were 1000-fold higher than those in the plasma at 24 h following administration to human. Vonoprazan pharmacokinetics and its antisecretory effects may be predicted from in vitro data using the PBPK-PD model of the stomach.

Consecutive counselees were included from 2008 to 2010. Counselees with an indication for diagnostic DNA-testing for themselves or a breast cancer affected relative were requested to complete online questionnaires before and after counseling and one year after counseling (N = 152–124). Self-reported surveillance was compared to surveillance recommendations. Consultations were videotaped. Counselees’ reactions to the risks and recommendations were coded. Statements about the risk perception and surveillance intentions of breast cancer unaffected counselees were transcribed. Associations with outcomes were explored. Almost all breast cancer unaffected counselees (>90 %) reacted to their risk estimate with an utterance indicating understanding and this reaction was not significantly associated with their post-visit risk perception alignment. Over one-third (38.6 %) overestimated their risk post-counseling. Few counselees (5.8 %) expressed surveillance intentions. One year after counseling, about three-quarters (74.0 %) of the breast cancer unaffected counselees had adhered to the surveillance recommendation. Almost one-quarter (23.3 %) had performed more mammograms/MRI scans than recommended, which was associated with prior mammography uptake (n = 47; X(2) = 5.2; p = .02).

In an emergency setting, it has been used to support first responders by providing telephone or video consultation with specialists at hospitals and through the exchange of prehospital patient information. This technological solution is evolving rapidly, yet there is a concern that it is being implemented without a demonstrated clinical need and effectiveness as well as without a thorough economic evaluation. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to systematically review whether the clinical outcomes achieved, as reported in the literature, favor telemedicine decision support for medical interventions during prehospital care. METHODS: This systematic review included peer-reviewed journal articles. Searches of 7 databases and relevant reviews were conducted. Eligibility criteria consisted of studies that covered telemedicine as data- and information-sharing and two-way teleconsultation platforms, with the objective of supporting medical decisions (eg, diagnosis, treatment, and receiving hospital decision) in a prehospital emergency setting. Simulation studies and studies that included pediatric populations were excluded. The procedures in this review followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. The Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies–of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool was used for the assessment of risk of bias. The results were synthesized based on predefined aspects of medical decisions that are made in a prehospital setting, which include diagnostic decision support, receiving facility decisions, and medical directions for treatment. All data extractions were done by at least two reviewers independently. RESULTS: Out of 42 full-text reviews, 7 were found eligible. Diagnostic support and medical direction and decision for treatments were often reported. A key finding of this review was the high agreement between prehospital diagnoses via telemedicine and final in-hospital diagnoses, as supported by quantitative evidence. However, a majority of the articles described the clinical value of having access to remote experts without robust quantitative data. Most telemedicine solutions were evaluated within a feasibility or short-term preliminary study. In general, the results were positive for telemedicine use; however, biases, due to preintervention confounding factors and a lack of documentation on quality assurance and protocol for telemedicine activation, make it difficult to determine the direct effect on patient outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The information-sharing capacity of telemedicine enables access to remote experts to support medical decision making on scene or in prolonged field care. The influence of human and technology factors on patient care is poorly understood and documented.","Kim, Yesul; Groombridge, Christopher; Romero, Lorena; Clare, Steven; Fitzgerald, Mark Christopher",J Med Internet Res,389,1

However, previous studies and data on economic activity either have a coarse spatial resolution or cover a limited time span, and the high-resolution characteristics of socioeconomic dynamics are largely unknown. Here, we construct a dataset on the economic activity of mainland China, the gridded establishment dataset (GED), which measures the volume of establishments at a 0.01° latitude by 0.01° longitude scale. Specifically, our dataset captures the geographically based opening and closing of approximately 25.5 million firms that registered in mainland China over the period 2005–2015. The characteristics of fine granularity and long-term observability give the GED a high application value. The dataset not only allows us to quantify the spatiotemporal patterns of the establishments, urban vibrancy, and socioeconomic activity, but also helps us uncover the fundamental principles underlying the dynamics of industrial and economic development.","Dong, Lei; Yuan, Xiaohui; Li, Meng; Ratti, Carlo; Liu, Yu",Sci Data,389,16

A model was recently developed to predict incident sustained VA in patients with ARVC. However, since this outcome may overestimate the risk for SCD, we aimed to specifically predict life-threatening VA (LTVA) as a closer surrogate for SCD. METHODS: We assembled a retrospective cohort of definite ARVC cases from 15 centers in North America and Europe. Association of 8 prespecified clinical predictors with LTVA (SCD, aborted SCD, sustained, or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator treated ventricular tachycardia >250 beats per minute) in follow-up was assessed by Cox regression with backward selection. Candidate variables included age, sex, prior sustained VA (≥30s, hemodynamically unstable, or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator treated ventricular tachycardia; or aborted SCD), syncope, 24-hour premature ventricular complexes count, the number of anterior and inferior leads with T-wave inversion, left and right ventricular ejection fraction. The resulting model was internally validated using bootstrapping. RESULTS: A total of 864 patients with definite ARVC (40±16 years; 53% male) were included. Over 5.75 years (interquartile range, 2.77–10.58) of follow-up, 93 (10.8%) patients experienced LTVA including 15 with SCD/aborted SCD (1.7%). Of the 8 prespecified clinical predictors, only 4 (younger age, male sex, premature ventricular complex count, and number of leads with T-wave inversion) were associated with LTVA. Notably, prior sustained VA did not predict subsequent LTVA (P=0.850). A model including only these 4 predictors had an optimism-corrected C-index of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.69–0.80) and calibration slope of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.94–0.98) indicating minimal over-optimism. CONCLUSIONS: LTVA events in patients with ARVC can be predicted by a novel simple prediction model using only 4 clinical predictors. Prior sustained VA and the extent of functional heart disease are not associated with subsequent LTVA events.","Cadrin-Tourigny, Julia; Bosman, Laurens P.; Wang, Weijia; Tadros, Rafik; Bhonsale, Aditya; Bourfiss, Mimount; Lie, Øyvind H.; Saguner, Ardan M.; Svensson, Anneli; Andorin, Antoine; Tichnell, Crystal; Murray, Brittney; Zeppenfeld, Katja; van den Berg, Maarten P.; Asselbergs, Folkert W.; Wilde, Arthur A.M.; Krahn, Andrew D.; Talajic, Mario; Rivard, Lena; Chelko, Stephen; Zimmerman, Stefan L.; Kamel, Ihab R.; Crosson, Jane E.; Judge, Daniel P.; Yap, Sing-Chien; Van der Heijden, Jeroen F.; Tandri, Harikrishna; Jongbloed, Jan D.H.; van Tintelen, J.

The phytochemical screening was carried out using GC-MS, HPLC-ESI-MS-MS, and NMR techniques. Hot extraction of n-hexane was carried out, followed by separation of the part insoluble in methanol: wax (WA-hex), from the part soluble in methanol (ME-hex). GC-MS analysis of the ME-hex part revealed the presence of methylbenzoic acids such as sparassol and atraric acid and a diterpene with a kaurene skeleton which has never been detected before in lichen species. Out of all the compounds identified by HPLC-ESI-MS-MS, sixteen compounds are common between WA-hex and ME-hex. Most are aliphatic fatty acids, phenolic compounds and depsides. The wax part is characterised by the presence of atranorin, a depside of high biological value. Proton 1H and carbon 13C NMR have confirmed its identification. Atranol, chloroatranol (depsides compound), Ffukinanolide (sesquiterpene lactones), leprolomin (diphenyl ether), muronic acid (triterpenes), and ursolic acid (triterpenes) have also been identified in ME-hex.

While in animals, O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) modifies thousands of intracellular proteins, the human pathogen Toxoplasma gondii transfers a different sugar, fucose, to proteins involved in transcription, mRNA processing, and signaling. Knockout experiments showed that TgSPY, an ortholog of plant SPINDLY and paralog of host OGT, is required for nuclear O-fucosylation. Here we verify that TgSPY is the nucleocytoplasmic O-fucosyltransferase (OFT) by 1) complementation with TgSPY-MYC(3), 2) its functional dependence on amino acids critical for OGT activity, and 3) its ability to O-fucosylate itself and a model substrate and to specifically hydrolyze GDP-Fuc. While many of the endogenous proteins modified by O-Fuc are important for tachyzoite fitness, O-fucosylation by TgSPY is not essential. Growth of Δspy tachyzoites in fibroblasts is modestly affected, despite marked reductions in the levels of ectopically expressed proteins normally modified with O-fucose. Intact TgSPY-MYC(3) localizes to the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas catalytic mutants often displayed reduced abundance. Δspy tachyzoites of a luciferase-expressing type II strain exhibited infection kinetics in mice similar to wild-type but increased persistence in the chronic brain phase, potentially due to an imbalance of regulatory protein levels. The modest changes in parasite fitness in vitro and in mice, despite profound effects on reporter protein accumulation, and the characteristic punctate localization of O-fucosylated proteins suggest that TgSPY controls the levels of proteins to be held in reserve for response to novel stresses.","Bandini, Giulia; Agop-Nersesian, Carolina; van der Wel, Hanke; Mandalasi, Msano; Kim, Hyun W.; West, Christopher M.; Samuelson, John",J Biol Chem,389,1

We computed the ratios using the Bertalanffy-Pütter model, because this model was more flexible with respect to the ratios than the traditional models. For them, there were a-priori restrictions on the possible range of the ratios. (Further, as the Bertalanffy-Pütter model generalizes the traditional models, its fit to the data was necessarily better.) For six birds there was no inflection point (we set the ratio to 0), for 19 birds the ratio was between 0 and 0.368 (lowest ratio attainable for the Richards model), for 48 birds it was above 0.5 (fixed ratio of logistic growth), and for the remaining eight birds it was in between; the maximal observed ratio was 0.835. With these ratios we were able to detect small variations in avian growth due to slight differences in the environment: Our results indicate that blue tits grew more slowly (had a lower ratio) in the presence of light pollution and modified impervious substrate, a finding that would not have been possible had we used traditional growth curve analysis.","Brunner, Norbert; Kühleitner, Manfred; Renner-Martin, Katharina",PLoS One,389,1

It is now recognised that changes may be needed to diabetes management in some older people. Whilst there is clear guidance on the evaluation of frailty and subsequent target setting for people living with frailty, there remains a lack of formal guidance for healthcare professionals in how to achieve these targets. The management of older adults with type 2 diabetes is complicated by comorbidities, shortened life expectancy and exaggerated consequences of adverse effects from treatment. In particular, older adults are more prone to hypoglycaemia and are more vulnerable to its consequences, including falls, fractures, hospitalisation, cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Thus, assessment of frailty should be a routine component of a diabetes review for all older adults, and glycaemic targets and therapeutic choices should be modified accordingly. Evidence suggests that over-treatment of older adults with type 2 diabetes is common, with many having had their regimens intensified over preceding years when they were in better health, or during more recent acute hospital admissions when their blood glucose levels might have been atypically high, and nutritional intake may vary. In addition, assistance in taking medications, as often occurs in later life following implementation of community care strategies or admittance to a care home, may dramatically improve treatment adherence, leading to a fall in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. As a person with diabetes gets older, simplification, switching or de-escalation of the therapeutic regimen may be necessary, depending on their level of frailty and HbA1c levels. Consideration should be given, in particular, to de-escalation of therapies that may induce hypoglycaemia, such as sulphonylureas and shorter-acting insulins. We discuss the use of available glucose-lowering therapies in older adults and recommend simple glycaemic management algorithms according to their level of frailty.","Strain, W.

A wide spectrum of comorbidities, including other neurodegenerative diseases, are frequently associated with AD. How AD interacts with those comorbidities can be examined by analysing gene expression patterns in affected tissues using bioinformatics tools. We surveyed public data repositories for available gene expression data on tissue from AD subjects and from people affected by neurodegenerative diseases that are often found as comorbidities with AD. We then utilized large set of gene expression data, cell-related data and other public resources through an analytical process to identify functional disease links. This process incorporated gene set enrichment analysis and utilized semantic similarity to give proximity measures. We identified genes with abnormal expressions that were common to AD and its comorbidities, as well as shared gene ontology terms and molecular pathways. Our methodological pipeline was implemented in the R platform as an open-source package and available at the following link: https://github.com/unchowdhury/AD_comorbidity. The pipeline was thus able to identify factors and pathways that may constitute functional links between AD and these common comorbidities by which they affect each others development and progression.

Overwhelming evidence indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction is a central factor in PD pathophysiology, which impairs energy metabolism. While, several other studies have shown probiotic supplementations to improve host energy metabolism, alleviate the disease progression, prevent gut microbiota dysbiosis and alter commensal bacterial metabolites. But, whether probiotic and/or prebiotic supplementation can affect energy metabolism and cause the impediment of PD progression remains poorly characterized. Therefore, we investigated 8-weeks supplementation effects of probiotic [Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius AP-32 (AP-32)], residual medium (RM) obtained from the AP-32 culture medium, and combination of AP-32 and RM (A-RM) on unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD rats. We found that AP-32, RM and A-RM supplementation induced neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons along with improved motor functions in PD rats. These effects were accompanied by significant increases in mitochondrial activities in the brain and muscle, antioxidative enzymes level in serum, and altered SCFAs profile in fecal samples. Importantly, the AP-32 supplement restored muscle mass along with improved motor function in PD rats, and produced the best results among the supplements. Our results demonstrate that probiotic AP-32 and A-RM supplementations can recover energy metabolism via increasing SCFAs producing and mitochondria function. This restoring of mitochondrial function in the brain and muscles with improved energy metabolism might additionally be potentiated by ROS suppression by the elevated generation of antioxidants, and which finally leads to facilitated recovery of 6-OHDA-induced motor deficit. Taken together, this work demonstrates that probiotic AP-32 supplementation could be a potential candidate for alternate treatment strategy to avert PD progression.","Nurrahma, Bira Arumndari; Tsao, Shu-Ping; Wu, Chieh-Hsi; Yeh, Tu-Hsueh; Hsieh, Pei-Shan; Panunggal, Binar; Huang, Hui-Yu",Front Aging Neurosci,389,1

An effective treatment strategy is still lacking. The aim of this study was to describe and evaluate the safety and immersiveness of a newly designed ICU-specific virtual reality module. DESIGN: A randomized controlled healthy volunteer trial. SETTING: ICU of the Franciscus Gasthuis & Vlietland Hospital (Rotterdam, the Netherlands), a large teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five virtual reality–naive healthy volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: Volunteers were randomized to three arms: the head-mounted display virtual reality group (n = 15), the 2D group (n = 15), and the crossover group (n = 15). Safety was assessed by changes in vital signs and the occurrence of simulator sickness (Simulator Sickness Questionnaire). Immersiveness was assessed using the Igroup Presence Questionnaire. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Volunteers in the head-mounted display virtual reality group experienced more mild symptoms of simulator sickness, expressed as symptoms of dizziness (p = 0.04) and stomach awareness (p = 0.04), than the 2D group. Nevertheless, none of the individual Simulator Sickness Questionnaire items were scored as being severe, no changes in vital signs were observed, and no sessions were prematurely stopped. Volunteers in the crossover group experienced a higher total presence (p < 0.001) when using head-mounted display virtual reality, expressed as a higher sense of presence (p < 0.001), more involvement (p < 0.01), and more experienced realism (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: ICU-specific virtual reality appears safe and more immersive than 2D, implicating that ICU-specific virtual reality is feasible for clinical use. One should however be aware of simulator sickness-related symptoms. Future research is needed to confirm these findings in survivors of critical illness.","Vlake, Johan H.; Wils, Evert-Jan; van Bommel, Jasper; Korevaar, Tim I.

Vaccine efforts to date indicate the need to increase the immunogenicity of Schistosoma antigens. The multiple antigen-presenting system, whereby proteins are genetically fused to rhizavidin and affinity linked to biotinylated templates, enables the generation of robust immune responses. The objective of this work was to express and purify the S. mansoni antigens, SmTSP-2 and SmCD59.2, in fusion with rhizavidin. The fusion with rhizavidin greatly decreased the expression level of rSmTSP-2, but not rSmCD59.2, and both were expressed in the insoluble fraction, requiring optimization of culture conditions. Evaluation of different E. coli strains and media showed that BL21-DE3 cultured in Terrific Broth provided the highest expression levels of both proteins. Investigation of a range of time and temperature of induction showed that E. coli strains expressing rRzv:SmTSP-2 and rRzv:SmCD59.2 showed the highest protein production at 23 °C for 15 h. Recombinant proteins were purified by a single step of affinity chromatography allowing isolation of these proteins in high concentration and purity. The optimization process increased final soluble protein yield of rRzv:SmTSP-2 by fourfold and rRzv:SmCD59.2 by tenfold, providing ~ 20 mg/L of each protein.

Chlorination, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and ozone (O(3)) are currently the most common methods for water disinfection; however, the generation of toxic by-products and the non-remnant effect of UV and O(3) still constitute major drawbacks. Photo-assisted electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) on the other hand, appear as a potentially effective option for water disinfection. In these processes, the synergism between electrochemically produced active species and photo-generated radicals, improve their performance when compared with the corresponding separate processes and with other physical or chemical approaches. In photo-assisted EAOPs the inactivation of pathogens takes place by means of mechanisms that occur at different distances from the anode, that is: (i) directly at the electrode’s surface (direct oxidation), (ii) at the anode’s vicinity by means of electrochemically generated hydroxyl radical species (quasi-direct), (iii) or at the bulk solution (away from the electrode surface) by photo-electrogenerated active species (indirect oxidation). This review addresses state of the art reports concerning the inactivation of pathogens in water by means of photo-assisted EAOPs such as photo-electrocatalytic process, photo-assisted electrochemical oxidation, photo-electrocoagulation and cathodic processes. By focusing on the oxidation mechanism, it was found that while quasi-direct oxidation is the preponderant inactivation mechanism, the photo-electrocatalytic process using semiconductor materials is the most studied method as revealed by numerous reports in the literature. Advantages, disadvantages, trends and perspectives for water disinfection in photo-assisted EAOPs are also analyzed in this work.","García-Espinoza, Josué Daniel; Robles, Irma; Durán-Moreno, Alfonso; Godínez, Luis A.",Chemosphere,389,1

Mechanistically, IL-6 triggers the interaction between JAK2 and BECN1, where JAK2 phosphorylates BECN1 at Y333. We demonstrate that BECN1 Y333 phosphorylation is crucial for BECN1 activation and IL-6-induced autophagy by regulating PI3KC3 complex formation. Furthermore, we investigate BECN1 Y333 phosphorylation as a predictive marker for poor CRC prognosis and chemotherapy resistance.

In addition, viable PRRSV and SVA were detected by bioassay pigs inoculated with samples of vitamin A, and infectious SVA was detected in pigs inoculated with samples of lysine and choline. These results provide further evidence that select viral pathogens of pigs can survive in certain feed ingredients during commercial transit.","Dee, Scott; Shah, Apoorva; Cochrane, Roger; Clement, Travis; Singrey, Aaron; Edler, Roy; Spronk, Gordon; Niederwerder, Megan; Nelson, Eric",Transbound Emerg Dis,389,1

In a district general hospital, a web-based system generated an email referral, which lacked visibility and tracking/audit of the process, with no record generated automatically in paper inpatient notes or electronic patient records (EPR). We aimed to improve the visibility and safety of the interspecialty referral system. We canvassed stakeholders, informally and via an online satisfaction survey, collecting qualitative and quantitative data about attitudes to the existing system, generating ideas for change. We process mapped the system, identifying points of weakness. We adapted our EPR system, using a work-around solution, to develop a form that could be emailed from the EPR. This generated a permanent record within the EPR and an electronic record of the referral having been sent. We measured the visibility of referrals and responses within the EPR. We generated an online training ‘how-to’ video and reaudited stakeholder satisfaction. There was a significant increase in the proportion of junior doctors satisfied or very satisfied with the interspecialty referral system (27/31 postintervention; 87.1% vs 26/55 preintervention; 47%; p<0.0001) and more believed that the visibility was adequate or very adequate (24/31 postintervention; 77.4% vs 9/55 preintervention; 16.4%; p<0.0001). Visibility of referrals by project team members on the EPR increased from a baseline of 3.5% to 83.6% and the visibility of responses to these referrals on the EPR increased from 4.6% to 40.7%. Qualitative feedback was excellent, hospital executive approval was gained and our work-around system spread to non-team members. We developed a more visible and reliable interspecialty referral system, adapting existing EPR capabilities, which was popular with users and led to cultural change in interspecialty referral responders. A formal EPR redesign, informed by our project, is in development.","Kwon, Dowan; Moon, Won Young; Akhunbay-Fudge, Michelle; Pieters, Brandon; Pillai, Jeni; Wilson, Charlie; Morrison, Jo",BMJ Open Qual,389,17

The objective of this midterm review analysis was to identify the gaps and opportunities for cervical cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care to inform the next cervical cancer strategy in Zimbabwe. METHODS: A mixed methods approach was used for the midterm review. Secondary data was collected from programme documents, published and grey literature. Primary data was collected in six provinces through key informant interviews with officials and focus group discussions with beneficiaries. After data analysis, a draft report was presented to a technical working group to validate the findings and to fill in any gaps. RESULTS: This midterm review revealed a myriad of gaps of the strategy particularly in diagnosis, treatment and care of cervical cancer and the primary focus was on secondary prevention. There was no data to quantify the level of awareness and advocacy for cervical cancer prevention. Our results revealed that there was no data on the proportion of women who ever tested for cervical cancer which existed nationally. Our findings suggest that some health facilities were screening women above 50 years old using VIAC, which is an inappropriate approach for those women. Quality control of VIAC and treatment of precancers were not part of the strategy. Pathological services were not efficient and effective due to lack of resources and additionally data on investigations were not routinely collected and available at the national level. Other gaps identified were limited funding, human resources, equipment, and commodities as well as lack of leadership at the national level to coordinate the various components of the cervical cancer programme. There are also numerous opportunities identified to build upon some successes realized to date. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings emphasized the importance of effective and holistic planning in cervical cancer screening programmes in low-resource settings. In addition, huge investments are required in cervical cancer programmes and governments need to take centre role in mobilizing the requisite resources.","Tapera, Oscar; Nyakabau, Anna M.; Simango, Ndabaningi; Guzha, Bothwell T.; Jombo-Nyakuwa, Shamiso; Takawira, Eunice; Mapanga, Angeline; Makosa, Davidzoyashe; Madzima, Bernard",BMC Public Health,389,1

However, there is scarcity of literature to observe the scenario. This cross-sectional study with mix-method approach conducted a comparative analysis with a focus on compliance with WASH facilities between two categories of CCs in Meherpur and Kustia District in Bangladesh. There were total 420 respondents out of which 400 were selected purposively from the 20 renovated and non-renovated CCs for quantitative approach and 20 respondents for qualitative approach. Data were collected using face-to-face interview method. The study revealed that all of the renovated CCs had safe drinking water source, functioning toilet, hand washing and dust bin facilities except for a few cases with technical problem in water supply. But the reverse scenario was observed in non-renovated CCs. Compliance on WASH facilities in renovated CCs was two times higher than the non-renovated CCs. Clients aged ≤40 years (AOR = 0.41, renovated CCs), and married (AOR = 4.03, non-renovated CCs) did not comply the use of safe drinking water in CCs. Noncompliance of toilet use (AOR = 12.15, renovated CCs and AOR = 8.96, non-renovated CCs) and hand washing facility use (AOR = 8.46, renovated CCs and AOR = 16.8, non-renovated CCs) significantly found higher among respondents who had no formal education. Non-renovated CCs need to develop their WASH facilities as well as ensure maintenance whereas the renovated CCs need dedicated human resource as well as effective policies to maintain the sustainability.","Akter, Nasrin; Banu, Bilkis; Hossain, Sarder Mahmud; Shakib, Shaminul Hoque; Awal, A.S.Nurullah",Heliyon,389,1

However, some E. coli strains of different pathotypes can cause disease in both humans and animals. Atypical enteropathogenic E. coli (aEPEC) can infect both animals and humans or influence the severity of other ongoing infections. RESULTS: In the present study, a total of 332 samples were collected from ducks, geese, turkeys, chickens, and pigeons from the Hungarian Veterinary Diagnostic Directorate, two slaughterhouses, two pigeon keepers and one backyard chicken farm. E. coli was isolated and verified from 319 samples. The isolates were screened by PCR for diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes. Altogether seven atypical enteropathogenic E. coli (aEPEC) strains were identified: two from four-week-old dead turkeys, two from force-fed geese, and three from pigeons. No further pathotypes were identified in the collection. The atypical EPEC strains were classified phylogenetically to B1, B2, and F, and four out of the seven aEPEC isolates proved to be multidrug resistant. Serotypes of aEPEC strains were uniform collected from same farms and showed diversity between their origins with O76, O145, O109 serogroups. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report in the literature about aEPEC in goose (Anser anser domestica). Furthermore, this is the first isolation of aEPEC from turkeys and pigeons in Hungary. The uneven distribution of aEPEC in different age groups of poultry suggests that aEPEC disappears with growing up, but stress (e.g.: force-feeding) and concurrent diseases might promote its reappearance in the intestine.","Adorján, András; Thuma, Ákos; Könyves, László; Tóth, István",BMC Vet Res,389,22

In seismically active regions of Southwest China, local rural residents' dilapidated housing with poor seismic performance aggravates the impacts of earthquakes on their mental health. These residents' mental health is difficult to recognize because of the lack of appropriate assessment methods. In addition, rural residents in the area have a low socioeconomic status and cannot access adequate mental treatment. Thus, telemedicine could be an effective approach to assist mental health practice in such areas. However, the lack of telemedicine assessment factors in these areas makes it difficult to complete the correct triage and prioritization of rural residents' mental health quickly and effectively. To provide a foundation for applying telemedicine to assess the risk of mental health problems that rural residents in seismically active regions experience, this paper studied whether the degree of safety of housing can affect mental health. In this study, nine villages near the epicenter of the 2019 6.0-magnitude earthquake in Changning County, China were randomly selected, and 162 valid questionnaires were completed. SPSS statistical software was used to analyze the collected data. First, the satisfaction of rural residents with the degree of safety of housing significantly affected the K6 score and whether they suffered from mental problems. Second, the mental health of rural residents living in reinforced concrete frame structure housing was obviously superior to that of those living in other types of housing. Next, the most significant factor affecting mental health was the degree of wall cracks. Finally, a new approach was developed to assess and prioritize the mental health of rural residents by using degrees of housing safety and smart technology in seismically active regions. The telemedicine assessment approach is expected to be used in the future for mental health evaluation and the large-scale data scoring of rural residents.","Pan, Yin; Xie, Ruihang; Yan, Qin; Zhou, Tiejun",Front Public Health,389,1

Disordered apoptosis can cause a variety of diseases; therefore, sensing apoptosis can provide help in study of mechanism of the relevant diseases and drug development. It is known that caspase-3 is a key enzyme involved in apoptosis and the expression of its activity is an indication of apoptosis. Here, we present a genetically encoded switch-on mNeonGreen2-based molecular biosensor. mNeonGreen2 is the brightest monomeric green fluorescent protein. The substrate of caspase-3, DEVD amino acid residues, is inserted in it, while cyclized by insertion of Nostoc punctiforme DnaE intein to abolish the fluorescence (inactive state). Caspase-3-catalyzed cleavage of DEVD linearizes mNeonGreen2 and rebuilds the natural barrel structure to restore the fluorescence (activated state). The characterization exhibited that the Caspase-3 biosensor has shortened response time, higher sensitivity, and prolonged functional shelf life in detection of caspase-3 amongst the existing counterparts. We also used the Caspase-3 biosensor to evaluate the effect of several drugs on the induction of apoptosis of HeLa and MCF-7 tumor cells and inhibition of Zika virus invasion.

We previously introduced a non-invasive FFR calculation (FFR(B)) based on computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) with reduced-order computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and resistance boundary conditions. Current study aimed to assess the feasibility and accuracy of FFR(B) for predicting coronary hemodynamics before and after stenting, with invasive FFR as the reference. Twenty-five patients who had undergone CTCA were prospectively enrolled before invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and FFR-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on 30 coronary vessels. Using reduced-order CFD with novel boundary conditions on three-dimensional (3D) patient-specific anatomic models reconstructed from CTCA, we calculated FFR(B) before and after virtual stenting. The latter simulated PCI by clipping stenotic segments from the 3D coronary models and replacing them with segments to mimic the deployed coronary stents. Pre- and post-virtual stenting FFR(B) were compared with FFR measured pre- and post-PCI by investigators blinded to FFR(B) results. Among 30 coronary lesions, pre-stenting FFR(B) (mean 0.69 ± 0.12) and FFR (mean 0.67 ± 0.13) exhibited good correlation (r = 0.86, p < 0.001) and agreement [mean difference 0.024, 95% limits of agreement (LoA): −0.11, 0.15]. Similarly, post-stenting FFR(B) (mean 0.84 ± 0.10) and FFR (mean 0.86 ± 0.08) exhibited fair correlation (r = 0.50, p < 0.001) and good agreement (mean difference 0.024, 95% LoA: −0.20, 0.16). The accuracy of FFR(B) for identifying post-stenting ischemic lesions (FFR ≤ 0.8) (residual ischemia) was 87% (sensitivity 80%, specificity 88%). Our novel FFR(B), based on CTCA with reduced-order CFD and resistance boundary conditions, accurately predicts the hemodynamic effects of stenting which may serve as a tool in PCI planning.","Chandola, Gaurav; Zhang, Jun-Mei; Tan, Ru-San; Chai, Ping; Teo, Lynette; Allen, John C.; Low, Ris; Huang, Weimin; Leng, Shuang; Fam, Jiang Ming; Chin, Chee Yang; Kassab, Ghassan S.; Low, Adrian Fatt Hoe; Tan, Swee Yaw; Chua, Terrance; Lim, Soo Teik; Zhong, Liang",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,389,1

The aim of the current study was to formulate an excellent model specially for predicting prognosis in these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2012 and December 2015, 749 early-stage BC patients who received NAC in Xijing hospital were included. Patients were randomly assigned to a training cohort (n = 563) and an independent cohort (n = 186). A prognostic model was created and subsequently validated. Predictive performance and discrimination were further measured and compared with other models. RESULTS: Clinical American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, grade, estrogen receptor expression, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status and treatment, Ki-67 expression, lymphovascular invasion, and residual cancer burden were identified as independent prognostic variables for BC treated with NAC. The C-index of the model consistently outperformed other available models as well as single independent factors with 0.78, 0.80, 0.75, 0.82, and 0.77 in the training cohort, independent cohort, luminal BC, HER2-positive BC, and triple-negative BC, respectively. With the optimal cut-off values (280 and 360) selected by X-tile, patients were categorized as low-risk (total points ≤280), moderate-risk (280 < total points ≤ 360), and high-risk (total points >360) groups presenting significantly different 5-year DFS of 89.9%, 56.9%, and 27.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with BC, the first model including residual cancer burden index was demonstrated to predict the survival of individuals with favorable performance and discrimination. Furthermore, the risk stratification generated by it could determine the risk level of recurrence in whole early-stage BC cohort and subtype-specific cohorts, help tailor personalized intensive treatment, and select comparable study cohort in clinical trials.","Hou, N.; Wu, J.; Xiao, J.; Wang, Z.; Song, Z.; Ke, Z.; Wang, R.; Wei, M.; Xu, M.; Wei, J.; Qian, X.; Xu, X.; Yi, J.; Wang, T.; Zhang, J.; Li, N.; Fan, J.; Hou, G.; Wang, Y.; Wang, Z.; Ling, R.",ESMO Open,389,1

Here we show that transient peri-transplant treatment with the central complement component C3 inhibitor Cp40 significantly prolongs median allograft survival in a sensitized nonhuman primate model. Despite donor-specific antibody levels remaining high, fifty percent of Cp40-treated primates maintain normal kidney function beyond the last day of treatment. Interestingly, presence of antibodies of the IgM class associates with reduced median graft survival (8 vs. 40 days; p = 0.02). Cp40 does not alter lymphocyte depletion by rhesus-specific anti-thymocyte globulin, but inhibits lymphocyte activation and proliferation, resulting in reduced antibody-mediated injury and complement deposition. In summary, Cp40 prevents acute antibody-mediated rejection and prolongs graft survival in primates, and inhibits T and B cell activation and proliferation, suggesting an immunomodulatory effect beyond its direct impact on antibody-mediated injury.","Schmitz, Robin; Fitch, Zachary W.; Schroder, Paul M.; Choi, Ashley Y.; Manook, Miriam; Yoon, Janghoon; Song, Mingqing; Yi, John S.; Khandelwal, Sanjay; Arepally, Gowthami M.; Farris, Alton B.; Reis, Edimara S.; Lambris, John D.; Kwun, Jean; Knechtle, Stuart J.",Nat Commun,389,1

This was an observational study in which calf facilities were evaluated on a single visit during June 2015. Housing included hutches (n = 9), individual pens in a barn (n = 11), and group pens in a barn (n = 9). Facility and calf pen evaluations included wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, heat stress index, bedding type, bedding composite sample for bacteria counts, nesting score of calf pens, calf health scoring, and airborne bacteria. Data were analyzed using SAS 9.3 to determine the impact of housing type, environmental, and air quality variables on calf respiratory score. A total of 29 facilities and 437 preweaned calves were evaluated. Calf facility temperature averaged 24.2°C (range 15.5 to 30.6°C) with a relative humidity of 21.5% (range 10 to 78%) and a heat index of 21.5°C (range 6 to 30.9°C). Temperature and airborne bacterial counts were greater in hutches as compared with individual and group pens (P < 0.01). Humidity was similar for hutches and group pens, but greater than individual pens. Gram negative airborne bacterial counts were lowest in individual pens. No difference in heat index was observed across housing type. Mean calf respiratory scores was 2.5 (range of 0 to 9) on a 12 point scale; 13.33% of calves evaluated scored greater than 5, indicating a respiratory challenge. Prevalence of respiratory illness in preweaned calves ranged from 0 to 50% of calves on a per farm basis (mean = 11.05% of calves/farm), with 44.82% of farms having no respiratory illness and 10.32% of farms having 30 to 50% of evaluated calves exhibiting signs of respiratory illness. There was a negative correlation between respiratory score and pen temperature (R(2) = 0.90). There was no influence on respiratory score by housing system, bedding type, ventilation system, relative humidity, airflow, or airborne bacterial counts. Data collected from this study suggests that respiratory illness continues to be a challenge, even when weather is temperate. Additional research is needed to evaluate rates of respiratory illness during cold stress and transitional weather, as well as to evaluate management factors that increase the risk of infection.","Morrill, K.

In this paper, we propose a new and comprehensive framework which uses a hierarchical self-attention model to analyze document readability. In this model, measurements of sentence-level difficulty are captured along with the semantic meanings of each sentence. Additionally, the sentence-level features are incorporated to characterize the overall readability of an article with consideration of article structures. We evaluate our proposed approach on three widely-used benchmark datasets against several strong baseline approaches. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on estimating the readability for various web articles and literature.","Meng, Changping; Chen, Muhao; Mao, Jie; Neville, Jennifer",Advances in Information Retrieval,389,1

We examined cytokine production and phenotypic change after in vitro stimulation of T cells from healthy volunteers using different probiotic strains. Methods: T cells were cultured from colonic biopsies from eight healthy volunteers (Agnholt and Kaltoft, Exp Clin Immunogenet 2001;18:213–25), and dendritic cells were matured from their peripheral blood mononuclear cells. T‐cell cultures were stimulated with autologous bacterial sonicate or strains of Lactobacillus spp., with and without the addition of dendritic cells. Cytokine levels (TNF‐α, IFN‐γ, IL‐10 and GM‐CSF) and phenotype (CD3, CD4, CD25 and CD69) were measured on day 4. Results: Lactobacillus spp. induced higher productions of TNF‐α and IL‐10 than did autologous bacteria. In presence of dendritic cells, the production of all cytokines increased. However, the increases of IFN‐γ and TNF‐α were more pronounced in wells with autologous bacteria than in wells with Lactobacillus spp. The addition of dendritic cells upregulated CD25 expression without simultaneous upregulation of CD69. The upregulation was pronounced after stimulation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG compared with autologous bacteria and other lactobacilli. Discussion: In presence of dendritic cells, autologous bacteria induced inflammatory cytokines, while probiotics mainly induced regulatory cytokines. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG induced a regulatory phenotype (cd25(+)), in part mediated by dendritic cells. Future studies will address whether this shift to a CD25(+) phenotype represents a differentiation into competent regulatory T cells. In a clinical context, such cells might be used for treatment of inflammatory diseases.","Hvas, C. L.; Kelsen, J.; Agnholt, J.; Höllsberg, P.; Dahlerup, J. F.",Scand J Immunol,389,1

In our earlier work, it is shown that human monoclonal antibody isolated from sera of a patient with Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia possess innate antibody characteristics and binds to lactic acid bacteria. According to the immune network model, immunization with this bacteria could induce the perturbations in immune system that might result in production of anti‐Lactobacillus antibodies, human monoclonal antibody like (Ab1) and anti‐idiotypic antibody (Ab2). In this study, BALB/c mice were immunized with two doses of bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus in complete and incomplete Freund's adjuvant and phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS), respectively. Seven days after the last immunization, sera from immunized mice were collected and the presence of Lactobacillus‐specific Ab1 and Ab2 were determined by ELISAs. In the sera of immunized mice, antibodies specific to bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus were shown. The concentration of Lactobacillus‐specific antibodies was higher in the sera of hyperimmunized mice (mice immunized with 1 mg of IgM DJ) than in sera of mice immunized with 100 times lower doses of immunogen (0.01 mg per doses). Moreover, Ab1 and Ab2 antibodies were detected in the sera of Lactobacillus‐hyperimmunized mice. In this study, we have shown the idiotypic network interactions in mice immunized with bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus.","Zivancevic‐Simonovic, S.; Inic‐Kanada, A.; Petricevic, M.; Mijatovic, L.

In this paper, we study the portfolio optimization problem in the Vietnamese stock market by using deep-learning methodologies and one dataset collected from the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange (VN-HOSE) from the beginning of the year 2013 to the middle of the year 2019. We aim to construct an efficient algorithm that can find the portfolio having the highest Sharpe ratio in the next coming weeks. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel loss function and transform the original problem into a supervised problem. The input data can be determined as a 3D tensor, while the predicted output is the unnormalized weighted proportion for each ticker in the portfolio to maximize the daily return Y of the stock market after a given number of days. We compare different deep learning models, including Residual Networks (ResNet), Long short-term memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Self-Attention (SA), Additive Attention (AA), and various combinations: SA + LSTM, SA + GRU, AA + LSTM, and AA + GRU. The experimental results show that the AA + GRU outperforms the rest of the methods on the Sharpe ratio and provides promising results for the portfolio optimization problem not only in Vietnam but also in other countries.

In general, there are two types of contacts: close ones among friends, colleagues and family members, etc., and ordinary contacts from encounters with strangers. Typically, social reinforcement occurs for close contacts. Taking into account both types of contacts, we develop a contact-based model for social contagion. We find that, associated with the spreading dynamics, for random networks there is coexistence of continuous and discontinuous phase transitions, but for heterogeneous networks the transition is continuous. We also find that ordinary contacts play a crucial role in promoting large-scale spreading, and the number of close contacts determines not only the nature of the phase transitions but also the value of the outbreak threshold in random networks. For heterogeneous networks from the real world, the abundance of close contacts affects the epidemic threshold, while its role in facilitating the spreading depends on the adoption threshold assigned to it. We uncover two striking phenomena. First, a strong interplay between ordinary and close contacts is necessary for generating prevalent spreading. In fact, only when there are propagation paths of reasonable length which involve both close and ordinary contacts are large-scale outbreaks of social contagions possible. Second, abundant close contacts in heterogeneous networks promote both outbreak and spreading of the contagion through the transmission channels among the hubs, when both values of the threshold and transmission rate among ordinary contacts are small. We develop a theoretical framework to obtain an analytic understanding of the main findings on random networks, with support from extensive numerical computations. Overall, ordinary contacts facilitate spreading over the entire network, while close contacts determine the way by which outbreaks occur, i.e., through a second- or first-order phase transition. These results provide quantitative insights into how certain social behaviors can emerge and become prevalent, which has potential implications not only to social science but also to economics and political science.","Cui, Peng-Bi; Wang, Wei; Cai, Shi-Min; Zhou, Tao; Lai, Ying-Cheng",,389,1

Large datasets of biomedical citations and full texts are harvested for their metadata and used for training and testing. The ontology representation of Medical Subject Headings provides machine-readable labels and specifies the dimensionality of the problem space. These automated approaches are still far from entirely substituting human experts, yet they can be useful as a mechanism for validation and recommendation.

Neurosurgeons provide critical care and their role in this pandemic is necessary and yet evolving. METHODS: Through professional registries and internet resources, we surveyed neurosurgeons from around the world. We looked at the national burden of illness, perception of preparedness, cancellation of clinics, surgeries and cessation of research and educational activities. Chi-square, Fisher's exact tests, and multivariate logistic regression model were used to analyze variables. RESULTS: Our survey was completed on April 3, 2020, and was well-received (661 completed, 60.7% response rate, 96 nations). Neurosurgeons in affluent nations still lacked adequate resources to combat this pandemic primarily due to lack of preparedness and insufficient medical equipment. The challenges to lower-income nations were similar but also included knowledge dissemination and inadequate resources. Hospital preparedness was central to effective healthcare delivery but also influenced the cancellation of surgeries and clinics. The impact on education, conferences and research was also significant. CONCLUSION: Neurosurgical disorders are significant casualties of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reduction of services, lack of preparedness, inadequate education, insufficient supplies and resources are important contributors. Improved preparedness requires careful planning, real-time surveillance and allocation of resources. This is more critical in poorer nations.","El-Ghandour, Nasser M.F; Elsebaie, Eman; Salem, Amany; Alkhamees, Abdullah; Zaazoue, Mohamed; Fouda, Mohammed A; Ahmed, Rasha G.

Mid-March 2020, with exponentially increasing COVID-19 infections, Luxembourg closed schools and businesses, and declared a crisis (état de crise) to implement confinement measures, including orders to not leave the home unless to fulfill essential needs. The psychological consequences of these policy responses to the pandemic on older people, considered a high-risk group, were unknown at the time. The aim of this study was to use the nationally representative CON-VINCE study that assessed mental health at the height of the confinement measures mid-April 2020, to assess the psychological impact of quarantine on older adults. Method. A total of 451 participants aged 60+ years (55.0% male) filled in the CES-D, the GAD-7 and the 3-item loneliness scale that measured depressive symptoms, level of anxiety, and feelings of social isolation. Results. Mean age was 67.7 years (SD 5.5), average number of school years were 13.1 (SD 3.6). The participants were mainly of Luxembourgish nationality (87.8%), and a majority (69.8%) was married. Clinically relevant depression scores were present in 13.1%, generalized anxiety in 1.8%, and self-perceived isolation in 16.9% of participants. Number of depressive symptoms was associated with perceived isolation (p<0.001) and current exercise levels (p=0.02). Discussion. The rate of older adults with clinically relevant impaired mental health was similar to pre-pandemic levels in Luxembourg, suggesting that negative mental health consequences of the confinement measures were largely absent. Possible explanations are that confinement was considered a universal experience, and that the healthcare system remained functional, unlike in other countries at the time.","Pauly, Claire; Schröder, Valerie; Pauly, Laure; Krüger, Rejko; Leist, Anja",Innov Aging,389,1

The purpose of this study was to examine age differences in stress related to the pandemic and social ties, and whether those experiences are linked to well-being. Participants included a total of 645 adults (43% women) ages 18 to 97 (M = 50.8; SD = 17.7) from the May 2020 nationally representative Survey of Consumers. Participants reported the extent to which they felt stress related to the pandemic in the last month as well as social isolation, negative relationship quality, positive relationship quality, and frequent depression, anxiety and rumination in the past week. Results showed that older people reported less COVID-19 related stress, less social isolation, and lower negative relationship quality than younger people. Greater stress, social isolation, and negative relationship quality were associated with poorer well-being and greater social isolation, and negative quality ties exacerbated the effects of stress on well-being. Although many researchers have indicated that older adults may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 related stress and social isolation, this study indicates that young adults may be relatively more vulnerable. Because isolation and negative relationship quality appear to exacerbate the effects of stress, reducing social isolation and negative relations are potential targets for intervention.","Birditt, Kira; Turkelson, Angela; Fingerman, Karen; Polenick, Courtney; Oya, Akari",Innov Aging,389,1

In doing so, the lived experiences of remote learners who were abruptly shifted to a completely online learning space due to the pandemic COVID-19 in the Indian higher education system are documented. Online interviews were conducted with eight undergraduate and four postgraduate students of English and Cultural Studies, enrolled at a Southern Indian university, and their responses were explicated using the Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) approach. The interviews revealed that the phenomenon of ERL is shaped by dissonance informed by the absence of a familiar learning space. Often the patterns of this dissonance were marked by (1) the perception of learning and learning space, (2) the lack of intimacy in learning and learning space, (3) the negotiations made for learning and the space of learning in ERL, and (4) the challenges to cope with the responsibilities of the ERL scenario. Further, the script approach was applied to analyse the data and the analysis revealed an expansion of the existing internal scripts that were based on previous learning experiences of the learners. The study thus establishes the centrality of space in the process of learning and points out how the lack of a familiar learning space is linked to the absence of internal scripts that considerably impact learning. The study concludes by discussing the possibilities of application of script approach to effectively incorporate the aspect of learning space in new pedagogies and learning models as Blended Learning (BL) and Online Learning (OL) become the new normal worldwide.","Chattaraj, Dishari; Vijayaraghavan, Arya Parakkate",J,389,13

Systems of differential equations with the dynamically redefinable right-hand side at special moments (events) are used. The truth conditions for transitions are obtained from computing other equations for additional characteristics of the state of a generation. Threshold states in process modeling are the result of the inclusion of trigger functions. Their values on the right-hand side are specifically different from the neutral value only in narrow ranges of the space of changing characteristics of a hybrid system and depend on the initial conditions. The restricted limits of functions and their domain of values rest on the core of the threshold effects for the simulated biosystem, which are observed under special conditions. The method allows us to implement actual qualitative changes in management scenarios as bifurcations of the appearance (reduction) of equilibrium states or the boundary crisis of a complex attractor consisting of intervals scattered in a limited area. Computational scenarios for different population processes are investigated. The collapse of fish stocks is described in the model by the examples of cod in the North Atlantic and sturgeon in the Caspian Sea. The rapid outbreak of their abundance is modeled according to observations on the pulsation of the population size of pests of relict evergreen forests. The threshold scenario of the outbreak of insects in the scenario ends spontaneously due to the local exhaustion of forest resources with a sharp transition to fluctuations of the pest, which are ordinary for the environment. The methodology of organizing the structure for the population model is summarized to predict a wide range of extreme processes related to rapid changes in controlled biological systems and the spread of unwanted biological invasions.","Perevaryukha, A.

The goal of our paper is to review whether recent scientific evidence supports forest manipulation to decrease vulnerability. To achieve this goal, we first ask if outbreaks of forest insect pests have been more severe in recent decades. Next, we assess the relative importance of climate change and forest management–induced changes in forest composition/structure in driving these changes in severity. RECENT FINDINGS: Forest structure and composition continue to be implicated in pest outbreak severity. Mechanisms, however, remain elusive. Recent research elucidates how forest compositional and structural diversity at neighbourhood, stand, and landscape scales can increase forest resistance to outbreaks. Many recent outbreaks of herbivorous forest insects have been unprecedented in terms of duration and spatial extent. Climate change may be a contributing factor, but forest structure and composition have been clearly identified as contributing to these unprecedented outbreaks. SUMMARY: Current research supports using silviculture to create pest-resistant forest landscapes. However, the precise mechanisms by which silviculture can increase resistance remains uncertain. Further, humans tend to more often create pest-prone forests due to political, economic, and human resistance to change and a short-sighted risk management perspective that focuses on reactive rather than proactive responses to insect outbreak threats. Future research efforts need to focus on social, political, cultural, and educational mechanisms to motivate implementation of proven ecological solutions if pest-resistant forests are to be favoured by management.","Kneeshaw, Daniel D.; Sturtevant, Brian R.; DeGrandpé, Louis; Doblas-Miranda, Enrique; James, Patrick M.

METHODS: Researchers collaborated with community partners and HS families to adapt the core components (caregiver education; child education; family meal) of SS to an online format. Feasibility outcomes (demand: response rate, attendance, retention; acceptability: satisfaction; implementation: fidelity, cost; limited effectiveness: diet, weight status) were measured: pre, post, or throughout programming via count, survey, focus group, or direct measure. Baseline demographic data were also collected. RESULTS: The research-community team came to consensus on: a) utilizing e-methods families were accustomed to in local HS programs and elementary schools (Google Classroom; Zoom; YouTube videos) for the educational components; b) enhancing the educational components with a supplemental program-specific weekly magazine (“SS Digest”); c) creating a weekly meal kit delivery for the family meal component (“SS Chef's Crate”); and d) adding an additional week to programming (8 to 9) to orient families to the new online format. 13 of 40 families enrolled in HS participated in the fall session of SS-GO programming (32.5% response rate) and mean (SD) weekly attendance was 4.0 (0.86). 11 of the 13 families engaged in the research, and 10 of 11 completed pre- and post-test data collection (91% retention). Survey and focus group data revealed high levels of satisfaction for SS-GO. Weekly lessons were delivered as intended 92.8% of the time, and Chef's Crates were received by families 100% of the time. Mean (SD) food cost of programming was $212.33 (66.06) or $16.33 per family. Limited effectiveness data are forthcoming. Baseline mean (SD) caregiver age was 32.5 (9.32) years (n = 11), 100% (n = 11) female, 72.7% (n = 11) Black, mean (SD) BMI 36.3 (9.31), 36.4% (n = 4) low income, and 36.4% (n = 11) had low or very low food insecurity. Mean (SD) child age was 3.45 (0.69) (n = 11), 45.5% (n = 5) were female, and had a mean (SD) BMI z-score 0.63 (0.76) (n = 11). CONCLUSIONS: SS-GO demonstrates feasibility utilizing a community-based participatory approach. Data will guide future iterations of the program—in COVID-19 and after.

This study aims to analyse the efficacy of ivermectin in improving the Covid‐19 outcomes. We systematically searched the PubMed, Europe PMC and ClinicalTrials.gov database using specific keywords related to our aims until 10th May 2021. All published randomized clinical trial studies on Covid‐19 and ivermectin were retrieved. The quality of the study was assessed using Jadad scale assessment tool for clinical trial studies. Statistical analysis was done using Review Manager 5.4 software. A total of 19 studies with 2768 Covid‐19 patients were included in this meta‐analysis. This meta‐analysis showed that ivermectin was associated with reduction in severity of Covid‐19 (RR 0.43 [95% CI 0.23–0.81], p = 0.008), reduction of mortality (RR 0.31 [95% CI 0.15–0.62], p = 0.001), higher negative RT‐PCR test results rate (RR 1.23 [95% CI 1.01–1.51], p = 0.04), shorter time to negative RT‐PCR test results (mean difference [MD] −3.29 [95% CI −5.69, −0.89], p = 0.007), higher symptoms alleviations rate (RR 1.23 [95% CI 1.03−1.46], p = 0.02), shorter time to symptoms alleviations (MD −0.68 [95% CI −1.07, −0.29], p = 0.0007) and shorter time to hospital discharge (MD −2.66 [95% CI −4.49, −0.82], p = 0.004). Our study suggests that ivermectin may offer beneficial effects towards Covid‐19 outcomes. More randomized clinical trial studies are still needed to confirm the results of our study.","Hariyanto, Timotius Ivan; Halim, Devina Adella; Rosalind, Jane; Gunawan, Catherine; Kurniawan, Andree",Rev Med Virol,389,21

METHODS: We purposively selected three global health training programs. We used a six-step curriculum development framework to systematically compare the curriculum process across programs and to identify best practices and factors contributing to the impact of each of these programs. FINDINGS: All three fellowship programs undertook an intentional and in-depth approach to curriculum development. Each identified competencies related to leadership and technical skills. Each defined goals, though the goals differed to align with the desired impact of the program, ranging from improving the impact of HIV programming, supporting stronger global health program implementation, and supporting the next generation of global health leaders. All programs implemented the curriculum through an onboarding phase, a delivery of core content in different formats, and a wrap-up or endline phase. During implementation, each program also utilized networking and mentoring to enhance connections and to support application of learning in work roles. Programs faced overlapping challenges and opportunities including funding, strengthening partnerships, and finding ways to engage and support alumni. CONCLUSIONS: Local ownership of programs is critical, including tailoring curricula to the needs of specific contexts. Strong partnerships and resources are needed to ensure program sustainability and impact. KEY TAKEAWAYS: Global health competencies and curricula should be linked to local health system needs and contexts where learners are working. Emphasizing both individualistic and collectivist approaches to learning is important in engaging and supporting diverse global health learners. Emphasizing mentorship and opportunities to apply learning in contexts where learners are working is important in order to provide support to learners as they work to integrate what they are learning into their professional roles and activities. Partnerships and resources—including donor support—are essential to implement and sustain robust leadership curricula and to provide opportunities for experiential and didactic learning.","Schleiff, Meike J.; Mburugu, Patrick Mwirigi; Cape, John; Mwenesi, Rama; Sirili, Nathanael; Tackett, Sean; Urassa, David P.; Hansoti, Bhakti; Mashalla, Yohana",,389,19

The present study examined whether differential provincial reductions in medical opioid dispensing following restrictive regulations (post-2010) were associated with differential contributions of fentanyl to opioid mortality. Annual provincial opioid dispensing totals in defined daily doses/1000 population/day, and change rates in opioid dispensing for the 10 provinces for (1) 2011–2018 and (2) “peak-year” to 2018 were derived from a pan-Canadian pharmacy-based dispensing panel. Provincial contribution rates of fentanyl to opioid-related mortality (2016–2019) were averaged. Correlation values (Pearson’s R) between provincial changes in opioid dispensing and the relative fentanyl contributions to mortality were computed for the two scenarios. The correlation between province-based changes in opioid dispensing (2011–2018) and the relative contribution of fentanyl to total opioid deaths (2016–2019) was −0.70 (t = 2.75; df = 8; p = 0.03); the corresponding correlation for opioid dispensing changes (“peak-year” to 2018) was −0.59 (t = −2.06; df = 8; p = 0.07). Provincial reductions in medical opioid dispensing indicated (near-)significant correlations with fentanyl contribution rates to opioid-related death totals. Differential reductions in pharmaceutical opioid availability may have created supply voids for nonmedical use, substituted with synthetic/toxic (e.g., fentanyl) opioids and leading to accelerated opioid mortality. Implications of these possible unintended adverse consequences warrant consideration for public health policy.","Jones, Wayne; Lee, Min-Hye (Angelica); Kaoser, Ridhwana; Fischer, Benedikt",Int J Environ Res Public Health,389,1

The phytosynthesized FeNPs exhibited UV–visible absorption peaks at 229 nm and its crystalline nature was confirmed through XRD. FT-IR analysis revealed the presence of various functional groups which are responsible for the bioreduction of FeNPs. The SEM results showed that FeNPs were aggregated, irregular sphere shaped with rough surfaces and EDX spectrum recorded densely occupied iron nanoparticles region. The particle size range of the synthesized iron nanoparticles was 185.6 nm. The FeNPs showed potential methylene blue decolourisation activity which was visually observed by gradual colour change in the dye solution from deep blue to colorless. The control exhibited no change in coloration during exposure to sunlight and the iron nanoparticles completely disintegrated the methylene blue within 10 s in 10 mg/L methylene blue (98%), whereas the color change was decreased when the concentration of the dye increased. In addition, the phyto-synthesized FeNPs exhibited extensive antibacterial and antifungal activity against the selected pathogens. Phytotoxicity assay confirms the potential of biosynthesized iron nanoparticles as a fertilizer for the growth of green gram seeds. Thus the present study leads to development of cost-effective green synthesis, reduction of toxic chemicals and its extensive applications in the biological sciences.","Dharshini, Rajathirajan Siva; Poonkothai, Mani; Srinivasan, Palanisamy; Mythili, Raja; Syed, Asad; Elgorban, Abdallah M.; Selvankumar, Thangasamy; Kim, Woong",Appl Nanosci,389,30

Indeed endothelial cells are mechanosensors that integrate the forces in the form of biochemical signals. The cytoskeleton is fundamental in sensing mechanical stimuli and activating specific signaling pathways. Because the cytoskeleton is very rapidly remodeled in endothelial cells exposed to microgravity, we investigated whether the disruption of actin polymerization by cytochalasin D in 1g condition triggers and orchestrates responses similar to those occurring in micro- and macro-vascular endothelial cells upon gravitational unloading. We focused our attention on the effect of simulated microgravity on stress proteins and transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7), a cation channel that acts as a mechanosensor and modulates endothelial cell proliferation and stress response. Simulated microgravity downregulates TRPM7 in both cell types. However, 24 h of treatment with cytochalasin D decreases the amounts of TRPM7 only in macrovascular endothelial cells, suggesting that the regulation and the role of TRPM7 in microvascular cells are more complex than expected. The 24 h culture in the presence of cytochalasin D mimics the effect of simulated microgravity in modulating stress response in micro- and macro-vascular endothelial cells. We conclude that cytoskeletal disruption might mediate some effects of microgravity in endothelial cells.","Locatelli, Laura; Maier, Jeanette A. M.",Front Cell Dev Biol,389,1

In practice, significant uncertainty is associated with estimates of these parameters, and this uncertainty must be considered in the analysis of the model. The objective of this paper is to propose a sensitivity analysis approach for a queueing model, presenting parameters that follow a Gaussian distribution. The approach consists in decomposing the output of the model (stationary distribution of the model) into a polynomial chaos. The sensitivity indices, allowing to quantify the contribution of each parameter to the variance of the output, are obtained directly from the coefficients of decomposition. The proposed approach is then applied to M/G/1/N queueing model. The most influential parameters are highlighted. Finally several numerical and data examples are sketched out to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method and compare them with Monte Carlo simulation.

The transportation sector is a crucial player in the country’s economy, but at the same time, it is also a significant contributor to climate change. Since climate change is a global threat, most transportation policies eventually lead to solving the climate change problem to achieve sustainable transportation. Despite commitments from various countries, the carbon emissions are still to come down and require the implementation of ambitious policies. Globally, countries are increasingly putting more effort towards sustainable transportation through various policy initiatives, and so does India. Given the growing transport-related externalities, the policy stance of India towards urban transportation is also gradually shifting to a systems approach from supply-oriented to demand-oriented policies. This paper highlights the significant transportation problems faced in India and how the Government of India’s transportation sector policy interventions for cities have evolved since its independence. The challenges and gaps in the existing policies are discussed, and possible ways to frame the policies are presented. This study finds that most government policy initiatives are still to see the intended level of success. This is majorly due to lack of monitoring, complex institutional capacities and urban governance, irregular zoning of land and inefficient comprehensive development and mobility plans.","Verma, Ashish; Harsha, Vajjarapu; Subramanian, Gayathri Harihara",Transp,389,16

The sample consists of 379 basic-year medical students. Off them, 160 (42.4%) were male and 218 (57.5%) were female. The following measures were used in the study: The Medical Student Stressor Questionnaire (MSSQ), Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire—Short Form (TEIQue-ASF), The anxiety symptoms scale and the depression scale. RESULTS: The majority of students reported high to severe level ARS and mild to moderate DRS. Female students showed higher levels of ARS, TLRS, SRS, GARS and anxiety symptoms compared to male ones. Moreover, students with higher levels of academic performance reported lower levels of ARS and DRS, higher levels of trait EI and lower levels of anxiety and depression symptoms. In addition, trait EI has a significant negative association with anxiety and depression symptoms and stress domains (ARS, IRS, TLRS, SRS, DRS, GARS) and total stress. Finally, stress domains are positively correlated with anxiety and depression symptoms. CONCLUSION: Basic-year medical students in the Gaza Strip are exposed to stressful events which aggravate the effect of exposure and cause higher levels of anxiety and depression symptoms.","El-Khodary, Basel; Alshawamreh, Siham; Salah, Mariam Abu; Hamada, Amro; Alhendawi, Baraa; Alhabil, Mohammed; Alemour, Younis; Zaqout, Hadil; Wadi, Ezz Aldeen",Middle East Curr Psychiatry,389,24

Sequence variability among NWM glycoproteins (GP) poses a challenge to the development of broadly neutralizing therapeutics against the entire clade of viruses. However, blockade of their shared binding site on the apical domain of human Transferrin Receptor 1 (hTfR1/CD71) presents an opportunity for the development of effective and broadly neutralizing therapeutics. Here we demonstrate that the murine monoclonal antibody OKT9, which targets the apical domain of hTfR1, can sterically block cellular entry by viral particles presenting Clade B NWM glycoproteins (GP1-GP2). OKT9 blockade is also effective against viral particles pseudotyped with glycoproteins of a recently identified pathogenic Sabia-like virus. With nanomolar affinity for hTfR1, the OKT9 antigen binding fragment (OKT9-Fab) sterically blocks Clade B NWM-GP1s and reduces infectivity of an attenuated strain of Junin virus. Binding of OKT9 to the hTfR1 ectodomain in its soluble, dimeric state produces stable assemblies that are observable by negative stain electron microscopy. A model of the OKT9-sTfR1 complex, informed by the known crystallographic structure of sTfR1 and a newly determined structure of the OKT9 antigen binding fragment (Fab) suggests that OKT9 and the Machupo virus GP1 share a binding site on the hTfR1 apical domain. The structural basis for this interaction presents a framework for the design and development of high-affinity, broadly acting agents targeting Clade B NWMs. Importance Pathogenic Clade B NWMs cause grave infectious diseases: the South American hemorrhagic fevers. Their etiological agents are Junin (JUNV), Guanarito (GTOV), Sabiá (SABV), Machupo (MACV), Chapare (CHAV), and a new Sabiá-like (SABV-L) virus recently identified in Brazil. These are priority A pathogens due to their high infectivity and mortality, their potential of person-to-person transmission, and the limited availability of effective therapeutics and vaccines to curb their effects. While low homology between surface glycoproteins of NWMs foils efforts to develop broadly neutralizing therapies targeting NWMs, this work provides structural evidence that OKT9, a monoclonal antibody targeting a single NWM glycoprotein binding site on hTfR1, can efficiently prevent their entry into cells.","Ferrero, Sol; Flores, Maria D; Short, Connor; Vazquez, Cecilia A; Clark, Lars E; Ziegenbein, James; Zink, Samantha; Fuentes, Daniel; Payes, Cristian; Batto, María V; Collazo, Michael; García, Cybele C; Abraham, Jonathan; Cordo, Sandra M; Rodriguez, Jose A; Helguera, Gustavo",Journal of virology,389,24

METHOD A comprehensive literature search including grey literature was conducted to identify controlled outcome studies on the PCOMS, randomized (RCTs), or non-randomized trials (N-RCT). RESULTS The literature search identified 18 studies, 14 RCTs, and four N-RCTs, including altogether 2910 participants. The meta-analysis of all studies found a small overall effect of using the PCOMS on general symptoms (g = 0.27, p = .001). The heterogeneity of the results was substantial. Moderation analyses revealed no effect of the PCOMS in psychiatric settings (g = 0.10, p = .144), whereas a positive effect was found in counseling settings (g = 0.45, p < .001), although almost all of these studies were characterized by a positive researcher allegiance and using the PCOMS Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) as the only outcome measure. CONCLUSION The meta-analysis revealed a small overall effect of using the PCOMS, but no effect in psychiatric settings.

Here, we summarize data on the baseline clinical characteristics and routine care available to patients at four clinics in Eastern Uganda as a prelude to a clinical trial. Methods: Between February and August 2018, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of patients attending four SCD clinics in Mbale, Soroti, Atutur and Ngora, all in Eastern Uganda, the planned sites for an upcoming clinical trial (H-PRIME: ISRCTN15724013). Data on socio-demographic characteristics, diagnostic methods, clinic schedules, the use of prophylactic and therapeutic drugs, clinical complications and patient understanding of SCD were collected using a structured questionnaire. Results: Data were collected on 1829 patients. Their ages ranged from 0 to 64 years with a median (IQR) of 6 (3-11) years. 49.1% of participants were male. The majority (1151; 62.9%) reported a positive family history for SCD. Approximately half knew that SCD is inherited from both parents but a substantial proportion did not know how SCD is transmitted and small numbers believed that it is acquired by either transfusion or from other people. Only 118/1819 (6.5%) participants had heard about or were using hydroxyurea while 356/1794 (19.8%) reported stigmatization. Participants reported a median of three (IQR 1-4) hospital admissions during the preceding 12 months; 80.8% had been admitted at least once, while 14.2% had been admitted more than five times. Pain was the most common symptom, while 83.9% of those admitted had received at least one blood transfusion. Conclusion: The majority of patients attending SCD clinics in Eastern Uganda are children and few are currently being treated with hydroxyurea. The data collected through this facility-based survey will provide background data that will be useful in planning for the H-PRIME trial.","Olupot-Olupot, Peter; Wabwire, Ham; Ndila, Carolyne; Adong, Ruth; Ochen, Linus; Amorut, Denis; Abongo, Grace; Okalebo, Charles B; Akello, Sarah Rachael; Oketcho, Joy B; Okiror, William; Asio, Sarah; Odiit, Amos; Alaroker, Florence; Nyutu, Gideon; Maitland, Kathryn; Williams, Thomas N",Wellcome open research,389,26

Selection criteria have been well established by professional societies and research studies support the selection bias benefitting appropriately selected patients. The primary benefit of outpatient thyroidectomy reported is a decrease in cost, though additional theoretical benefits such as decreased exposure to nosocomial infections. SUMMARY Outpatient thyroidectomy is a well tolerated approach in appropriately selected candidates, with cost reduction benefits. Adherence to societal guidelines for patient selection is paramount.","Romero Arenas, Minerva Angélica","Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",389,1

BACKGROUND Being prepared for disasters can minimize damage to our health, lives, and property. Families with young children are particularly vulnerable during disasters. METHODS A questionnaire was distributed to a convenience sample of families with young children in March and September in 2008. RESULTS A total of 198 out of 220 questionnaires distributed to heads of households were collected and analyzed for this study. Most of the householders (94.4%) considered the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong in 2003 to have been a disaster. They considered that the disastrous events most likely to occur in Hong Kong were infectious disease outbreaks (96.5%) and major transport accidents (94.4%). In preparing for unexpected events, these families reported having stocked up on ''young children's necessities'' (82.8%, 73.7%) and ''medications'' (82.8%, 60.1%) sufficient for three and seven days respectively. These families also kept a flashlight with adequate batteries (74.7%), extra blankets (69.2%), and a first aid kit (60.6%) at home for safety. They reported ''panic buying'' for necessities during previous typhoon strikes (68.2%) and infectious disease outbreaks (46.0%). Only 9.1% considered themselves adequately prepared for disasters (9.1%). CONCLUSIONS Although the families with young children in this study are prepared for disaster to some extent, their preparedness is still considered grossly inadequate and in need of public attention.","Fung, Olivia Wai Man; Loke, Alice Yuen",Scandinavian journal of public health,389,9

However, the subjective assessment of radiographic examination is a time-consuming task and demands expert radiologists. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have enhanced the diagnostic power of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools and assisted medical specialists in making efficient diagnostic decisions. In this work, we propose an optimal multilevel deep-aggregated boosted network to recognize COVID-19 infection from heterogeneous radiographic data, including X-ray and CT images. Our method leverages multilevel deep-aggregated features and multistage training via a mutually beneficial approach to maximize the overall CAD performance. To improve the interpretation of CAD predictions, these multilevel deep features are visualized as additional outputs that can assist radiologists in validating the CAD results. A total of six publicly available datasets were fused to build a single large-scale heterogeneous radiographic collection that was used to analyze the performance of the proposed technique and other baseline methods. To preserve generality of our method, we selected different patient data for training, validation, and testing, and consequently, the data of same patient were not included in training, validation, and testing subsets. In addition, fivefold cross-validation was performed in all the experiments for a fair evaluation. Our method exhibits promising performance values of 95.38%, 95.57%, 92.53%, 98.14%, 93.16%, and 98.55% in terms of average accuracy, F-measure, specificity, sensitivity, precision, and area under the curve, respectively and outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.","Owais, Muhammad; Lee, Young Won; Mahmood, Tahir; Haider, Adnan; Sultan, Haseeb; Park, Kang Ryoung",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,389,31

The objective of this study is to introduce how a group of vascular surgery residencies joined forces to improve surgical education in times of COVID-19. METHODS On May 2020, a group of Hispanic American vascular residency programs created webinar sessions of arterial and venous clinical cases among vascular residents across Latin America and Europe. Participants were surveyed via email. Questions were about the perceived quality and utility of the webinars; answers were stratified into negative (disagree), neutral, and positive (agree). RESULTS There have been 60 sessions and 118 clinical cases presented. The survey was answered by 106 participants, 82 males (78.8%) and 24 women (23.0%). Fifty-four (51.9%) were board-certified vascular surgeons, 49 (47.1%) vascular surgery residents, and 2 (1.9%) general surgery residents. Mean age of the participants was 41.5 years (range: 25-74 years). Mean years of vascular surgery practice or experience were 11.2 years (range: 0-45 years). The residency programs involved in this project were from 13 different countries. Most answers received were positive for both perceived quality and utility of the webinars. CONCLUSION Globalization and technology provide an opportunity for international education, with the goal of building well-rounded and academic vascular surgeons. This group is just the beginning of a large collaborative group among Hispanic American countries, hoping that more residency programs will join, with the aim of breaking borders in the education of vascular surgery.","Fabiani, Mario Alejandro; Gonzalez-Urquijo, Mauricio; Cassagne, Gabriela; Dominguez, Angeles; Hinojosa-Gonzalez, David Eugenio; Lozano-Balderas, Gerardo; Cisneros Tinoco, Miguel Ángel; Escotto Sanchez, Ignacio; Esperón Percovich, Alejandro; Vegas, Diego Herrera; Mariné Massa, Leopoldo; Mertens, Renato A; Morelli, Luis; Sepulveda Monsalve, Gustavo; Sanchez Nicolat, Nora; Perez Damian, Venancio; Riambau, Vicente; Vaquero Puerta, Carlos; Zaefferer, Patricio",Vascular,389,4

Since activation of RNase L during infection typically limits virus production dramatically, we used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology to knockout (KO) targeted host genes involved in the RNase L pathway to evaluate the effects of RNase L on ZIKV infection in human A549 cells. RNase L was activated in response to ZIKV infection, which degraded ZIKV genomic RNA. Surprisingly, despite viral genome reduction, RNase L activity did not reduce ZIKV infectious titers. In contrast, both the flavivirus dengue virus as well as the alphavirus Sindbis virus replicated to significantly higher titers in RNase L KO cells compared to wild-type (WT) cells. Using MAVS/RNase L double KO cells, we demonstrated that the absence of increased ZIKV production in RNase L KO cells was not due to compensation by enhanced type I IFN transcripts to thus inhibit virus production. Finally, when synthetic dsRNA was used to activate OAS3 and induce RNase L antiviral activity prior to ZIKV infection, we observed reduced ZIKV replication factory (RF) formation as well as a 42-fold reduction in virus yield in WT but not RNase L KO cells. This study proposes that ZIKV evades RNase L antiviral activity by generating a viral genome reservoir protected from RNase L cleavage during early infection, allowing for sufficient virus production before RNase L activation is detectable.ImportanceWith the onset of the 2015 ZIKV outbreak, ZIKV pathogenesis has been of extreme global public health interest, and a better understanding of interactions with the host would provide insight into molecular mechanisms driving the severe neurological outcomes of ZIKV disease. Herein is the initial report on the relationship between ZIKV and the host oligoadenylate synthetase-RNase L (OAS-RNase L) system, a potent antiviral pathway effective at restricting replication of diverse viruses. Our study elucidated a unique mechanism whereby ZIKV production is impervious to antiviral RNase L activity, through a mechanism of viral RNA protection that is not mimicked during infection with numerous other RNase L-activating viruses, thus identifying a distinct replication strategy potentially important for ZIKV pathogenesis.","Whelan, Jillian N; Li, Yize; Silverman, Robert H; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,389,1

Various fixation systems were critically compared in terms of their retention strength and the formation of adhesions. METHODS In a prospective study with 25 Sprague-Dawley rats, two pieces of Parietex composite meshes measuring 2 x 3 cm were fixed intraperitoneally in a paramedian location. The randomized mesh fixation groups included transfascial fixed suture, ProTack, AbsorbaTack, and I-Clip. Of the 25 rats, 12 were killed and analyzed 1 week after implantation, with the remaining 13 rats killed and analyzed after 2 months. Adhesions observed at the time of mesh removal were measured according to an adhesion scoring system, and the fixation strengths of the individual fixation systems were tested. Additionally, the foreign body reaction to the mesh and fixation systems was measured as well as their potential degradation. RESULTS After 1 week, the retention strength of transfascial fixed suture was significantly higher (8.7 N/cm(2)) than that of ProTack (5.6 N/cm(2)) or AbsorbaTack (5.7 N/cm(2)). After 2 months, the retention strength had increased to 13.2 N/cm(2) in the transfascial fixed suture group, which was significantly higher than in the ProTack (9.7 N/cm(2)) or AbsorbaTack (8.7 N/cm(2)) groups. In contrast, the mesh could be fixed with the I-Clip only in 56% of the cases, and then achieved rather poor retention strength. Adhesion was significantly greater in the ProTack group than in any of the other groups (p < 0.001). At 2 months, scanning electron microscopy showed only marginal degradation of the absorbable elements. CONCLUSIONS Suture fixation led to satisfactory attachment of the prosthesis. Additional widespread anchorage of the mesh was achieved with ProTack or AbsorbaTack. The feasibility and retention strength of the I-Clip were poor.","Hollinsky, Christian; Kolbe, Thomas; Walter, Ingrid; Joachim, Anja; Sandberg, Simone; Koch, Thomas; Rülicke, Thomas; Tuchmann, Albert",Surgical endoscopy,389,1

The most common path - ogens are viruses (47% rotavirus, 29% norovirus, and 14% adenovirus). METHODS This review is based on publications retrieved by a selective search in PubMed employing the terms ""acute gastro - enteritis children"" AND ""dehydration"" OR ""rehydration"" OR ""prevention,"" and by manual searching (based, for example, on reference lists and expert knowledge), with subsequent evaluation including consideration of the relevant guidelines. RESULTS The degree of dehydration can be judged from weight loss and other clinical findings. In 17 randomized controlled trials conducted on a total of 1811 children with mild or moderate dehydration, oral rehydration with oral rehydration solution was just as effective as intravenous rehydration with respect to weight gain, duration of diarrhea, and fluid administration, and was associated with shorter hospital stays (weighted mean difference, -1.2 days; 95% confidence interval [-2.38; -0.02]). Oral rehydration therapy failed in 4% of patients [1; 7]. In children who are vomiting or who refuse oral rehydration solution, continuous nasogastric application is just as effective as intravenous rehydration and is the treatment of first choice. CONCLUSION In Germany, children with mild or moderate dehydration are often hospitalized for intravenous rehydration therapy, despite the good evidence supporting ambulatory oral rehydration. Obstacles to intersectoral care, the nursing shortage, and inadequate reimbursement must all be overcome in order to reduce unnecessary hospitalizations and thereby lessen the risk of nosocomial infection.","Posovszky, Carsten; Buderus, Stephan; Classen, Martin; Lawrenz, Burkhard; Keller, Klaus-Michael; Koletzko, Sibylle",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,389,1

One way to do this is through visual impairment simulations. The aim of this review is to synthesize and assess the types of simulation methods that have been used to simulate age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in normally sighted participants, during activities of daily living (e.g., reading, cleaning, and cooking). Methods: We conducted a systematic literature search in five databases and a critical analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of various AMD simulation methods (following PRISMA guidelines). The review focuses on the suitability of each method for investigating activities of daily living, an assessment of clinical validation procedures, and an evaluation of the adaptation periods for participants. Results: Nineteen studies met the criteria for inclusion. Contact lenses, computer manipulations, gaze contingent displays, and simulation glasses were the main forms of AMD simulation identified. The use of validation and adaptation procedures were reported in approximately two-thirds and half of studies, respectively. Conclusions: Synthesis of the methodology demonstrated that the choice of simulation has been, and should continue to be, guided by the nature of the study. While simulations may never completely replicate vision loss experienced during AMD, consistency in simulation methodology is critical for generating realistic behavioral responses under vision impairment simulation and limiting the influence of confounding factors. Researchers could also come to a consensus regarding the length and form of adaptation by exploring what is an adequate amount of time and type of training required to acclimatize participants to vision impairment simulations.","Macnamara, Anne; Chen, Celia; Schinazi, Victor R; Saredakis, Dimitrios; Loetscher, Tobias",Frontiers in neuroscience,389,1

People with mental disorders have high rates of co-morbidity and significantly poorer oral health outcomes than the general public. However, their oral health remains largely a hidden and neglected issue. A complex range of factors impact the oral health of this group. These include anxiety and dental phobia, dietary habits, including the heavy consumption of sugary drinks, substance misuse of tobacco, alcohol, and/or psychostimulants, the adverse orofacial side effects of anti-psychotic and anti-depression medications, and financial, geographic, and social barriers to accessing oral health care. Methods The aim of this realist systematic review is to (a) identify and synthesise evidence that explores oral health interventions for people living with mental disorders; (b) explore the context and mechanisms that have contributed to the success of interventions or the barriers and challenges; (c) produce program theories on causal, contextual and mechanistic factors to facilitate outcomes and (d) produce recommendations and guidelines to guide future oral health interventions for people with mental disorders at both the policy and practice level. Using a five-step process, that incorporates primary data collection from key stakeholders, a beginning theoretical framework will be developed to describe contextual and mechanistic factors and how they might impact on the success or failure of oral health interventions for people with mental disorders. Key database searches will be conducted, with data extraction focused on the factors that might have impacted on intervention implementation and outcomes. Quality appraisal of studies will occur, and the theoretical framework will be populated with extracted data. Stakeholder input will support the development and refinement of a theory on oral health interventions for people with mental disorders.

Computed tomography (CT) has been widely used in the diagnosis of this novel pneumonia. This study aims to understand the role of CT for the diagnosis and the main imaging manifestations of patients with COVID-19. Methods We conducted a rapid review and meta-analysis on studies about the use of chest CT for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We comprehensively searched databases and preprint servers on chest CT for patients with COVID-19 between 1 January 2020 and 31 March 2020. The primary outcome was the sensitivity of chest CT imaging. We also conducted subgroup analyses and evaluated the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results A total of 103 studies with 5,673 patients were included. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results as reference, a meta-analysis based on 64 studies estimated the sensitivity of chest CT imaging in COVID-19 was 99% (95% CI, 0.97-1.00). If case reports were excluded, the sensitivity in case series was 96% (95% CI, 0.93-0.99). The sensitivity of CT scan in confirmed patients under 18 years old was only 66% (95% CI, 0.15-1.00). The most common imaging manifestation was ground-glass opacities (GGO) which was found in 75% (95% CI, 0.68-0.82) of the patients. The pooled probability of bilateral involvement was 84% (95% CI, 0.81-0.88). The most commonly involved lobes were the right lower lobe (84%, 95% CI, 0.78-0.90) and left lower lobe (81%, 95% CI, 0.74-0.87). The quality of evidence was low across all outcomes.

Although glucose metabolism in neurons and astrocytes has been extensively studied, the glucose metabolism of microglia and oligodendrocytes, and their interactions with neurons and astrocytes, remain critical to understand brain function. Brain regions with heterogeneous cell composition and cell-type-specific profiles of glucose metabolism suggest that metabolic networks within the brain are complex. Signal transduction proteins including those in the Wnt, GSK-3β, PI3K-AKT, and AMPK pathways are involved in regulating these networks. Additionally, glycolytic enzymes and metabolites, such as hexokinase 2, acetyl-CoA, and enolase 2, are implicated in the modulation of cellular function, microglial activation, glycation, and acetylation of biomolecules. Given these extensive networks, glucose metabolism dysfunction in the whole brain or specific cell types is strongly associated with neurologic pathology including ischemic brain injury and neurodegenerative disorders.

Intracerebral hemorrhage as a complication of cranioplasty is rare, and it is often fatal. The report describes one case of delayed severe intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage after an uneventful cranioplasty. CASE PRESENTATION A previously healthy 29-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with a traumatic left frontotemporoparietal acute subdural hematoma, an emergency decompressive craniectomy with clot removal was performed. Four months after the surgery, cranioplasty was performed with a titanium mesh, the surgery was uneventful. Six hours after the operation, a CT scan demonstrated no bleeding or edema. In the following 2 days after cranioplasty, the patient did not have any neurological deficits, normal blood pressure was recorded every day, no trauma occurred, and routine laboratory test results were within normal limits. However, on the third day after cranioplasty, the patient suffered a sudden severe headache while playing games on his mobile phone, and then rapidly fell into deep coma; both pupils were fixed and dilated at 5 mm with no response to light. An immediate CT scan revealed a massive intracerebral hematoma and intraventricular hematoma on the left side, and the midline shifted to the right side. Therefore, an ipsilateral decompressive craniectomy was performed with evacuation of the hematoma; the obvious bleeding point was not identified, and no obvious vascular abnormalities were found during the operation. A CT scan on day 3 after reoperation revealed successful decompression, and CT angiography showed no vascular abnormalities. Despite all treatment measures, the patient did not regain consciousness, his neurological situation did not improve after the operation, and the patient lived in a vegetative state. CONCLUSION Although intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage after cranioplasty is extremely rare, it is often fatal. Aside from hyperperfusion and cerebral autoregulation dysfunction, traction injuries to the fragile vessels due to posttraumatic angiogenesis may also be one of the key factors of complications after cranioplasty.","Xiao, Zongyu",British journal of neurosurgery,389,1

Noninvasive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of stenotic lesions may enhance therapeutic decision-making. We determined whether physiologic parameters change downstream cerebral hemodynamics in patients with ICAS. METHODS Consecutive ICAS patients who underwent both CT angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography were enrolled. CFD models were made using CTA source images. Inlet boundary conditions were defined using three ranges of systolic blood pressure (BP) (109.2, 158, and 225 mmHg) and hematocrit (27.3, 40.2, and 48.8). Ratios of pressure, shear strain rates (SSR), and flow velocity across the lesion were calculated using CFD simulations. A linear mixed model was used for the statistical analysis of repeated simulations. RESULTS Among the 56 patients, 32 had moderate stenosis (50-69%) and 24 had severe stenosis (70-99%). A linear mixed model revealed that the ratio of pressure was predicted by systolic BP and stenosis group interaction (P = .036). These pressure decreases were associated with systolic BP (P < .001) and stenosis group (P < .001), but not with hematocrit (P = .337). Post-hoc analysis revealed that pressure decreases were more profound in the severe stenosis than the moderate stenosis group when comparing high and low systolic BP (P = .0108). Ratios of SSR and velocity were only associated in the stenosis group. CONCLUSIONS Our study showed that systolic BP along with the degree of stenosis was associated with pressure decreases across stenotic lesions. Physiologic conditions may superimpose further changes in post-stenotic or downstream blood flow.","Nam, Hyo Suk; Scalzo, Fabien; Leng, Xinyi; Ip, Hing Lung; Lee, Hye Sun; Fan, Florence; Chen, Xiangyan; Soo, Yannie; Miao, Zhongrong; Liu, Liping; Feldmann, Edward; Leung, Thomas; Wong, Ka Sing; Liebeskind, David S",Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,389,1

AIMS We explored factors associated with such discrepancies between post-treatment infarct volume (PIV) and functional outcome. METHODS We identified patients with small PIV (volume ≤ 25th percentile) and large PIV (volume ≥ 75th percentile) on 24-48-h CT/MRI in the ESCAPE randomized-controlled trial. Demographics, comorbidities, baseline, and 24-48-h stroke severity (NIHSS), stroke location, treatment type, post-stroke complications, and other outcome scales like Barthel Index, and EQ-5D were compared between ""discrepant cases"" - those with 90-day modified Rankin Scale(mRS) ≤ 2 despite large PIV or mRS ≥ 3 despite small PIV - and ""non-discrepant cases"". Multi-variable logistic regression was used to identify pre-treatment and post-treatment factors associated with small-PIV/mRS ≥ 3 and large-PIV/mRS ≤ 2. Sensitivity analyses used different definitions of small/large PIV and good/poor outcome. RESULTS Among 315 patients, median PIV was 21 mL; 27/79 (34.2%) patients with PIV ≤ 7 mL (25th percentile) had mRS ≥ 3; 12/80 (15.0%) with PIV ≥ 72 mL (75th percentile) had mRS ≤ 2. Discrepant cases did not differ by CT versus MRI-based PIV ascertainment, or right versus left-hemisphere involvement (p = 0.39, p = 0.81, respectively, for PIV ≤ 7 mL/mRS ≥ 3). Pre-treatment factors independently associated with small-PIV/mRS ≥ 3 included older age (p = 0.010), cancer, and vascular risk-factors; post-treatment factors included 48-h NIHSS (p = 0.007) and post-stroke complications (p = 0.026). Absence of vascular risk-factors (p = 0.004), CT-based lentiform nucleus sparing (p = 0.002), lower 24-hour NIHSS (p = 0.001), and absence of complications (p = 0.013) were associated with large-PIV/mRS ≤ 2. Sensitivity analyses yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS Discrepancies between functional ability and PIV are likely explained by differences in age, comorbidities, and post-stroke complications, emphasizing the need for high-quality post-thrombectomy stroke care.

A nationwide lockdown of two months imposed across India amid COVID-19 led to a dramatic decline in major sources of emissions except for household, mainly from cooking. This initially led to declined levels of CO in two of the largest megacities of India, Delhi and Mumbai under stable weather conditions, followed by a distinctly different variability under the influence of prevailing mesoscale circulation. We hereby trace the sources of CO from local emissions to transport pathways and interpret the observed variability in CO using the interactive WRF-Chem model and back trajectory analysis. For this purpose, COVID-19 emission inventory of CO has been estimated. Model results indicate a significant contribution from externally generated CO in Delhi from surrounding regions and an unusual peak on 17th May amid lockdown due to long range transport from the source region of biofuel emissions in central India. However, the oceanic winds played a larger role in keeping CO levels in check in a coastal megacity Mumbai which otherwise has high CO emissions from household sources due to a larger share of urban slums. Keeping track of evolving carbon-intensive pathways can help inform government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic to prioritize controls of emissions sources.","Beig, Gufran; Korhale, Nikhil; Rathod, Aditi; Maji, Sujit; Sahu, Saroj K; Dole, Shruti; Latha, R; Murthy, B S",Environmental pollution,389,19

METHODS From 22 March to 3 June 2020, 2581 COVID-19 patients were identified from 18 European hospitals. Epidemiological and clinical data were extracted at baseline and within the 2-month post-infection. RESULTS The prevalence of OD was significantly higher in mild form (85.9%) compared with moderate-to-critical forms (4.5-6.9%; P = 0.001). Of the 1916 patients with OD, 1363 completed the evaluations (71.1%). A total of 328 patients (24.1%) did not subjectively recover olfaction 60 days after the onset of the dysfunction. The mean duration of self-reported OD was 21.6 ± 17.9 days. Objective olfactory evaluations identified hyposmia/anosmia in 54.7% and 36.6% of mild and moderate-to-critical forms, respectively (P = 0.001). At 60 days and 6 months, 15.3% and 4.7% of anosmic/hyposmic patients did not objectively recover olfaction, respectively. The higher baseline severity of objective olfactory evaluations was strongly predictive of persistent OD (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION OD is more prevalent in mild COVID-19 forms than in moderate-to-critical forms.

Protease inhibitors blocking the replication of coronavirus (CoV), including the causative agents of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), provide a promising foundation for the development of anticoronaviral therapeutics. However, the selection and consequences of inhibitor-resistant CoVs are unknown. In this study, we exploited the model coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), to investigate the genotype and phenotype of MHV quasispecies selected for resistance to a broad-spectrum CoV 3C-like protease (3CLpro) inhibitor. Clonal sequencing identified single or double mutations within the 3CLpro coding sequence of inhibitor-resistant virus. Using reverse genetics to generate isogenic viruses with mutant 3CLpros, we found that viruses encoding double-mutant 3CLpros are fully resistant to the inhibitor and exhibit a significant delay in proteolytic processing of the viral replicase polyprotein. The inhibitor-resistant viruses also exhibited postponed and reduced production of infectious virus particles. Biochemical analysis verified double-mutant 3CLpro enzyme as impaired for protease activity and exhibiting reduced sensitivity to the inhibitor and revealed a delayed kinetics of inhibitor hydrolysis and activity restoration. Furthermore, the inhibitor-resistant virus was shown to be highly attenuated in mice. Our study provides the first insight into the pathogenicity and mechanism of 3CLpro inhibitor-resistant CoV mutants, revealing a low genetic barrier but high fitness cost of resistance. Importance: RNA viruses are infamous for their ability to evolve in response to selective pressure, such as the presence of antiviral drugs. For coronaviruses such as the causative agent of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), protease inhibitors have been developed and shown to block virus replication, but the consequences of selection of inhibitor-resistant mutants have not been studied. Here, we report the low genetic barrier and relatively high deleterious consequences of CoV resistance to a 3CLpro protease inhibitor in a coronavirus model system, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). We found that although mutations that confer resistance arise quickly, the resistant viruses replicate slowly and do not cause lethal disease in mice. Overall, our study provides the first analysis of the low barrier but high cost of resistance to a CoV 3CLpro inhibitor, which will facilitate the further development of protease inhibitors as anti-coronavirus therapeutics.","Deng, Xufang; StJohn, Sarah E; Osswald, Heather L; O'Brien, Amornrat; Banach, Bridget S; Sleeman, Katrina; Ghosh, Arun K; Mesecar, Andrew D; Baker, Susan C",Journal of virology,389,23

The spike (S) glycoprotein has been identified as a major component of protective immunity, and 23 different amino acid changes were noted during the expanding epidemic. Using a panel of SARS-CoV recombinants bearing the S glycoproteins from isolates representing the zoonotic and human early, middle, and late phases of the epidemic, we identified 23 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with neutralizing activity against one or multiple SARS-CoV spike variants and determined the presence of at least six distinct neutralizing profiles in the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. Four of these MAbs showed cross-neutralizing activity against all human and zoonotic S variants in vitro, and at least three of these were mapped in distinct epitopes using escape mutants, structure analyses, and competition assays. These three MAbs (S109.8, S227.14, and S230.15) were tested for use in passive vaccination studies using lethal SARS-CoV challenge models for young and senescent mice with four different homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV S variants. Both S227.14 and S230.15 completely protected young and old mice from weight loss and virus replication in the lungs for all viruses tested, while S109.8 completely protected mice from weight loss and clinical signs in the presence of viral titers. We conclude that a single human MAb can confer broad protection against lethal challenge with multiple zoonotic and human SARS-CoV isolates, and we identify a robust cocktail formulation that targets distinct epitopes and minimizes the likely generation of escape mutants.","Rockx, Barry; Corti, Davide; Donaldson, Eric; Sheahan, Timothy; Stadler, Konrad; Lanzavecchia, Antonio; Baric, Ralph",Journal of virology,389,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a monocentric single operator study on 187 consecutive RALP. Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (standard anastomosis, until December 2017) and Group 2 (sub-sphincteric anastomosis (SSA), since January 2018). The SSA consisted in respecting the sphincteric sleeve during the anastomosis suturing only the internal layer of the urethra with the bladder and thereby avoiding the loss of sphincteric length induced by the suture. Pre, intra and postoperative data were prospectively collected and compared. Criteria of continence were: no pad use and complete absence of leakage at catheter removal at 1 month and 1 year. RESULTS The two groups were comparable in terms of PSA, gland volume and Gleason score. In group 2 (SSA), we observed a complete continence recovery in 75.6 % at catheter removal (p=0.0000035), in 82.9 % at 1 month (p=0.000092), and in 97.5% at 1 year (p=0.028), independently of bladder neck preservation (p=0.388). There was also a significant difference between the 2 groups concerning urinary reeducation requirement (p=0.0006), pad use and urinary quality of life (p=0.0000002). No anastomosis complication were reported. CONCLUSIONS The SSA significantly improved the rates of immediate, early and 1 year continence recovery after RALP.

We found that the Cdc42-activated polarity kinase Pak1 colocalizes with the assembling contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and remains at the division site during septation. Mutations in pak1 led to defects in CAR assembly and genetic interactions with cytokinesis mutants. Through a phosphoproteomic screen, we identified novel Pak1 substrates that function in polarized growth and cytokinesis. For cytokinesis, we found that Pak1 regulates the localization of its substrates Mid1 and Cdc15 to the CAR. Mechanistically, Pak1 phosphorylates the Mid1 N-terminus to promote its association with cortical nodes that act as CAR precursors. Defects in Pak1-Mid1 signaling lead to misplaced and defective division planes, but these phenotypes can be rescued by synthetic tethering of Mid1 to cortical nodes. Our work defines a new signaling mechanism driven by a cell polarity kinase that promotes CAR assembly in the correct time and place.","Magliozzi, Joseph O; Sears, Jack; Cressey, Lauren; Brady, Marielle; Opalko, Hannah E; Kettenbach, Arminja N; Moseley, James B",The Journal of cell biology,389,12

Although it has been suggested that elevated levels of blood neutrophils associate with worsening oxygenation in COVID-19, it is unknown whether neutrophils are drivers of the thrombo-inflammatory storm or simple bystanders. To better understand the potential role of neutrophils in COVID-19, we measured levels of the neutrophil activation marker S100A8/A9 (calprotectin) in hospitalized patients and determined its relationship to severity of illness and respiratory status. Patients with COVID-19 (n = 172) had markedly elevated levels of calprotectin in their blood. Calprotectin tracked with other acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, and absolute neutrophil count, but was superior in identifying patients requiring mechanical ventilation. In longitudinal samples, calprotectin rose as oxygenation worsened. When tested on day 1 or 2 of hospitalization (n = 94 patients), calprotectin levels were significantly higher in patients who progressed to severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation (8039 ± 7031 ng/ml, n = 32) as compared to those who remained free of intubation (3365 ± 3146, P < 0.0001).

In this study, we examined the effects of the NSAID diclofenac on the breaking strength of an experimental colonic anastomosis and a skin incision as well as subcutaneous collagen accumulation. METHODS This was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled experimental study in 60 male Wistar rats treated with diclofenac 4 mg/kg/day or placebo. In each rat, a colonic anastomosis was performed and an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) tube was placed subcutaneously. Incisional and anastomotic wound breaking strength and hydroxyproline content in the ePTFE tubes were measured 7 days after the operation. RESULTS We found no significant differences in any of the breaking strength measurements, but showed a median 38% reduction in hydroxyproline deposition as a result of diclofenac treatment (p = 0.03). In the placebo group, subcutaneous collagen deposition tended to correlate positively with skin incisional but negatively with anastomotic bio-mechanical strength. CONCLUSION Postoperative diclofenac treatment significantly inhibited collagen deposition in subcutaneous granulation tissue. Anastomotic strength and skin wound strength were not significantly affected. The ePTFE model is suitable for assessing the effect of various drugs on collagen formation and thus on wound healing.","Klein, M; Krarup, P-M; Kongsbak, M B; Agren, M S; Gögenur, I; Jorgensen, L N; Rosenberg, J",European surgical research.

Traditionally the discipline focuses on eukaryotes, with the study of bacteria and viruses complementary but distinct. Nonetheless, parasites vary in size and complexity from single celled protozoa, to enormous plants like those in the genus Rafflesia. Lifecycles range from obligate intracellular to extensive exoparasitism. Examples of parasites include high-profile medical and zoonotic pathogens such as Plasmodium, veterinary pathogens of wild and captive animals and many of the agents which cause neglected tropical diseases, stretching to parasites which infect plants and other parasites (e.g. Kikuchi et al. 2011; Hotez et al. 2014; Blake et al. 2015; Hemingway, 2015; Meekums et al. 2015; Sandlund et al. 2015). The breadth of parasitology has been matched by the variety of ways in which parasites are studied, drawing upon biological, chemical, molecular, epidemiological and other expertise. Despite such breadth bridging between disciplines has commonly been problematic, regardless of extensive encouragement from government agencies, peer audiences and funding bodies promoting multidisciplinary research. Now, progress in understanding and collaboration can benefit from establishment of the One Health concept (Zinsstag et al. 2012; Stark et al. 2015). One Health draws upon biological, environmental, medical, veterinary and social science disciplines in order to improve human, animal and environmental health, although it remains tantalizingly difficult to engage many relevant parties. For infectious diseases traditional divides have been exacerbated as the importance of wildlife reservoirs, climate change, food production systems and socio-economic diversity have been recognized but often not addressed in a multidisciplinary manner. In response the 2015 Autumn Symposium organized by the British Society for Parasitology (BSP; https://www.bsp.uk.net/home/) was focused on One Health, running under the title 'One Health: parasites and beyond…'. The meeting, held at the Royal Veterinary College (RVC) in Camden, London from September 14th to 15th, drew upon a blend of specialist parasitology reinforced with additional complementary expertise. Scientists, advocates, policy makers and industry representatives were invited to present at the meeting, promoting and developing One Health understanding with relevance to parasitology. The decision to widen the scope of the meeting to non-parasitological, but informative topics, is reflected in the diversity of the articles included in this special issue.

Identification of cellular factors involved in PRRSV life cycle not only will enable a better understanding of virus biology but also has the potential for the development of antiviral therapeutics. The PRRSV nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) has been shown to be involved in at least two important functions in the infected hosts: (i) mediation of viral subgenomic (sg) mRNA transcription and (ii) suppression of the host's innate immune response mechanisms. To further our understanding of the role of the viral nsp1 in these processes, using nsp1β, a proteolytically processed functional product of nsp1 as bait, we have identified the cellular poly(C)-binding proteins 1 and 2 (PCBP1 and PCBP2) as two of its interaction partners. The interactions of PCBP1 and PCBP2 with nsp1β were confirmed both by coimmunoprecipitation in infected cells and/or in plasmid-transfected cells and also by in vitro binding assays. During PRRSV infection of MARC-145 cells, the cytoplasmic PCBP1 and PCBP2 partially colocalize to the viral replication-transcription complexes. Furthermore, recombinant purified PCBP1 and PCBP2 were found to bind the viral 5' untranslated region (5'UTR). Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of PCBP1 and PCBP2 in cells resulted in significantly reduced PRRSV genome replication and transcription without adverse effect on initial polyprotein synthesis. Overall, the results presented here point toward an important role for PCBP1 and PCBP2 in regulating PRRSV RNA synthesis.","Beura, Lalit K; Dinh, Phat X; Osorio, Fernando A; Pattnaik, Asit K",Journal of virology,389,27

It is pointed out that such information is in the public interest because it will inform critical care facilities on how to save lives of future patients and assist government in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic by adequate planning. It is also reasonably justifiable in the public interest to ascertain the COVID-19 status of deceased persons who may have been exposed to the virus, in order to protect their family, friends, healthcare practitioners, undertakers and staff members, and members of the public with whom they have been in contact. Finally, it is suggested that the law can be clarified by amending the Disaster Management COVID-19 regulations to do away with consent for such autopsies or tissue sample collections from deceased persons exposed to the risk of contracting the virus, subject to certain conditions.","McQuoid-Mason, D J",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,389,30

METHODS We prospectively enrolled 77 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 infection admitted to our intermediate care unit in Pisa between March 5 and March 30, 2020, with follow up until hospital discharge or death. Logistic regression was used identify variables potentially associated with adverse outcomes and those P <0.10 were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model. Cumulative probability for lack of adverse outcomes in patients with or without low baseline diaphragm muscle mass was calculated with the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator. RESULTS The main findings of this study are that 1) patients who developed adverse outcomes had thinner diaphragm than those who did not (2.0 vs. 2.2 mm, P=0.001), 2) DT and lymphocyte count were independent significant predictors of adverse outcomes, with end-expiratory DT being the strongest (ß=-708; OR=0.492; P=0.018). CONCLUSIONS Diaphragmatic ultrasound may be a valid tool to evaluate the risk of respiratory failure. Evaluating the need of mechanical ventilation treatment should be based not only on PaO2/FiO2, but on a more comprehensive assessment including DT because if the lungs become less compliant a thinner diaphragm, albeit free of intrinsic abnormality, may become exhausted, thus contributing to severe respiratory failure.","Corradi, Francesco; Isirdi, Alessandro; Malacarne, Paolo; Santori, Gregorio; Barbieri, Greta; Romei, Chiara; Bove, Tiziana; Vetrugno, Luigi; Falcone, Marco; Bertini, Pietro; Guarracino, Fabio; Landoni, Giovanni; Forfori, Francesco",Minerva anestesiologica,389,8

The aim of this study was to investigate the optimum intravenous access time and to evaluate the corresponding bispectral index (BIS) value in pediatric patients after sevoflurane induction. Method This prospective study included 100 children enrolled between January 1, 2017 and January 1, 2018 at Istanbul Medeniyet University Goztepe Training and Research Hospital. Anesthesia was induced with 8% sevoflurane and oxygen. Measurements included mask adaptation time, time to loss of the ciliary reflex, time to recovery of regular breathing, and optimal timing of intravenous access time with the corresponding BIS values, as well as the time elapsed for the BIS value to fall below 60. Results The mean mask adaptation time was 27.8±28.4 s, time to loss of the ciliary reflex was 39.7±10.3 s, and time to reach regular respiration was 88.5±116.9 s, with mean BIS value of 80.4±16.9, 70.2±10.4, and 52.4±12.1, respectively. The mean time for BIS to fall below 60 was 72.54±24.41 s. The mean time required for the the iniation of optimal intravenous access was 104.92±36.45 s, with a mean BIS value of 30±10.1. Conclusion Following anesthesia induction with sevoflurane in children, the BIS value below 60 which is the upper limit for surgical anesthesia, was found to be insufficient for intravenous intervention. For pediatric patients undergoing sevoflurane induction it has been concluded that, the BIS value below 30 or an average waiting time of 104.9 s is ideal for initiation of optimal intravenous access.","Orhon, Zeynep Nur; Orhon, Cem",Medeniyet medical journal,389,33

STUDY DESIGN We conducted a qualitative study with semi-structured telephone interviews with individuals who completed a medication abortion by mail through the TelAbortion study. We asked participants how they learned about telemedicine abortion, reasons for choosing it, what their alternative would have been, and about their experience. We transcribed, coded, and performed qualitative content analysis of the interviews and are presenting a subset of themes related to access to care when the restrictions on clinic dispensing of mifepristone are removed. RESULTS We interviewed 45 people from January to July 2020. Direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion was more convenient and accessible than in-clinic abortion care when considering the burdens of travel, clinic availability, logistics, and cost that were associated with in-clinic abortion. Stigma led to a prioritization of privacy, and by going to a clinic, participants feared a loss of privacy whereas obtaining a medication abortion by mail made it easier to maintain confidentiality. Faced with these barriers, 13% of participants stated they would have continued their pregnancy if TelAbortion had not been an option. Participants found direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion to be acceptable and recommended it to others. Benefits of telemedicine were amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic due to concerns around infection exposure with in-clinic care. CONCLUSION Going to a clinic was a burden for participants, to the point where some would not have otherwise been able to get an abortion. Medication abortion by mail with telemedicine counseling was a highly acceptable alternative. IMPLICATIONS Medication abortion by mail can increase access to abortion with the added benefits of increased perceived privacy and decreased logistical burdens. Removing the in-person dispensing requirement for mifepristone would allow direct-to-patient telemedicine abortion to be implemented outside of a research setting without compromising the patient experience.","Kerestes, Courtney; Delafield, Rebecca; Elia, Jennifer; Chong, Erica; Kaneshiro, Bliss; Soon, Reni",Contraception,389,1

We hypothesised that sensory processing, in particular pain, differs in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic AF. METHODS Thirty individuals with permanent AF (15 symptomatic and 15 asymptomatic) completed the Atrial Fibrillation 6 (AF6) and short form 36 Health Survey questionnaires and underwent quantitative pain sensitisation testing using pressure algometry at the sternum (referred pain area) and the tibialis anterior muscle (generalised pain area). The primary objective was to assess differences in pressure pain thresholds (PPT), temporal summation of pain (TSP) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM) in the two groups. The secondary objective was to determine association of demographic and clinical parameters to measures of pain sensitisation. RESULTS The symptomatic group had lower PPTs at both tibialis (p=0.004) and sternum (p=0.01), and impaired CPM (p=0.025) and facilitated TSP (p=0.008) at the tibialis but not sternum, compared with the asymptomatic group. The AF6 sum score was negatively correlated to PPT on both tibialis (r=-0.50, p=0.005) and sternum (r=-0.42, p=0.02) and positively correlated to TSP on both tibialis (r=0.57, p=0.001) and sternum (r=0.45, p=0.01), but not to CPM. The physical component summary score was positively correlated to the PPT on both tibialis (r=0.52, p=0.003) and sternum (r=0.40, p=0.03) and negatively to TSP on the tibialis (r=-0.53, p=0.003) but not sternum. CONCLUSIONS Patients with symptomatic AF exhibit lower pain tolerance than patients with asymptomatic AF, as well as impaired pain inhibitory control and facilitated summation of pain, indicating that pain sensitisation may be of importance in symptomatic AF.Trial registration numberNCT04649437.","Jackson, Adam; Frobert, Ole; Boye Larsen, Dennis; Arendt-Nielsen, Lars; Björkenheim, Anna",Open heart,389,19

The current standard is QuikClot Combat Gauze packing, which requires 3 min of compression. We have created a novel dressing with calcium carbonate microparticles that can disperse and self-propel upstream against flowing blood. We loaded these microparticles with thrombin and tranexamic acid and tested their efficacy in a swine arterial bleeding model without wound compression. Anesthetized immature female swine received 5 mm femoral arteriotomies to induce severe junctional hemorrhage. Wounds were packed with kaolin-based QuikClot Combat Gauze (KG), propelled thrombin-microparticles with protonated tranexamic acid (PTG), or a non-propelling formulation of the same thrombin-microparticles with non-protonated tranexamic acid (NPTG). Wounds were not compressed after packing. Each animal then received one 15 mL/kg bolus of hydroxyethyl starch solution followed by Lactated Ringer as needed for hypotension (maximum: 100 mL/kg) for up to 3 h. Survival was improved with PTG (3-h survival: 8/8, 100%) compared with KG (3/8, 37.5%) and NPTG (2/8, 25%) (P <0.01). PTG animals maintained lower serum lactate and higher hemoglobin concentrations than NPTG (P <0.05) suggesting PTG decreased severity of subsequent hemorrhagic shock. However, total blood loss, Lactated Ringer infusion volumes, and mean arterial pressures of surviving animals were not different between groups (P >0.05). Thus, in this swine model of junctional arterial hemorrhage, gauze with self-propelled, prothrombotic microparticles improved survival and 2 indicators of hemorrhagic shock when applied without compression, suggesting this capability may enable better treatment of non-compressible junctional wounds.","Baylis, James R; St John, Alexander E; Wang, Xu; Lim, Esther B; Statz, Matthew L; Chien, Diana; Simonson, Eric; Stern, Susan A; Liggins, Richard T; White, Nathan J; Kastrup, Christian J",Shock,389,1

In the absence of language, autonomic activity can provide crucial information about cognitive and affective states during single-unit recording, inactivation and lesion studies. Methods standardized for use in humans are not easily adapted to NHPs and detailed guidance has been lacking. NEW METHOD We provide guidance for monitoring heart rate and pupil size in the behavioral neurophysiology setting by addressing the methodological issues, pitfalls and solutions for NHP studies. The methods are based on comparative physiology to establish a rationale for each solution. We include examples from both electrophysiological and lesion studies. RESULTS Single-unit recording, pupil responses and heart rate changes represent a range of decreasing temporal resolution, a characteristic that impacts experimental design and analysis. We demonstrate the unexpected result that autonomic measures acquired before and after amygdala lesions are comparable despite disruption of normal autonomic function. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS Species and study design differences can render standard techniques used in human studies inappropriate for NHP studies. We show how to manage data from small groups typical of NHP studies, data from the short behavioral trials typical of neurophysiological studies, issues associated with longitudinal studies, and differences in anatomy and physiology. CONCLUSIONS Autonomic measurement to infer cognitive and affective states in NHP is neither off-the-shelf nor onerous. Familiarity with the issues and solutions will broaden the use of autonomic signals in NHP single unit and lesion studies.","Mitz, Andrew R; Chacko, Ravi V; Putnam, Philip T; Rudebeck, Peter H; Murray, Elisabeth A",Journal of neuroscience methods,389,19

Novel techniques that objectively confirm diagnoses are needed. This study details the development and validation of a melanoma prediction model from spatially resolved multivariate protein expression profiles generated by Imaging Mass Spectrometry (IMS). METHODS Three board-certified dermatopathologists blindly evaluated 333 samples. Samples with triply concordant diagnoses were included in this study, divided into a training set (n = 241) and a test set (n = 92). Both the training and test sets included various representative subclasses of unambiguous nevi and melanomas. A prediction model was developed from the training set using a linear support vector machine (SVM) classification model. RESULTS We validated the prediction model on the independent test set of 92 specimens (75 classified correctly, two misclassified, and 15 indeterminate). IMS detects melanoma with a sensitivity of 97.6% and a specificity of 96.4% when evaluating each unique spot. IMS predicts melanoma at the sample level with a sensitivity of 97.3% and a specificity of 97.5%. Indeterminate results were excluded from sensitivity and specificity calculations.

Here we report that the replication of the arteriviruses equine arteritis virus (EAV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is strongly affected by low-micromolar concentrations of cyclosporine A (CsA), an inhibitor of members of the cyclophilin (Cyp) family. In infected cells, the expression of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene inserted into the PRRSV genome was inhibited with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 5.2 μM, whereas the GFP expression of an EAV-GFP reporter virus was inhibited with an IC(50) of 0.95 μM. Debio-064, a CsA analog that lacks its undesirable immunosuppressive properties, inhibited EAV replication with an IC(50) that was 3-fold lower than that of CsA, whereas PRRSV-GFP replication was inhibited with an IC(50) similar to that of CsA. The addition of 4 μM CsA after infection prevented viral RNA and protein synthesis in EAV-infected cells, and CsA treatment resulted in a 2.5- to 4-log-unit reduction of PRRSV or EAV infectious progeny. A complete block of EAV RNA synthesis was also observed in an in vitro assay using isolated viral replication structures. The small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of Cyp family members revealed that EAV replication strongly depends on the expression of CypA but not CypB. Furthermore, upon fractionation of intracellular membranes in density gradients, CypA was found to cosediment with membranous EAV replication structures, which could be prevented by CsA treatment. This suggests that CypA is an essential component of the viral RNA-synthesizing machinery.","de Wilde, Adriaan H; Li, Yanhua; van der Meer, Yvonne; Vuagniaux, Grégoire; Lysek, Robert; Fang, Ying; Snijder, Eric J; van Hemert, Martijn J",Journal of virology,389,28

We sought to quantify complex plaques in patients with STEMI referred for primary PCI and to determine their effect on short- and long-term clinical outcomes by examining the core laboratory database for plaque analysis from the Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction study. Baseline demographic, angiographic, and procedural details were compared between patients with single versus multiple complex plaques who underwent single-vessel PCI. Multivariable analysis was performed for predictors of long-term major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), a combined end point of death, reinfarction, ischemic target-vessel revascularization, or stroke, and for death alone. Single-vessel PCI was performed in 3,137 patients (87%): 2,174 (69%) had multiple complex plaques and 963 (31%) had a single complex plaque. Compared with those with a single complex plaque, patients with multiple complex plaques were older (p <0.0001) and had more co-morbidities. The presence of multiple complex plaques was an independent predictor of 3-year MACE (hazard ratio 1.58, 95% confidence interval 1.26 to 1.98, p <0.0001), and death alone (hazard ratio 1.68, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 2.70, p = 0.03). In conclusion, multiple complex plaques are present in the majority of patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI, and their presence is an independent predictor of short- and long-term MACE, including death (Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction; NCT00433966).","Keeley, Ellen C; Mehran, Roxana; Brener, Sorin J; Witzenbichler, Bernhard; Guagliumi, Giulio; Dudek, Dariusz; Kornowski, Ran; Dressler, Ovidiu; Fahy, Martin; Xu, Ke; Grines, Cindy L; Stone, Gregg W",The American journal of cardiology,389,16

Some cancer cells, however, develop escape mechanisms to evade detection and destruction. One of these mechanisms is the expression of cell surface proteins which allow the cancer cell to bind to proteins on T cells called checkpoints to switch off and effectively evade T-cell-mediated destruction. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are antibodies that block the binding of cancer cell proteins to T-cell checkpoints, preventing the T-cell response from being turned off by cancer cells and enabling killer T cells to attack. In other words, ICIs restore innate antitumor immunity, as opposed to traditional chemotherapies that directly kill cancer cells. Given their relatively excellent risk-benefit ratio when compared to other forms of cancer treatment modalities, ICIs are now becoming ubiquitous and have revolutionized the treatment of many types of cancer. Indeed, the prognosis of some patients is so much improved that the threshold for admission for intensive care should be adjusted accordingly. Nevertheless, by modulating immune checkpoint activity, ICIs can disrupt the intricate homeostasis between inhibition and stimulation of immune response, leading to decreased immune self-tolerance and, ultimately, autoimmune complications. These immune-related adverse events (IRAEs) may virtually affect all body systems. Multiple IRAEs are common and may range from mild to life-threatening. Management requires a multidisciplinary approach and consists mainly of immunosuppression, cessation or postponement of ICI treatment, and supportive therapy, which may require surgical intervention and/or intensive care. We herein review the current literature surrounding IRAEs of interest to anesthesiologists and intensivists.

The aims of this study were to assess and compare miRNA expression profiles in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) following three different kinds of peripheral nerve injury, including spinal nerve ligation (SNL), dorsal root transection (DRT), and ventral root transection (VRT), in Sprague-Dawley rats. Responses to thermal and mechanical stimuli were measured preoperatively and on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 4, and 7. A miRNA microarray analysis was used to detect the miRNA expression profiles in injured L5 DRG from SNL, DRT, and VRT on POD 7. Validation of miRNA expression was performed by qPCR and in situ hybridization. Rats receiving SNL displayed significantly higher mechanical hypersensitivity, but those receiving DRT developed higher thermal hypersensitivity. The number of miRNAs that were significantly upregulated in L5 DRG was 49 (7.2%), 25 (3.7%), and 146 (21.5%) following SNL, DRT, and VRT, respectively. On the other hand, 35 (5.1%) miRNAs were significantly downregulated in the SNL group, 21 (3.1%) miRNAs in the DRT group, and 41 (6.0%) miRNAs in the VRT group. Of the four miRNAs that were mutually aberrant in all three models, two were significantly upregulated (twofold), miR-21 and miR-31, and two were significantly downregulated, miR-668 and miR-672. Using in situ hybridization, miRNA-21, miRNA-31, miRNA-668, and miRNA-672 were found to localize to neurons in the DRG.

Many viruses, including coronavirus, herpesvirus and retrovirus, co-opt host cellular TER94 for optimal viral invasion and replication. Previous proteomics analysis identified the association of TER94 with the budded virions (BVs) of baculovirus, an enveloped insect large DNA virus. Here, the role of TER94 in the prototypic baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) life cycle was investigated. In virus-infected cells, TER94 accumulated in virogenic stroma (VS) at the early stage of infection and subsequently partially rearranged to the ring zone region. In the virions, TER94 was associated with the nucleocapsids of both BV and occlusion-derived virus (ODV). Inhibition of TER94 ATPase activity significantly reduced viral DNA replication and BV production. Electron/immunoelectron microscopy revealed that inhibition of TER94 resulted in the trapping of nucleocapsids within cytoplasmic vacuoles at the nuclear periphery for BV formation and blockage of ODV envelopment at a pre-mature stage within infected nuclei, which appeared highly consistent with its pivotal function in membrane biogenesis. Further analyses showed that TER94 was recruited to the VS or subnuclear structures through interaction with viral early proteins LEF3 and helicase, whereas inhibition of TER94 activity blocked the proper localization of replication-related viral proteins and morphogenesis of VS, providing an explanation for its role in viral DNA replication. Taken together, these data indicated the crucial functions of TER94 at multiple steps of baculovirus life cycle including genome replication, BV formation, and ODV morphogenesis.IMPORTANCE TER94 constitutes an important AAA+ ATPase that associates with diverse cellular processes including protein quality control, membrane fusion of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum network, nuclear envelope reformation, and DNA replication. To date, little is known regarding the role(s) of TER94 in the baculovirus life cycle. In this study, TER94 was found to play a crucial role in multiple steps of baculovirus infection including viral DNA replication and BV- and ODV formation. Further evidence showed that the membrane fission/fusion function of TER94 is likely to be exploited by baculovirus for virion morphogenesis. Moreover, TER94 could interact with the viral early proteins LEF3 and helicase to transport to and further recruit viral replication-related proteins to establish viral replication factories. This study highlights the critical roles of TER94 as an energy-supplying chaperon in the baculovirus life cycle and enriches our knowledge regarding the biological function of this important host factor.","Li, Yimeng; Hu, Liangbo; Chen, Tong; Chang, Meng; Deng, Fei; Hu, Zhihong; Wang, Hualin; Wang, Manli",Journal of virology,389,31

The popular high-end cardiac health monitoring systems such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography scan (CT scan), and echocardiography (Echo) are highly expensive and do not support long-term continuous monitoring of patients without disrupting their activities of daily living (ADL). In this paper, the continuous and non-invasive cardiac health monitoring using unobtrusive sensors is explored aiming to provide a feasible and low-cost alternative to foresee possible cardiac anomalies in an early stage. It is learned that cardiac health monitoring based on sole usage of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals may not provide powerful insights as ECG provides shallow information on various cardiac activities in the form of electrical impulses only. Hence, a novel low-cost, non-invasive seismocardiogram (SCG) signal along with ECG signals are jointly investigated for the robust cardiac health monitoring. For this purpose, the in-laboratory data collection model is designed for simultaneous acquisition of ECG and SCG signals followed by mechanisms for the automatic delineation of relevant feature points in acquired ECG and SCG signals. In addition, separate feature points based novel approach is adopted to distinguish between normal and abnormal morphology in each ECG and SCG cardiac cycle. Finally, a combined analysis of ECG and SCG is carried out by designing a Naïve Bayes conditional probability model. Experiments on Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved licensed ECG/SCG signals acquired from real subjects containing 12,000 cardiac cycles show that the proposed feature point delineation mechanisms and abnormal morphology detection methods consistently perform well and give promising results. In addition, experimental results show that the combined analysis of ECG and SCG signals provide more reliable cardiac health monitoring compared to the standalone use of ECG and SCG.","Sahoo, Prasan Kumar; Thakkar, Hiren Kumar; Lin, Wen-Yen; Chang, Po-Cheng; Lee, Ming-Yih",Sensors,389,1

Perioperative hemodynamic optimization utilizing Goal Directed Therapy (GDT) has attracted considerable interest within the last decade due to its ability to improve postoperative short and long-term outcomes in patients undergoing higher risk surgeries. The concept of GDT in this context can be loosely defined as collecting data from minimally invasive hemodynamic monitors with the intention of using such data (flow-related parameters and/or dynamic parameters of fluid responsiveness) to titrate therapeutic interventions (intravenous fluids and/or inotropic therapy administration) with the ultimate aim of optimizing end organ tissue perfusion. Recently, the increasing amount of evidence supporting the implementation of GDT strategies has been considered so robust as to allow for the creation of national recommendations in the United Kingdom (UK), France, and Europe. These recommendations from such influential scientific societies and the potential clinical and economic benefits of GDT protocols need to also be examined within the current shift from a ""pay for service"" to a ""pay for performance"" health care system. This shift is strongly encouraged within emerging systems such as the Perioperative Surgical Home (PSH) paradigm from the United States. As a result, hospitals and clinicians around the world have become increasingly incentivized to implement perioperative hemodynamic optimization using GDT strategies within their departments. Unfortunately, its adoption continues to be quite limited and a lack of standardized criteria for perioperative fluid administrations has resulted in significant clinical variability among practitioners. This current review will provide a brief up-to-date overview of GDT, discuss current clinical practice, analyze why implementation has been limited and finally, describe the newer closed-loop GDT concept along with its potential risks and benefits.","Joosten, Alexandre; Alexander, Brenton; Delaporte, Amélie; Lilot, Marc; Rinehart, Joseph; Cannesson, Maxime",Anaesthesiology intensive therapy,389,1

We aimed to assess the accuracy of endoluminal confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) and laparoscopic fluorescence-based enhanced reality (FLER), using near-infrared imaging and fluorescence from injected Indocyanine Green, to identify the transition from ischemic to vascular areas in a porcine model of mesenteric ischemia. METHODS Six pigs underwent 1-h sigmoid segmental ischemia. The ischemic area was evaluated by clinical assessment and FLER to determine presumed viable margins. For each sigmoid colon, 5 regions of interest (ROIs) were identified: ischemic (ROI 1), presumed viable margins ROI 2a (distal) and 2b (proximal), and vascular areas 3a (distal) and 3b (proximal). After injection of fluorescein, CLE scanning of the mucosa from the ischemic area toward viable margins was performed. Capillary blood samples were obtained by puncturing the serosa at the ROIs, and capillary lactates were measured with the EDGE(®) analyzer. RESULTS Capillary lactates were significantly higher at ROI 1 (4.91 mmol/L) when compared to resection margins (2.8 mmol/L; mean difference: 2.11; p < 0.05) identified by FLER. There was no significant difference in lactates between ROI1 and resection margins identified by clinical evaluation. In 50 % of cases, ROI 2aCLINIC-2bCLINIC were considered to match (<1 cm distance) with ROI 2aFLER-2bFLER. Confocal analysis revealed specific clues to identify the transition from ischemic to viable areas corresponding to those assessed by FLER in 11/12 cases versus 7/12 for those identified by clinical evaluation. CONCLUSIONS In this experimental model, FLER and CLE were more accurate than clinical evaluation to delineate bowel vascularization.","Diana, Michele; Dallemagne, Bernard; Chung, Hyunsoo; Nagao, Yoshihiro; Halvax, Peter; Agnus, Vincent; Soler, Luc; Lindner, Veronique; Demartines, Nicolas; Diemunsch, Pierre; Geny, Bernard; Swanström, Lee; Marescaux, Jacques",Surgical endoscopy,389,1

In recent years, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is the third highly pathogenic event and large-scale epidemic affecting the human population. It follows the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. This novel SARS-CoV-2 employs the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, like SARS-CoV, and spreads principally in the respiratory tract. The viral spike (S) protein of coronaviruses facilities the attachment to the cellular receptor, entrance, and membrane fusion. The S protein is a glycoprotein and is critical to elicit an immune response. Glycosylation is a biologically significant post-translational modification in virus surface proteins. These glycans play important roles in the viral life cycle, structure, immune evasion, and cell infection. However, it is necessary to search for new information about viral behavior and immunological host's response after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present review discusses the implications of the CoV-2 S protein glycosylation in the SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 interaction and the immunological response. Elucidation of the glycan repertoire on the spike protein can propel research for the development of an appropriate vaccine.","Ramírez Hernández, Eleazar; Hernández-Zimbrón, Luis Fernando; Martínez Zúñiga, Nayeli; Leal-García, Juan José; Ignacio Hernández, Violeta; Ucharima-Corona, Luis Eduardo; Pérez Campos, Eduardo; Zenteno, Edgar",Viral immunology,389,28

METHODS Male patients (ASA physical status 1 or 2), scheduled for elective radical retropubic prostatectomy, were allocated to receive sevoflurane general anaesthesia with conventional or heated humidified ventilation. Bronchial mucus transport velocity was assessed via fibreoptic bronchoscope and methylene blue dye at 3h after induction of anaesthesia. RESULTS Median (SE) bronchial mucus transport velocity was significantly higher in the heated humidified group (n = 26) than the conventional ventilation group (n = 24) (1.7 [0.3] mm/min vs 0.9 [0.1] mm/min).

METHODS We conducted a single-site qualitative analysis of EC documentation for all patients receiving ECMO support from 15 August 2018 to 15 May 2019 (n=68). Detailed analysis of 20 ethically complex cases with protracted ethics involvement identifies four key ethical domains: limits of prognostication, bridge to nowhere, burden of treatment and system-level concerns. There are three subthemes: relevant contextual factors, the role of EC and observed outcomes. Content analysis of transcripts from interviews with 20 members of the multidisciplinary ECMO team yields supplemental data on providers' perceptions of the impact of the early intervention protocol. RESULTS Limited outcome data for ECMO, unclear indications for withdrawal, adverse effects of treatment and an obligation to attend to programme metrics present significant ethical challenges in the care of this patient population. Upstream EC mitigates ethical conflict by setting clear expectations about ECMO as a time limited trial, promoting consistent messaging among multiple services and supporting surrogate decision-makers. When ECMO becomes a 'bridge to nowhere', EC facilitates decision-making that respects patient values yet successfully sets limits on non-beneficial use of this novel therapy. CONCLUSION Data from this study support the conclusion that ECMO poses unique ethical challenges that necessitate a standardised protocol for early, routine EC-at least while this medical technology is in its nascent stages.","Wirpsa, M Jeanne; Carabini, Louanne M; Neely, Kathy Johnson; Kroll, Camille; Wocial, Lucia D",Journal of medical ethics,389,1

The objective of the present study was to investigate this question with the rate of R0 resection and long-term survival as endpoints. METHODS This retrospective observational study included prospectively collected data from 40 patients operated laparoscopically with curative intent for exocrine pancreatic malignancies identified among 250 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic pancreatic operations since 1997. All 40 patients had histologically verified exocrine pancreatic carcinoma. RESULTS Ten patients (25%) with typical ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were deemed nonresectable by laparoscopic staging. Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was performed in 29 patients; 8 resections were combined with resections of adjacent organs and 1 removal of a malignant intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm what appeared to be ectopic pancreatic tissue. In 1 patient, the resection was completed by hand-assisted technique, and 1 procedure was converted to open resection. Postoperative morbidity was 23% (n = 7). The median hospital stay was 5 days (range, 1-30). The rate of R0 resections was 93%. Postoperative 3-year survivals rates were 36% for the entire cohort (n = 30) and 30% in typical ductal adenocarcinoma (n = 21). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy for exocrine pancreatic carcinoma is comparable with outcomes after open surgery and supports the concept that laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is a safe, oncologic procedure.","Marangos, Irina Pavlik; Buanes, Trond; Røsok, Bård I; Kazaryan, Airazat M; Rosseland, Arne R; Grzyb, Krzysztof; Villanger, Olaug; Mathisen, Øystein; Gladhaug, Ivar P; Edwin, Bjørn",Surgery,389,28

Here we analyzed disease severity and immune cell changes during and after SARS-CoV-2 infection in 236 participants from South Africa, of which 39% were people living with HIV (PLWH), during the first and second (beta dominated) infection waves. The second wave had more PLWH requiring supplemental oxygen relative to HIV negative participants. Higher disease severity was associated with low CD4 T cell counts and higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratios (NLR). Yet, CD4 counts recovered and NLR stabilized after SARS-CoV-2 clearance in wave 2 infected PLWH, arguing for an interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and HIV infection leading to low CD4 and high NLR. The first infection wave, where severity in HIV negative and PLWH was similar, still showed some HIV modulation of SARS-CoV-2 immune responses. Therefore, HIV infection can synergize with the SARS-CoV-2 variant to change COVID-19 outcomes.","Karim, Farina; Gazy, Inbal; Cele, Sandile; Zungu, Yenzekile; Krause, Robert; Bernstein, Mallory; Khan, Khadija; Ganga, Yashica; Rodel, Hylton Errol; Mthabela, Ntombifuthi; Mazibuko, Matilda; Muema, Daniel; Ramjit, Dirhona; Ndung'u, Thumbi; Hanekom, Willem; Gosnell, Bernadett; Lessells, Richard J; Wong, Emily B; de Oliveira, Tulio; Moosa, Yunus; Lustig, Gil; Leslie, Alasdair; Kløverpris, Henrik; Sigal, Alex",eLife,389,17

According to the results of scans of lung lesions via computed tomography (CT), the patients were divided into mild, moderate, and severe groups. The clinical data of the patients were collected, including age, gender, finger pulse oxygen pressure, ventricular rate, body temperature, etc. The correlation between the clinical indicators and the lesions of high-resolution CT (HRCT) and bronchiectasis was analyzed. Among the 115 patients, 82 had no bronchiectasis and 33 had bronchiectasis. The bronchodilation-prone layers mainly included the left and right lower lobe of the lung. The probability of branching in the inflamed area was greater than that in the noninflamed area in patients with COVID-19. There were significant differences in gender, CT lesion range, and number of incidents of bronchiectasis between noninflamed and inflamed areas (P < 0.05). Moreover, there were significant differences in age, total proportion of CT lesions, volume of CT lesions, and total number of patients with bronchiectasis among the three groups (P < 0.05). CT lesion range was positively correlated with the total number of patients with bronchiectasis and patient age (respectively, r = 0.186, P < 0.05; r = 0.029, P < 0.05). The lesion range in HRCT images of lungs in patients with COVID-19 is correlated with bronchodilation.

One of the complications of IDU/IVDU is the risk of infection. Clinical experience has shown that persons who inject drugs (PWID) are hospitalised and re-hospitalised frequently. In Canada there are sparse data about the reasons for which PWID are admitted to hospital and their health trajectories, especially for infectious diseases. There are special concerns regarding PWID with infections who leave the hospital against medical advice and those who leave with a peripherally inserted central catheter line in place for administration of long-term antibiotics or other therapies. Improving our understanding of current programmes and services addressing the prevention and management of infectious diseases and their complications in PWID could lead to focused interventions to enhance care in this population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS An integrative systematic review allows for inclusion of a variety of methodologies to understand a health issue from different viewpoints.

This study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Persian versions of the Acceptance and Action Diabetes Questionnaire (AADQ) and the Diabetes Acceptance and Action Scale for children and adolescents (DAAS), the measures of diabetes-specific psychological flexibility. Methods 196 youth with T1DM completed the DAAS, AADQ (youth-report), Child and Adolescent Mindfulness Measure (CAMM), Emotion Regulation Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (ERQ-CA), and the Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youths (AFQ-Y8). Also, their parents completed AADQ (parent-report). Data analyzed by SPSS V.26 and LISREL 8.8. Results The mean and standard deviation of participants' age was 14.7 ± 2.08.The internal consistency due to Cronbach's alpha method was 0.87, 0.8, 0.84, and 0.83 for DAAS total scores, avoidance, values impairment, and fusion, respectively. The internal consistency of AADQ (both parent-report and youth report) was above 0.8. Test-retest reliability (from 45 participants) with a one-week interval was assessed by the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The DAAS, AADQ-parent report, and AADQ-youth report's reliability coefficients were 0.93, 0.82, and 0.92, respectively. The AADQ (both forms) and DAAS evidence good content validity based on correlations with other measures. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) showed DAAS has the three-factor model, which strongly a suitable model is fitting. EFA also verified the AADQ model fitting. Conclusions In general, these results support the psychometric properties of the Persian versions of DAAS and AADQ among the Iranian youth patients with T1DM.

Yet, the IgG-binding peptides known to date still fall short of the host cell protein (HCP) logarithmic removal value (LRV) set by Protein A media (2.5-3.1). In this study, we present an integrated computational-experimental approach leading to the discovery of peptide ligands that provide HCP LRVs on par with Protein A. First, the screening of 60,000 peptide variants was performed using a high-throughput search algorithm to identify sequences that ensure IgG affinity binding. Select sequences WQRHGI, MWRGWQ, RHLGWF, and GWLHQR were then negatively screened in silico against a panel of model HCPs to ensure the selection of peptides with high binding selectivity. Candidate ligands WQRHGI and MWRGWQ were conjugated to chromatographic resins and characterized by isothermal binding and breakthrough assays to quantify static and dynamic binding capacity (Qmax and DBC10%), respectively. The resulting Qmax were 52.6 mg of IgG per mL of adsorbent for WQRHGI and 57.48 mg/mL for MWRGWQ, while the DBC10% (2 minutes residence time) were 30.1 mg/mL for WQRHGI and 36.4 mg/mL for MWRGWQ. Evaluation of the peptides by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) confirmed the binding energy predicted in silico, and an amino acid scanning study corroborated the affinity-like binding activity of the peptides. WQRHGI-WorkBeads resin was finally characterized by purification of a monoclonal antibody from a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell culture harvest, affording a remarkable HCP LRV of 2.7, and consistent product yield and purity over 100 chromatographic cycles. These results demonstrate the potential of WQRHGI as an effective alternative to Protein A for antibody purification.","Reese, Hannah R; Xiao, Xingqing; Shanahan, Calvin C; Van Den Driessche, George A; Fourches, Denis; Carbonell, Ruben G; Hall, Carol K; Menegatti, Stefano",Journal of chromatography.

This has been particularly important since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, because reducing patient contact can also help to minimise transmission of COVID-19 to outpatients who are at a high risk of COVID-19-triggered complications. In this retrospective study, the clinical effectiveness of intravenous (IV) infusion of flucloxacillin using an elastomeric device was explored in a convenience sample of patients. Patients with three primary infective diagnoses-bloodstream infection, non-vertebral osteomyelitis and vertebral osteomyelitis-were included in the analyses. In non-vertebral osteomyelitis patients, Accufuser antibiotic infusion shortened the course of OPAT care relative to standard antibiotic administration (p<.05). In contrast, in vertebral osteomyelitis patients, it prolonged the course of OPAT care relative to standard administration (p<.05). In patients with bloodstream infections, no significant difference was found between the treatment modes (p=.93). Thus, the clinical effectiveness of Accufuser antibiotic infusion varies among patients with different infective diagnoses, and there seems to be a complex relationship between the method of antibiotic delivery and the patient's condition.","Zhang, Yuhan; Ody, Yun Chun; Davis, Linsey",British journal of community nursing,389,1

Although techniques vary, transfascial suturing of the mesh to the abdominal wall has been proposed as a viable way to fixate the mesh and reduce recurrence rates. We report a 54-year-old woman who had previously undergone a laparoscopic ventral hernia repair following a laparoscopic tubal ligation using a Composix mesh. The patient presented with a symptomatic hernia recurrence. The computed tomography scan showed a periumbilical hernia containing fat. The patient underwent diagnostic laparoscopy and lysis of adhesions. During the lysis of adhesions, a recurrence through the previously placed composite mesh was encountered where holes had been made by the previously placed transfascial sutures. The hernia was reduced, mesh was removed, and an ePTFE mesh was used to repair the hernia. The mechanism of recurrence appeared to be improperly placed transfascial sutures; overly large bites of mesh caused excessive tension and ultimately a hole in the mesh. Hernia recurrence due to mesh or transfascial suture failure is rarely reported and most often caused by inadequate fixation. Our case highlights the need for meticulous placement of transfascial sutures and demonstrates a mechanism of recurrence due to inadequate placement.","Barzana, D; Johnson, K; Clancy, T V; Hope, W W",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,389,19

Regarding drainage modality, in patients with MHO undergoing drainage before potential resection or transplantation, the panel suggests against routine use of PTBD as first-line therapy compared with EBD. In patients with unresectable MHO undergoing palliative drainage, the panel suggests PTBD or EBD. The final decision should be based on patient preferences, disease characteristics, and local expertise. Regarding drainage strategy, in patients with unresectable MHO undergoing palliative stent placement, the panel suggests placement of bilateral stents compared with a unilateral stent in the absence of liver atrophy. Finally, regarding type of stent, in patients with unresectable MHO undergoing palliative stent placement, the panel suggests placing SEMSs or PSs. However, in patients who have a short life expectancy and who place high value on avoiding repeated interventions, the panel suggests using SEMSs compared with PSs.

LTP may be the result of incomplete ablation of the treated tumor. In this study, we determined whether viable tumor cells attached to the needle applicator after ablation was associated with LTP and disease-free survival. METHODS In this prospective study, tissue was collected of 96 consecutive patients who underwent local liver ablations for 130 liver malignancies. Cells and tissue attached to the needle applicators were analyzed for viability using glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase staining and autofluorescence intensity levels of H&E stained sections. Patients were followed-up until disease progression. RESULTS Viable tumor cells were found on the needle applicators after local ablation in 26.7% of patients. The type of needle applicator used, an open approach, and the omission of track ablation were significantly correlated with viable tumor tissue adherent to the needle applicator. The presence of viable cells was an independent predictor of LTP. The attachment of viable cells to the needle applicators was associated with a shorter time to LTP. CONCLUSIONS Viable tumor cells adherent to the needle applicators were found after ablation of 26.7% of patients. An independent risk factor for viable cells adherent to the needle applicators is the omission of track ablation. We recommend using only RFA devices that have track ablation functionality. Adherence of viable tumor cells to the needle applicator after local ablation was an independent risk factor for LTP.","Snoeren, Nikol; Huiskens, Joost; Rijken, Arjen M; van Hillegersberg, Richard; van Erkel, Arian R; Slooter, Gerrit D; Klaase, Joost M; van den Tol, Petrousjka M; Ten Kate, Fibo J W; Jansen, Maarten C; van Gulik, Thomas M",Annals of surgical oncology,389,1

Research in germ-free or gnotobiotic animals has demonstrated the importance of this symbiosis in immune, vascular, hepatic, respiratory and metabolic systems. Disruption of the microbiota can also contribute to disease, and the microbiota has been implicated in numerous intestinal and extra-intestinal pathologies including colorectal cancer. Interactions between host and microbiota can occur either directly or indirectly, via microbial-derived metabolites. In this chapter, we focus on two major products of microbial metabolism, short-chain fatty acids and bile acids, and their role in colorectal cancer. Short-chain fatty acids are the products of microbial fermentation of complex carbohydrates and confer protection against cancer risk, while bile acids are compounds which are endogenous to the host, but undergo microbial modification in the large intestine leading to alterations in their bioactivity. Lastly, we discuss the ability of microbial modulation to mediate cancer risk and the potential to harness this ability as a prophylactic or therapeutic treatment in colorectal cancer.","Keane, J M; Joyce, S A; Gahan, C G M; Hyland, N P; Houston, A",Results and problems in cell differentiation,389,16

Here, we report a new, genetically distinct pegivirus in goose (Anser cygnoides), the first identified in a non-mammalian host species. Goose pegivirus (GPgV) can be propagated in goslings, embryonated goose eggs, and primary goose embryo fibroblasts and is thus the first pegivirus that can be efficiently cultured in vitro Experimental infection of GPgV in goslings via intravenous injection revealed robust replication and shown high lymphotropism. Analysis of the tissue tropism of GPgV revealed that the spleen and thymus were the organs bearing the highest viral loads. Importantly, GPgV could promote clinical manifestations of goose parvovirus infection, reducing weight gain and 7% mortality. This finding contrasts with the lack of pathogenicity that is characteristic of previously reported pegiviruses.IMPORTANCE Members of the Pegivirus genus, family Flaviviridae, widely infect humans and other mammals, but are described as causing persistent infection and lacking pathogenicity. The efficiency of in vitro replication system for pegivirus is poor limiting investigation into viral replication steps. Because of that, the pathogenesis, cellular tropism, route of transmission, biology, and epidemiology of pegiviruses remain largely uncovered. Here, we report a phylogenetically distinct goose pegivirus (GPgV) which should be classified as a new species. GPgV proliferated in cell culture in a species- and cell-type specific manner. Animal experiments shown GPgV lympho-tropism and promotes goose parvovirus clinical manifestations. This study provides the first cell culture model for pegivirus, opening new possibilities for studies of pegivirus molecular biology. More importantly, our finding stand in contrast to the lack of identified pathogenicity of previously reported pegiviruses, which sheds lights on the pathobiology of pegivirus.","Wu, Zhen; Wu, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Wei; Merits, Andres; Simmonds, Peter; Wang, Mingshu; Jia, Renyong; Zhu, Dekang; Liu, Mafeng; Zhao, Xinxin; Yang, Qiao; Wu, Ying; Zhang, ShaQiu; Huang, Juan; Ou, Xumin; Mao, Sai; Liu, YunYa; Zhang, Ling; Yu, YanLing; Tian, Bin; Pan, Leichang; Rehman, Mujeeb Ur; Chen, Shun; Cheng, Anchun",Journal of virology,389,16

OBJECTIVE To characterize the placental pathology findings in a preselected cohort of neonates infected by transplacental transmission arising from maternal infection with SARS-CoV-2, and to identify pathology risk factors for placental and fetal infection. DESIGN Case-based retrospective analysis by a multinational group of 19 perinatal specialists of the placental pathology findings from 2 cohorts of infants delivered to mothers testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 - liveborn neonates infected via transplacental transmission who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 after delivery and had SARS-CoV-2 identified in cells of the placental fetal compartment by molecular pathology; and stillborn infants with syncytiotrophoblast positive for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS In placentas from all 6 liveborn neonates acquiring SARS-CoV-2 via transplacental transmission the syncytiotrophoblast was positive for coronavirus using immunohistochemistry, RNA in situ hybridization, or both. All 6 placentas had chronic histiocytic intervillositis and necrosis of the syncytiotrophoblast. The 5 stillborn/terminated infants had placental pathology findings that were similar including SARS-CoV-2 infection of the syncytiotrophoblast, chronic histiocytic intervillositis and syncytiotrophoblast necrosis. CONCLUSIONS Chronic histiocytic intervillositis together with syncytiotrophoblast necrosis accompany SARS-CoV-2 infection of syncytiotrophoblast in liveborn and stillborn infants. Their coexistence in all placentas from liveborn infants acquiring their infection prior to delivery indicates that that these findings constitute a pathology risk factor for transplacental fetal infection. Potential mechanisms of infection of the placenta and fetus with SARS-CoV-2, and potential future studies, are discussed.","Schwartz, David A; Baldewijns, Marcella; Benachi, Alexandra; Bugatti, Mattia; Collins, Rebecca R J; De Luca, Danièle; Facchetti, Fabio; Linn, Rebecca L; Marcelis, Lukas; Morotti, Denise; Morotti, Raffaella; Parks, W Tony; Patanè, Luisa; Prevot, Sophie; Pulinx, Bianca; Rajaram, Veena; Strybol, David; Thomas, Kristen; Vivanti, Alexandre J",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,389,1

In horses, the CXCL16 gene is located on equine chromosome 11 (ECA11) and encodes a glycosylated, type I transmembrane protein with 247 amino acids. Stable transfection of HEK-293T cells with plasmid DNA carrying EqCXCL16 (HEK-EqCXCL16 cells) increased the proportion of the cell population permissive to EAV infection from <3% to almost 100%. The increase in permissiveness was blocked either by transfection of HEK-EqCXCL16 cells with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) directed against EqCXCL16 or by pretreatment with guinea pig polyclonal antibody against EqCXCL16 protein (Gp anti-EqCXCL16 pAb). Furthermore, using a virus overlay protein-binding assay (VOPBA) in combination with far-Western blotting, gradient-purified EAV particles were shown to bind directly to the EqCXCL16 protein in vitro. The binding of biotinylated virulent EAV strain Bucyrus at 4°C was significantly higher in HEK-EqCXCL16 cells than nontransfected HEK-293T cells. Finally, the results demonstrated that EAV preferentially infects subpopulations of horse CD14(+) monocytes expressing EqCXCL16 and that infection of these cells is significantly reduced by pretreatment with Gp anti-EqCXCL16 pAb. The collective data from this study provide confirmatory evidence that the transmembrane form of EqCXCL16 likely plays a major role in EAV host cell entry processes, possibly acting as a primary receptor molecule for this virus. IMPORTANCE Outbreaks of EVA can be a source of significant economic loss for the equine industry from high rates of abortion in pregnant mares, death in young foals, establishment of the carrier state in stallions, and trade restrictions imposed by various countries. Similar to other arteriviruses, EAV primarily targets cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, which, when infected, are believed to play a critical role in EVA pathogenesis. To this point, however, the host-specified molecules involved in EAV binding and entry into monocytes/macrophages have not been identified. Identification of the cellular receptors for EAV may provide insights to design antivirals and better prophylactic reagents. In this study, we have demonstrated that EqCXCL16 acts as an EAV entry receptor in EAV-susceptible cells, equine monocytes. These findings represent a significant advance in our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms associated with the entry of EAV into susceptible cells.","Sarkar, Sanjay; Chelvarajan, Lakshman; Go, Yun Young; Cook, Frank; Artiushin, Sergey; Mondal, Shankar; Anderson, Kelsi; Eberth, John; Timoney, Peter J; Kalbfleisch, Theodore S; Bailey, Ernest; Balasuriya, Udeni B R",Journal of virology,389,1

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the changes in musculoskeletal problems and psychosocial status of teachers during the COVID-19 pandemic due to online education and to investigate the effects of preventive telerehabilitation applications for musculoskeletal problems. METHODS Forty teachers who conducted online education during the pandemic volunteered to participate in the study. All assessments were performed via online methods. The Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire (CMDQ), ProFitMap-Neck questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI) were used to evaluate musculoskeletal problems; the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to evaluate anxiety and depression, respectively; and the Work-Life Balance Scale (WLBS) was used to evaluate how well individuals achieve this balance. Information about before online education, during online education, and after training was obtained with the assessments. After the first assessment, telerehabilitation, which involved presentations and brochures, was applied to 18 participants willing to participate in the training. RESULTS The ProFitMap, UEFI, and WLBS scores during the online education decreased significantly, while the scores of the CMDQ, ODI, BDI, and BAI during the online education increased significantly compared to the pre-online education scores (p < 0.05). In addition, the total CMDQ, ProFitMap, and ODI scores improved significantly after the training (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Musculoskeletal and psychosocial problems increased in teachers during online education.

A pilot study.,15.131169,5.8755074,2014,"Background Positive impacts of quality improvement initiatives on health care and services have not been substantial. Knowledge translation (KT) strategies (tools, products and interventions) strive to facilitate the uptake of knowledge thereby the potential to improve care, but there is little guidance on how to develop them. Existing KT guidance or planning tools fall short in operationalizing all aspects of KT practice activities conducted by knowledge users (researchers, clinicians, patients, decision-makers), and most do not consider their variable needs or to deliver recommendations that are most relevant and useful for them. Methods We conducted a 3-phase study. In phase 1, we used several sources to develop a conceptual framework for creating optimized Knowledge-activated Tools (KaT) (consultation with our integrated KT team, the use of existing KT models and frameworks, findings of a systematic review of multimorbidity interventions and a literature review and document analysis on existing KT guidance tools). In phase 2, we invited KT experts to participate in a Delphi study to refine and evaluate the conceptual KaT framework. In phase 3, we administered an online survey to knowledge users (researchers, clinicians, decision-makers, trainees) to evaluate the potential usefulness of an online mock-up version of the KaT framework. Results We developed the conceptual KaT framework, and iteratively refined it with 35 KT experts in a 3-round Delphi study. The final framework represents the blueprint for what is needed to create KT strategies. Feedback from 201 researcher, clinician, decision-maker and trainee knowledge users on the potential need and usefulness of an online, interactive version of KaT indicated that they liked the idea of it (mean score 4.36 on a 5-point Likert scale) and its proposed features (mean score range 4.30-4.79). Conclusions Our findings suggest that mostly Canadian KT experts and knowledge users perceived the KaT framework and the future development of an online, interactive version to be important and needed. We anticipate that the KaT framework will provide clarity for knowledge users about how to identify their KT needs and what activities can address these needs, and to help streamline the process of these activities to facilitate efficient uptake of knowledge.","Kastner, Monika; Makarski, Julie; Hayden, Leigh; Lai, Yonda; Chan, Joyce; Treister, Victoria; Harris, Kegan; Munce, Sarah; Holroyd-Leduc, Jayna; Graham, Ian D; Straus, Sharon E",Implementation science communications,389,1

Oligomeric HIV-1 envelope proteins delivered with a potent adjuvant are expected to elicit strong antibody responses with broad neutralization specificity. To test this hypothesis, two SIV envelope proteins were formulated with delta inulin-based adjuvant (Advax) and used to immunize nonhuman primates. Oligomeric gp140-gp145 from SIVmac251 and SIVsmE660 was purified to homogeneity. Oligomers showed high-affinity interaction with CD4 and were highly immunogenic in rabbits, inducing Tier 2 SIV-neutralizing antibodies. The immunogenicity of an oligomeric Env DNA prime and protein boost together with Advax was evaluated in Chinese rhesus macaques. DNA administration elicited antibodies to both envelopes, and titres were markedly enhanced following homologous protein boosts via intranasal and intramuscular routes. Strong antibody responses were detected against the V1 and V2 domains of gp120. During peak immune responses, a low to moderate level of neutralizing activity was detected against Tier 1A/1B SIV isolates, with a moderate level noted against a Tier 2 isolate. Increased serum antibody affinity to SIVmac251 gp140 and generation of Env-specific memory B cells were observed in the immunized macaques. Animals were subjected to low-dose intravaginal challenge with SIVmac251 one week after the last protein boost. One out of three immunized animals was protected from infection. Although performed with a small number of macaques, this study demonstrates the utility of oligomeric envelopes formulated with Advax in eliciting broad antibody responses with the potential to provide protection against SIV transmission.","Menon, Veena; Ayala, Victor I; Rangaswamy, Sneha P; Kalisz, Irene; Whitney, Stephen; Galmin, Lindsey; Ashraf, Asma; LaBranche, Celia; Montefiori, David; Petrovsky, Nikolai; Kalyanaraman, Vaniambadi S; Pal, Ranajit",The Journal of general virology,389,9

It has been proposed that shortening the ASA dosing interval may overcome the time-dependent renewal of the drug target, leading to a greater antiplatelet effect. We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to determine the efficacy of once- versus twice-daily ASA in conditions with increased platelet turnover. METHODS We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis by searching the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase databases for RCTs assessing once- versus twice-daily ASA. Data were screened, extracted, and appraised by two independent reviewers, and were pooled using a random-effects model. The primary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and serum thromboxane B2 (TxB2). Other pharmacodynamic measures were retrieved as secondary outcomes. Results were reported as mean differences with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS Seven RCTs were included, enrolling 379 participants overall. None of the studies reported clinical outcomes. Pooled results showed that compared with once-daily ASA, twice-daily ASA was associated with a decrease in mean TxB2 of 1.42 ng/mL (95% CI - 2.71 to - 0.13; I2 = 66%). We found no differences in subgroup analyses based on disease subtype, trial blinding, or trial design. A greater antiplatelet activity of the twice-daily regimen was also found when using PFA-100-ADP methods, although not when using the VerifyNow, LTA-AA, and multiplate methods. CONCLUSIONS Twice-daily ASA was associated with a greater antiplatelet effect compared with standard once-daily ASA.","Mainoli, Beatrice; Duarte, Gonçalo S; Costa, João; Ferreira, Joaquim; Caldeira, Daniel","American journal of cardiovascular drugs : drugs, devices, and other interventions",389,17

This is particularly relevant in an era of unprecedented uncertainties converging from the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple zoonotic outbreaks for the past two decades, and the climate crisis currently unfolding. Moreover, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services cautioned in 2019 that around one million animal and plant species are threatened with extinction. Human existence and medical innovations are closely intertwined with preservation and sustainability of biodiversity. COVID-19 is a ""dry run"" for future ecological crises in the 21st century. We need new frames and ways of conceptualizing planetary health, biodiversity futures, and their principled governance post-COVID-19. In this article, I propose ""One Nature"" as a critically informed planetary health governance frame, and outline its key conceptual pillars. One Nature aims to transcend the socially constructed binaries between humans versus nature, humans versus nonhuman animals or inanimate objects in nature, among other false binaries, and thus, envisions nature as an overlapping, interdependent, and co-constitutive continuum among life forms and ecosystems. One Nature also recognizes animal sentience and agency of nonhuman animals. In doing so, the One Nature governance frame places a firm emphasis on the internal levers of social change and the human values essential to cultivate collective action to curb unchecked extraction of nature that placed human societies in harm's way for future health crises. One Nature is a governance frame and reflexive value system that can be transformative to correct the astigmatism we have long suffered, from the ways in which we have conceived, enacted on, and extracted the natural systems over the centuries. All in all, One Nature supports planetary health and biodiversity through a new vocabulary and post-anthropocentric critical governance lens, and shall help formulate progressive policies to prevent zoonotic outbreaks and future ecological crises.","Özdemir, Vural",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,389,17

STUDY DESIGN Multi-institutional retrospective case series. ANIMALS Dogs with suspected PRAA (n=9). METHODS Medical records were reviewed from 2012 to 2016. Dogs undergoing thoracoscopy for PRAA at 3 referral hospitals were included. Signalment, clinical signs, diagnostic imaging, anesthesia protocol (including the use of one-lung ventilation), surgical approach, complications, and short-term outcome were recorded. Dogs underwent a left-sided intercostal thoracoscopic approach with concurrent intraoperative esophagoscopy. The ligamentum arteriosum (LA) and constricting fibers were divided using a vessel-sealing device using a 3 or 4 port thoracoscopy technique. Visualization and dissection of the LA was aided by transesophageal illumination by esophagoscopy. RESULTS Thoracoscopy confirmed PRAA in 9 dogs, with an aberrant left subclavian artery (LS) identified in 5 dogs. Major complications occurred in 2 dogs: postoperative hemorrhage from the LS and esophageal perforation, which resulted in euthanasia. Median follow-up was 250 days (range, 56-1,595). Regurgitation resolved in 4 of 8 surviving dogs. One dog had recurrence of regurgitation 1,450 days postoperatively, esophageal compression by the LS was identified, and regurgitation resolved following LS transection. CONCLUSION Esophagoscopy aided identification and dissection of the LA in all cases.

AIM This research examines front-line nurses' reflections on the time of SARS in Hong Kong in order to articulate: (1) the nature and complexity of their experience, and (2) what lessons can be learned for future disease crises. METHODS Personal reflective essays written in 2004 by seven senior nurses studying a part-time Masters in Nursing degree at a Hong Kong university were analysed using a form of content analysis. FINDINGS The nurses' stories report immense personal costs on nurses, on their families and on the wider community. The analysis of the narratives was used to build a model, indicating how nurses' personal lives were 'sandwiched' between, on the one hand, their commitment to families and local community and, on the other hand, their professional commitment to the needs of a health system in crisis. CONCLUSION In dealing with future health crises, it is imperative that a multilevel approach be taken.","Holroyd, E; McNaught, C",International nursing review,389,1

METHODS A 64-year-old man came to our attention because of blurred vision after a 2-month hospital stay for treatment of COVID-19 infection. Examination findings revealed PACG, with severe visual impairment in the right eye and PAC in the left eye due to plateau iris syndrome. The patient's severe clinical condition and prolonged systemic therapy masked the symptoms and delayed the diagnosis. Medical chart review disclosed the multifactorial causes of the visual impairment. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) aided in diagnosis and subsequent therapy. RESULTS The cause behind the primary angle closure and the iridotrabecular contact was eliminated by bilateral cataract extraction, goniosynechialysis, and myotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 treatment may pose an increased risk for PAC. Accurate recording of patient and family ophthalmic history is essential to prevent its onset. Recognition of early signs of PAC is key to averting its progression to PACG.","Barosco, Guido; Morbio, Roberta; Chemello, Francesca; Tosi, Roberto; Marchini, Giorgio",European journal of ophthalmology,389,20

Objective To assess whether helmet noninvasive ventilation can increase the days free of respiratory support in patients with COVID-19 compared with high-flow nasal oxygen alone. Design, Setting, and Participants Multicenter randomized clinical trial in 4 intensive care units (ICUs) in Italy between October and December 2020, end of follow-up February 11, 2021, including 109 patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure (ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ≤200). Interventions Participants were randomly assigned to receive continuous treatment with helmet noninvasive ventilation (positive end-expiratory pressure, 10-12 cm H2O; pressure support, 10-12 cm H2O) for at least 48 hours eventually followed by high-flow nasal oxygen (n = 54) or high-flow oxygen alone (60 L/min) (n = 55). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the number of days free of respiratory support within 28 days after enrollment. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients who required endotracheal intubation within 28 days from study enrollment, the number of days free of invasive mechanical ventilation at day 28, the number of days free of invasive mechanical ventilation at day 60, in-ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, 28-day mortality, 60-day mortality, ICU length of stay, and hospital length of stay. Results Among 110 patients who were randomized, 109 (99%) completed the trial (median age, 65 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 55-70]; 21 women [19%]). The median days free of respiratory support within 28 days after randomization were 20 (IQR, 0-25) in the helmet group and 18 (IQR, 0-22) in the high-flow nasal oxygen group, a difference that was not statistically significant (mean difference, 2 days [95% CI, -2 to 6]; P = .26). Of 9 prespecified secondary outcomes reported, 7 showed no significant difference. The rate of endotracheal intubation was significantly lower in the helmet group than in the high-flow nasal oxygen group (30% vs 51%; difference, -21% [95% CI, -38% to -3%]; P = .03). The median number of days free of invasive mechanical ventilation within 28 days was significantly higher in the helmet group than in the high-flow nasal oxygen group (28 [IQR, 13-28] vs 25 [IQR 4-28]; mean difference, 3 days [95% CI, 0-7]; P = .04). The rate of in-hospital mortality was 24% in the helmet group and 25% in the high-flow nasal oxygen group (absolute difference, -1% [95% CI, -17% to 15%]; P > .99). Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe hypoxemia, treatment with helmet noninvasive ventilation, compared with high-flow nasal oxygen, resulted in no significant difference in the number of days free of respiratory support within 28 days. Further research is warranted to determine effects on other outcomes, including the need for endotracheal intubation.

Immunosuppression, obesity, and use of steroids are known risk factors. The purpose of the retrospective study was to summarize and evaluate experiences and results of laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) hernia repair. METHODS We reviewed our liver transplant patients over a seven-yr period with laparoscopic incisional hernia repair (LIHR) to direct our attention on risk factors for hernia recurrence after hernia repair. RESULTS Fifty-four patients after LT with incisional hernia were treated with laparoscopic repair, 42 male and 12 female patients of overall mean age of 58 ± 9 yr and body mass index (BMI) of 25 ± 4 kg/m(2) . A total of 755 LTs were performed at our institution in this time period, resulting in 7.15% of patients undergoing laparoscopic hernia repair. The mean postoperative hospital stay after was nine d. During the follow-up, nine recurrent hernias were noted (17%). BMI (p = 0.001) and sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy were significantly associated with hernia recurrence (p = 0.014). CONCLUSION LIHR is a safe and feasible method to treat hernias after LT. BMI and sirolimus as immunosuppressive therapy are risk factors for recurrence of hernia after laparoscopic hernia repair.","Weiss, Sascha; Weissenbacher, Annemarie; Sucher, Robert; Denecke, Christian; Brandl, Andreas; Messner, Franka; Oellinger, Robert; Schneeberger, Stefan; Schmid, Thomas; Pratschke, Johann; Biebl, Matthias",Clinical transplantation,389,9

Our aim was to investigate the value of additional chest CT for detection of coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) in patients who undergo head CT for suspected stroke or head trauma in a COVID-19-endemic region. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our study included 27 patients (mean age, 74 years; range, 54-90 years; 20 men) who underwent head CT for suspected stroke (n = 21) or head trauma (n = 6), additional chest CT for COVID-19 detection, and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing in a COVID-19-endemic region. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 were calculated. RESULTS Final neurologic diagnoses were ischemic stroke (n = 11), brain contusion (n = 5), nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage (n = 2), brain metastasis (n = 1), and no primary neurologic disorder (n = 8). Symptoms of possible COVID-19 infection (ie, fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath) were present in 20 of 27 (74%) patients. Seven of 27 patients (26%) had real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed-COVID-19 infection. Chest CT results were 6 true-positives, 15 true-negatives, 5 false-positives, and 1 false-negative. Diagnostic performance values of chest CT were a sensitivity of 85.7%, specificity of 75.0%, negative predictive value of 93.8%, and positive predictive value of 54.6%. CONCLUSIONS The sensitivity of additional chest CT is fairly high. However, a negative result does not exclude COVID-19. The positive predictive value is poor. Correlation of chest CT results with epidemiologic history and clinical presentation, along with real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, is needed for confirmation.","Kwee, R M; Krdzalic, J; Fasen, B A C M; de Jaegere, T M H",AJNR.

Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive technique, which allows a continuous bedside monitoring of flap oxygenation. The current literature is lacking in the assessment of variables able to modify the NIRS monitoring. The aim of this study is to identify patient and flap-related variables that can affect regional oxygen saturation (rSO2). METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the data obtained from 45 consecutive patients undergoing breast reconstruction with deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap. The monitoring device used is the Somanetics INVOS 5100C Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter (Covidien). Baseline measures of demographic-anthropometric variables (age, weight, height, body mass index [BMI]) and flap factors (flap size in grams, skin flap area in square centimeters, perforator number, and perforator size in millimeters) were collected from preoperative and intraoperative assessment. We investigated the linear correlation between mean rSO2 and BMI, flap size, skin flap area, perforator number, and perforator size. RESULTS A positive linear correlation between rSO2 values and skin flap area, perforator number, and perforator size was found. A negative linear correlation between rSO2 values and BMI and flap size was found. All correlations are statistically significant. Despite the overall negative linear correlation between rSO2 values and flap size, we observed a bimodal trend: a positive relation up to 800 g, which is inverted above 800 g. CONCLUSION The NIRS is a reliable additional tool in free flap monitoring. A careful evaluation should be given to patients and surgery factors that can change the oximetry data.","Salgarello, Marzia; Pagliara, Domenico; Rossi, Marco; Visconti, Giuseppe; Barone-Adesi, Liliana",Journal of reconstructive microsurgery,389,11

STUDY DESIGN Randomized prospective study ANIMALS: Healthy, adult, sexually intact female cats (n = 30). METHODS Ten cats were assigned to each group: LAO with BVSD (group A), LAO with ligation (group B), and OO with ligation (group C). Surgical times and complications were assessed. Serum glucose and cortisol were measured prior to surgery and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours after surgery. Pain was scored by using an interactive visual analog scale (IVAS) at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hours after surgery. Rescue analgesia was provided when IVAS score was 4 or more. Physiological and serum values and IVAS scores were compared among groups with area under the curve (AUC) by using a 1-way ANOVA. RESULTS Surgical time was shortest for group C (19.1 ± 5.2 minutes; P < .0002); there was no significant difference between groups A (27.7 ± 6.6 minutes) and B (33.2 ± 8.2 minutes). All procedures were completed successfully. No significant differences among groups were found in IVAS scores (P = .36), rescue analgesia (P = .22), glucose AUC (P = .53), or cortisol AUC (P = .27). CONCLUSION The LAO technique was accomplished as described in all cats with no complications or failures. Pain scores were not different from cats undergoing OO. LAO can be performed efficiently to maximize the benefits of minimally invasive surgery and is amenable to clinical practice.","Sakals, Sherisse A; Rawlings, Clarence A; Laity, Jamie; Hofmeister, Erik H; Radlinsky, MaryAnn G",Veterinary surgery : VS,389,1

As a result, first-order degradation kinetics could be confirmed for all substances. The irradiance had no linear influence on the degradation of the compounds. Hydrogen peroxides were added to the wastewater to be treated, as electron acceptors and boosters, and alone had no great oxidative effect on the parent substances. The combination of photocatalysis with the addition of hydrogen peroxide as an electron acceptor had great synergetic effects which can reduce the required energy of the process through a short retention time.

METHODS Ninety-one patients with 100 complex MCA aneurysms not amenable to simple coiling were treated with stent-assisted embolization as a first option. Technical and clinical results, initial follow-up imaging, and long-term annual MR angiography (MRA) were reviewed. RESULTS Intracranial stents were successfully deployed in all 100 aneurysms. There was 1 case of significant neurological morbidity (1%) and 1 case of death (1%) related to treatment. Initial posttreatment angiography revealed complete occlusion of 48 aneurysms (48%), a residual neck in 21 (21%), and residual aneurysm filling in 31 (31%). Follow-up imaging performed in 85 (90.4%) of a possible 94 aneurysms showed complete occlusion of 77 aneurysms (90.6%), residual neck in 3 (3.5%), and residual filling in 5 (5.9%). Four aneurysms (4.7%) required retreatment. Long-term MRA follow-up revealed stability or progressive thrombosis in 47 (97.9%) of 48 aneurysms. In 11 patients Y-configuration stenting caused only 1 minor complication and provided durable occlusion in all cases. CONCLUSIONS Stent-assisted techniques increase the number of aneurysms that may be treated endovascularly and represent an acceptable alternative to craniotomy.

Bleeding occurred in 457 of 41 537 patients (1.10%), 10 of 668 (1.50%) without prophylaxis, 116 of 12 831 (0.90%) in the aspirin group, 258 of 22 620 (1.14%) with anticoagulation, and 73 of 5418 (1.35%) of those receiving both. Aspirin alone was also noninferior for bleeding complications (adjusted odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.63-1.00, P for inferiority <.001). Conclusions and Relevance In this study of patients undergoing TKA, aspirin was not inferior to other anticoagulants in the postoperative rate of VTE or death. Aspirin alone may provide similar protection from postoperative VTE compared with other anticoagulation treatments.","Hood, Brandon R; Cowen, Mark E; Zheng, Huiyong T; Hughes, Richard E; Singal, Bonita; Hallstrom, Brian R",JAMA surgery,389,23

Methods From May 2016 to December 2017, 78 patients underwent RAPN for renal tumors. Inner suture was performed in the opened collecting system or renal sinus, whereas parenchymal renorrhaphy was not. For hemostasis, the soft coagulation system was used, and absorbable hemostats were placed on the resection bed. CE-CT was carried out within 7 days after surgery. Data on these patients were prospectively collected. A single radiologist determined the diagnosis of RAP. Results Median (range) data were as follows: Patient age, 65 (19-82) years; radiographic tumor size, 30 (12-95) mm; operating time, 166 (102-294) min; warm ischemic time, 16 (7-67) min; and blood loss, 15 (0-4450) mL. One patient (1.6%) required a perioperative blood transfusion. No patient required conversion to open surgery or nephrectomy. CE-CT was carried out at median 6 (3-7) days after surgery. CE-CT showed no RAP development in all 61 patients. Urinary leakage was not observed. One patient had acute cholecystitis, a postoperative complication classified as Clavien-Dindo grade higher than 3, which was treated with cholecystectomy. Positive surgical margin was identified in four patients (6.6%). Conclusion RAPN using soft coagulation and absorbable hemostats without renorrhaphy appears to be feasible and safe. Our technique could eliminate the risk of RAP.","Tohi, Yoichiro; Murata, Shiori; Makita, Noriyuki; Suzuki, Issei; Kubota, Masashi; Sugino, Yoshio; Inoue, Koji; Ueda, Hiroyuki; Kawakita, Mutsushi",Asian journal of urology,389,29

However, it remains unclear whether the day of the week of ECMO initiation affects patient outcomes. We aimed to investigate whether the initiation of ECMO therapy during a weekend was associated with increased mortality risk. Methods We performed a population-level cohort study, based on health records obtained from the National Health Insurance Service database in South Korea. All critically ill adult patients who received ECMO therapy in the intensive care unit during 2005-2018 were enrolled. The primary endpoint was the 60-day mortality rate following ECMO therapy. Multivariable Cox regression was used for the analysis. Results Data from a total of 21,129 ECMO patients were included in the analysis, of whom 12,825 (60.7%) died within 60 days. There were 4,647 (22.0%) patients who received ECMO therapy during a weekend (weekend group). Multivariable Cox regression revealed that the weekend group was at increased risk of 60-day mortality compared to the weekday group (hazard ratio: 1.05, 95% confidence interval: 1.01 to 1.09; P=0.025). In the sensitivity analysis, ECMO patients whose therapy started on a Saturday were at higher risk of 60-day mortality (hazard ratio relative to those whose therapy started on a Wednesday: 1.11, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.19; P=0.003). However, starting ECMO therapy on other weekdays (Thursday, Friday, Sunday, Monday, or Tuesday) did not affect mortality outcomes (P>0.05). Conclusions ECMO therapy initiated during a weekend was associated with a slightly increased risk of 60-day mortality compared to that associated with ECMO therapy initiated on a weekday. This association was more evident in patients who received ECMO therapy that started on a Saturday. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.","Cho, Hyoung-Won; Song, In-Ae; Oh, Tak Kyu",Annals of translational medicine,389,16

This prevention implies an effective system of epidemiological surveillance and the application of timely and effective control measures. This research focuses on the application of techniques for modelling and geovisualization of epidemic data with the aim of simple and fast communication of analytical results via geoportal. Methods The paper describes the approach applied through the project of establishing the epidemiological location-intelligence system for monitoring the effectiveness of control measures in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Results Epidemic data were processed and the results related to spatio-temporal analysis of the infection spread were presented by compartmental epidemic model, reproduction number R, epi-curve diagrams as well as choropleth maps for different levels of administrative units. Geovisualization of epidemic data enabled the release of numerous information from described models and indicators, providing easier visual communication of the spread of the disease and better recognition of its trend. Conclusion The approach involves the simultaneous application of epidemic models and epidemic data geovisualization, which allows a simple and rapid evaluation of the epidemic situation and the effects of control measures. This contributes to more informative decision-making related to control measures by suggesting their selective application at the local level.","Ponjavić, Mirza; Karabegović, Almir; Ferhatbegović, Elvir; Tahirović, Emin; Uzunović, Selma; Travar, Maja; Pilav, Aida; Mulić, Maida; Karakaš, Sead; Avdić, Nermin; Mulabdić, Zarina; Pavić, Goran; Bičo, Medina; Vasilj, Ivan; Mamić, Diana; Hukić, Mirsada","Medicinski glasnik : official publication of the Medical Association of Zenica-Doboj Canton, Bosnia and Herzegovina",389,1

We describe the GI-related patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of patients with anal cancer receiving chemoradiotherapy to improve patient-physician communication. METHODS We prospectively followed patients with nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal who received definitive chemoradiotherapy. Patients completed the bowel subdomain of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire before treatment and at 4 subsequent timepoints. We used the paired Wilcoxon test to compare EPIC scores at different times. RESULTS The study included 21 patients; median age was 57 years. Most patients (52%) had T2 and either N0 or N1 disease (81%). Most patients (91%) received chemotherapy with cisplatin-fluorouracil and either intensity-modulated radiotherapy or volumetric modulated arc therapy. Compared with the patients' median overall summary score at baseline (66), their median score at 1 week (82) was higher (P = .009), whereas their median score at 5 weeks (54) was lower (P = .025). The patients' median overall summary score at baseline and at 3 months did not differ (P = .919). Three months after radiotherapy, most patients reported minimal adverse effects compared with baseline. CONCLUSION The GI-related PROs of patients with anal cancer tend to fluctuate during radiotherapy but return to baseline by 3 months, at which time most patients report few or no residual adverse effects. We provide a clear timeline of GI acute toxicity using sequential PRO measurements that will improve patient-physician communication regarding expectations for cancer treatment.","Kouzy, Ramez; Abi Jaoude, Joseph; Lin, Daniel; El Alam, Molly B; Minsky, Bruce D; Koay, Eugene J; Das, Prajnan; Holliday, Emma B; Klopp, Ann H; Colbert, Lauren E; Taniguchi, Cullen M",JCO oncology practice,389,16

The use of a disposable balloon dissector increases the cost of TEP. However, it remains unclear whether BD saves enough time to justify its cost. We hypothesized that BD would consistently save 15 min in operative time. To test this hypothesis, we designed a registry-based randomized controlled trial (RB-RCT) embedded into the Americas Hernia Society Quality Collaborative. METHODS A single-blinded, parallel, RB-RCT was conducted. Adults with inguinal hernias presenting for elective repair were screened. Patients with unilateral hernias deemed fit to undergo TEP were eligible; those with bilateral hernias (BIH) or undergoing open repair were excluded. Individuals were randomized to TD or BD with a disposable device. TEP was performed with synthetic mesh and tacks. Subjects were blinded and followed up for 30 day. Main outcome was operative time. RESULTS 207 patients were screened: 166 were excluded and 41 were randomized (21 BD, 20 TD). One patient (TD group) was excluded due to the incidental finding of BIH. 40 patients were analyzed (median age 56, median BMI 26 kg/m2, 98% males). Hernias were 72% indirect, 17% direct, 10% pantaloon, and 8% recurrent. Other than obesity (26.5% vs. 0, p = 0.018), there were no baseline differences between the groups. Median operative times were similar (TD 43 min, IQR 33-63; BD 46 min, IQR 35-90, p = 0.490). There were 2 seromas and 2 hematomas in the BD group, and none in the TD (p = 0.108). CONCLUSIONS BD does not consistently result in 15-min time saving during TEP. Use of a disposable balloon dissector can be deferred in the experienced hands.

Furthermore, characterizing drug development risk, the probability that a drug will eventually receive regulatory approval, has been notoriously hard given the complexities of drug biology and clinical trials. This inherent risk is often misunderstood and mischaracterized, leading to inefficient allocation of resources and, as a result, an overall reduction in R&D productivity.

Sodium fluoride existing in the vacutainer tubes was used to inhibit esterase activity to protect the clevidipine from hydrolysis as soon as blood was collected. Ascorbic acid and formic acid were added to the separated plasma samples to avoid the oxidation and further hydrolysis of clevidipine and H152/81. The further sample preparation was accomplished through a single step liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) by ethyl acetate. The chromatography separation was carried out on an ACE Excel 3 μm SuperC18 (2.1 × 50 mm, id, ACE, United Kingdom) column with gradient elution using 10 mM ammonium acetate water solution and methanol as the mobile phase. Detection was performed in the negative ion electrospray ionization mode using multiple reaction monitoring (clevidipine: m/z 454.1 → 234.0; clevidipine-d7: m/z 461.1 → 240.1; H152/81: m/z 354.0 → 208.0; H152/81-13CD3: m/z 358.0 → 212.0). The method exhibited good linearity over the concentration ranges of 0.100 to 40.0 ng/mL for clevidipine and 5.00 to 400 ng/mL for H152/81. The intra- and inter-batch precision and accuracy of clevidipine and H152/81 were all within the acceptable criteria. The method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of clevidipine and H152/81 in healthy Chinese volunteers following 8 mg/h intravenous infusion of clevidipine butyrate injectable emulsion for 0.5 h. The results showed that clevidipine was rapidly eliminated with a short half-life time of 0.244 ± 0.125 h and a maximum concentration of 25.2 ± 7.09 ng/mL. H152/81 was detectable in the plasma samples up to 48.5 h with a half-life time of 10.7 ± 2.30 h and a maximum plasma concentration of 301 ± 38.1 ng/mL.","Zhang, Yujia; Zhao, Shunbo; Zhou, Huan; Ding, Li","Journal of chromatography.

DESIGN First, an intelligibility assessment of the target narratives was conducted to establish a signal-to-noise ratio ensuring accurate initial speech recognition. Then, narrative comprehension for two target types (fixed and varied target talker) was measured in four listening conditions (quiet, one-talker speech, speech babble, speech-shaped noise). After hearing target narratives in each listening condition, participants completed a visual recognition memory task that assessed the comprehension of the narrative materials at three levels of representation (surface form, propositional, event model). STUDY SAMPLE Seventy adults (18-32 years of age). RESULTS Narrative comprehension results revealed a main effect of listening condition at the event model level, indicating poorer narrative memory of described situations for all noise conditions compared to quiet. Increased positive responses to thematically consistent but situationally ""wrong"" memory probes drove this effect. No other significant effects were observed. CONCLUSION Despite near-perfect speech recognition, background noise negatively influenced aspects of spoken narrative comprehension and memory. Specifically, noise did not disrupt memory for what was said (surface form and propositional memory), but only memory for what was talked about (event model memory).","Wasiuk, Peter A; Radvansky, Gabriel A; Greene, Robert L; Calandruccio, Lauren",International journal of audiology,389,23

Although SARS-CoV-2 is visualized on electron microscopy, there is an increasing demand for widely applicable techniques to visualize viral components within tissue specimens. Viral protein and RNA can be detected on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH), respectively. Herein, we evaluate the staining performance of ISH for SARS-CoV-2 and an IHC directed at the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein and compare these results to a gold standard, tissue quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). We evaluated FFPE sections from 8 COVID-19 autopsies, including 19 pulmonary and 39 extrapulmonary samples including the heart, liver, kidney, small intestine, skin, adipose tissue, and bone marrow. We performed RNA-ISH for SARS-CoV-2 on all cases with IHC for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR performed on selected cases. Lungs from 37 autopsies performed before the COVID-19 pandemic served as negative controls. The ISH and IHC slides were reviewed by 4 observers to record a consensus opinion. Selected ISH and IHC slides were also reviewed by 4 independent observers. Evidence of SARS-CoV-2 was identified on both the IHC and ISH platforms. Within the postmortem lung, detected viral protein and RNA were often extracellular, predominantly within hyaline membranes in patients with diffuse alveolar damage. Among individual cases, there was regional variation in the amount of detectable virus in lung samples. Intracellular viral RNA and protein was localized to pneumocytes and immune cells. Viral RNA was detected on RNA-ISH in 13 of 19 (68%) pulmonary FFPE blocks from patients with COVID-19. Viral protein was detected on IHC in 8 of 9 (88%) pulmonary FFPE blocks from patients with COVID-19, although in 5 cases the stain was interpreted as equivocal. From the control cohort, FFPE blocks from all 37 patients were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA-ISH, whereas 5 of 13 cases were positive on IHC. Collectively, when compared with qRT-PCR on individual tissue blocks, the sensitivity and specificity for ISH was 86.7% and 100%, respectively, while those for IHC were 85.7% and 53.3%, respectively. The interobserver variability for ISH ranged from moderate to almost perfect, whereas that for IHC ranged from slight to moderate. All extrapulmonary samples from COVID-19-positive cases were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by ISH, IHC, and qRT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2 is detectable on both RNA-ISH and nucleocapsid IHC. In the lung, viral RNA and nucleocapsid protein is predominantly extracellular and within hyaline membranes in some cases, while intracellular locations are more prominent in others. The intracellular virus is detected within pneumocytes, bronchial epithelial cells, and possibly immune cells. The ISH platform is more specific, easier to analyze and the interpretation is associated with the improved interobserver agreement. ISH, IHC, and qRT-PCR failed to detect the virus in the heart, liver, and kidney.","Massoth, Lucas R; Desai, Niyati; Szabolcs, Annamaria; Harris, Cynthia K; Neyaz, Azfar; Crotty, Rory; Chebib, Ivan; Rivera, Miguel N; Sholl, Lynette M; Stone, James R; Ting, David T; Deshpande, Vikram",The American journal of surgical pathology,389,4

Accordingly, a full-coverage high-resolution air pollutant data set with timely updates and historical long-term records is essential to support both research and environmental management. Here, for the first time, we develop a near real-time air pollutant database known as Tracking Air Pollution in China (TAP, http://tapdata.org.cn/) that combines information from multiple data sources, including ground observations, satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD), operational chemical transport model simulations, and other ancillary data such as meteorological fields, land use data, population, and elevation. Daily full-coverage PM2.5 data at a spatial resolution of 10 km is our first near real-time product. The TAP PM2.5 is estimated based on a two-stage machine learning model coupled with the synthetic minority oversampling technique and a tree-based gap-filling method. Our model has an averaged out-of-bag cross-validation R2 of 0.83 for different years, which is comparable to those of other studies, but improves its performance at high pollution levels and fills the gaps in missing AOD on daily scale. The full coverage and near real-time updates of the daily PM2.5 data allow us to track the day-to-day variations in PM2.5 concentrations over China in a timely manner. The long-term records of PM2.5 data since 2000 will also support policy assessments and health impact studies.

The purpose of this study was to investigate infections caused by hMPV in two groups of patients admitted to hospital: Immunocompromized patients with a potential risk of severe outcomes and immunocompetent patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. A total of 288 samples were tested: 165 samples were collected from patients with suspected influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 infection during the first pandemic wave in 2009; and 123 samples were collected from patients of a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation program in 2008-2009. Amplification of the hMPV genes was performed by polymerase chain reaction. This was followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. hMPV was detected in 14.2% (41/288) of all samples: 17% (28/165) of immunocompetent patients with suspected H1N1 infection and 10.6% (13/123) among hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. hMPV accounted for 12.1% (8/66) of immunocompetent adults patients with severe respiratory infections (median age, 55.9 years). Two hMPV subtypes were identified, A2 (26.9%; 7/26) and B2 (73.1%; 19/26) but no difference was observed between the patient groups in terms of age or immunosuppression level.

Flax textiles uniquely combine hydrophilicity and strength, with the technical know-how to produce precisely engineered two- and three-dimensional knitted or woven structures. It is, however, extremely difficult to completely remove endotoxins from the flax, and this essentially precludes the use of linen for implant purposes. Herein, the potential utility of flax textiles for blood-contacting applications is investigated, using purified two-dimensional mesh specimens, with and without an albumin surface coating. It was hypothesized that the albumin coating will abolish the effect of adherent endotoxins at the flax's surface. In vitro cell viability assays showed that the flax mesh ± albumin is not cytotoxic. The albumin coating reduced (but not abolished) the effect of surface-exposed endotoxins (Limulus amebocyte lysate test). Under dynamic conditions, the albumin coating favors coverage with endothelial cells. Experiments with fresh human blood plasma (platelet-rich and platelet-free) showed that the albumin coating reduces the thrombogenicity in vitro. Platelets adhered to the albumin-coated flax mesh showed a less flattened structure. Although the results of this work cannot be extrapolated easily to in vivo situations, the data reveal that woven or knitted tubular structures produced from flax fibers may hold promise as implantable blood contacting devices like for instance vascular grafts.","Michel, Sophie A A X; Knetsch, Menno L W; Koole, Leo H",Journal of biomaterials science.

We surveyed neurosurgical residents applying for subspecialty fellowships about their experiences to evaluate the process and find areas for improvement. METHODS We distributed an online, nationwide survey to 153 U.S. neurosurgical residents (postgraduate years 5-7) identified via the American Association of Neurological Surgeons resident database. RESULTS Sixty-nine residents responded to the survey representing a variety of subspecialties. Most residents applied for 2-5 programs (45%) and completed 2-5 interviews (45%). The primary methods of finding fellowships were via word of mouth (68%) and faculty mentors (67%), followed by websites and reaching out to fellowship directors (54%) and online database searching (46%). Although many residents applied for fellowships in postgraduate year 5 of training (39%), there was significant variability in times for interviews and offer letters. Most residents accepted their first offer (75%). Most respondents (93%) thought that national neurosurgical societies should help improve the fellowship application process with reasons including a common application and due dates (29%), fellowship database with program details (29%), and improved coordination of interviews (23%). In regards to a nationalized match system, residents were roughly split among opposed (38.6%), neutral (26.3%), and supportive (35.1%).

The closure or reduction of community services people rely on after release such as treatment centres and shelters has exacerbated the risks of poor health outcomes and harms. This paper aims to learn from peer health mentors (PHM) about changes to their work during overlapping health emergencies, as well as barriers and opportunities to support people leaving prison in this context. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH The Unlocking the Gates (UTG) Peer Health Mentoring Program supports people leaving prison in British Columbia during the first three days after release. The authors conducted two focus groups with PHM over video conference in May 2020. Focus groups were recorded and transcribed, and themes were iteratively developed using narrative thematic analysis. FINDINGS The findings highlighted the importance of peer health mentorship for people leaving prisons. PHM discussed increased opportunities for collaboration, ways the pandemic has changed how they are able to provide support, and how PHM are able to remain responsive and flexible to meet client needs. Additionally, PHM illuminated ways that COVID-19 has exacerbated existing barriers and identified specific actions needed to support client health, including increased housing and recovery beds, and tools for social and emotional well-being. ORIGINALITY/VALUE This study contributes to our understanding of peer health mentorship during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of mentors. PHM expertise can support release planning, improved health and well-being of people leaving prison and facilitate policy-supported pandemic responses.","McLeod, Katherine E; Timler, Kelsey; Korchinski, Mo; Young, Pamela; Milkovich, Tammy; McBride, Cheri; Young, Glenn; Wardell, William; Condello, Lara-Lisa; Buxton, Jane A; Janssen, Patricia A; Martin, Ruth Elwood",International journal of prisoner health,389,28

Here, an independent prospective validation of these results was performed using an overlap-fraction (OF) calculation of various FDG-uptake based thresholds. Data from twelve patients treated at Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center with lung cancer were analyzed. All patients underwent two FDG-PET-CT scans, one pre-radiotherapy (pre-RT) and one approximately three months after treatment (post-RT). Of the twelve analyzed patients, eight patients showed residual FDG uptake on the post-RT scan and were included for analysis. One of these patients had a residue that was not clearly distinguishable from the surrounding tissue due to FDG avid inflammation. Therefore, seven patients remained for further analysis. The mean volume of the residual metabolic-active areas post-RT was 14.6±10.0% (mean±SD) of the mean volume of the gross tumour volume (GTV) pre-RT. The residual metabolic-active areas largely corresponded with the pre-RT GTV (OF=93.7±7.2%). The pre-RT-scan threshold delineations of 34%, 40% and 50% of the SUV(max) had a large OF with the residual region, 86.9±8.3%, 77.4±8.1% and 67.9±6.8%, respectively. In this independent dataset, we confirmed that the location of residual FDG-uptake areas after radiotherapy corresponds with the high FDG-uptake areas pre-radiotherapy. Therefore, a pre-radiotherapy FDG-PET-CT scan can potentially be used for radiotherapy dose redistribution.","Aerts, Hugo J W L; Bussink, Johan; Oyen, Wim J G; van Elmpt, Wouter; Folgering, Annemieke M; Emans, Daisy; Velders, Marije; Lambin, Philippe; De Ruysscher, Dirk",Lung cancer,389,1

BACKGROUND The most appropriate method of mesh fixation is uncertain. METHODS Between June 2007 and June 2011, consecutive patients with primary reducible unilateral inguinal hernia who underwent day-case laparoscopic TEP were recruited. Outcome parameters included the incidence of acute and chronic pain, recurrence rates, morbidity rates, analgesic requirements, quality-of-life (QOL) scores, and direct cost. RESULTS During the study period, 130 patients were included in the study. Patients in the MS group had significantly worse pain scores on the day after operation (P = 0.006). Analgesic requirements were similar between the 2 groups (P = 0.558). At 6 months, no significant differences in the incidence of chronic pain were observed (at rest, after coughing or cycling). The incidence of seroma formation was similar between the 2 groups (P = 0.64), and no recurrences were observed at 1 year. No differences in the QOL scores were detected. The direct cost of the entire hospitalization in the FS group was less expensive (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS FS and MS are both effective methods of providing mesh fixation. FS was associated with reduced acute pain but not chronic pain. The rates of seroma formation were similar. However, the use of FS for mesh fixation was less expensive.

METHODS Cases were defined by the presence of new signs or symptoms that included (1) a single oral temperature ≥ 37.8°C (100.0°F) and (2) the presence of at least 2 of the following symptoms: cough, dyspnea, rhinorrhea, hoarseness, congestion, fatigue, and malaise. Attempted infection-control measures included cohorting patients and staff, empiric isolation precautions, and cessation of group activities. Available nasopharyngeal swab specimens were sent to the Tennessee Department of Health for identification by rT-PCR testing. RESULTS We identified 30 of the 41 (73%) residents as cases over this 16-day outbreak. Due to high numbers of sick personnel, we were unable to cohort staff to 1 unit.

METHOD This is a cross-sectional survey. A total of 2411 ICU doctors and nurses in mainland China were included. Demographic and psychological data were collected via questionnaire. The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was used to evaluate burnout. Differences among regions and departments were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression was applied to determine the associated factors. RESULTS Among the participants, 1122 (46.54%) were doctors, and 1289 (53.46%) were nurses. A total of 800 doctors (71.3% of all doctors) and 881 nurses (68.3% of all nurses) were deemed to be burnout. People working in the general ICU were most likely to be burnout. Factors associated with burnout included having low frequency of exercise, having comorbidities, working in a high-quality hospital, having more years of work experience, having more night shifts and having fewer paid vacation days. CONCLUSIONS The burnout rate of ICU doctors and nurses in mainland China is 69.7%.

Lack of local clinical pharmacology and pharmacometrics expertise, limited training opportunities, and lack of local genomic data may contribute to health inequalities and limit the application of precision medicine. Continuing to develop health care infrastructure, including well designed clinical pharmacology training and data collection in LMICs, can help address these challenges. International collaboration aimed at improving training and infrastructure and encouraging locally driven research and clinical trials will be of benefit. This review describes several examples where clinical pharmacology expertise could be leveraged, including opportunities for pharmacogenomics expertise that could drive improved recommendations for clinical guidelines. Also described are clinical pharmacology and pharmacometrics training programs in Africa, and the personal experience of a Tanzanian researcher currently on a training sabbatical in the United States, as illustrative examples of how training in clinical pharmacology can be effectively implemented in LMICs.

Biolubrication gets impaired due to diseases such as osteoarthritis, in which cartilage damage results from alterations in synovial fluid and lamina splendens composition. Osteoarthritis is treated with hyaluronic acid (HA) orally or via intra-articular injection, but due to the poor adsorption of HA on the cartilage surface in the absence of adhesive molecules, pain relief is temporary. Here, we describe how natural lubrication on degraded cartilage surface can be restored with the help of a bioinspired mucoadhesive biopolymer chitosan catechol (Chi-C). Quartz crystal microbalance was used to mimic the formation of lamina splendens in vitro, known as synovial fluid conditioning films (SyCF), and colloidal probe atomic force microscopy was used to measure their nanoscale frictional properties. Clear evidence of glycoprotein (PRG4) recruitment by Chi-C increased the softness of SyCF, which also improved nanoscale lubrication in vitro, decreasing the friction coefficient from 0.06 to 0.03. At the macroscale, cartilage damage induced by Chondroitinase ABC increased the coefficient of friction (COF) from 0.07 ± 0.04 (healthy tissue) to 0.15 ± 0.03 (after tissue damage) in the presence of synovial fluid after sliding for 50 min. After Chi-C treatment of damaged cartilage, the COF fell to 0.06 ± 0.03, which is comparable to healthy cartilage. Chi-C did not adversely affect the metabolic activity of human chondrocytes. This study provides new key insight into the potential for restoring biolubrication through the use of muco-adhesive molecules.","Wan, Hongping; Ren, Ke; Kaper, Hans J; Sharma, Prashant K","Colloids and surfaces.

Objective To identify evidence and narrative-based practices that promote clinician presence, a state of awareness, focus, and attention with the intent to understand patients. Evidence Review Preliminary practices were derived through a systematic literature review (from January 1997 to August 2017, with a subsequent bridge search to September 2019) of effective interpersonal interventions; observations of primary care encounters in 3 diverse clinics (n = 27 encounters); and qualitative interviews with physicians (n = 10), patients (n = 27), and nonmedical professionals whose occupations involve intense interpersonal interactions (eg, firefighter, chaplain, social worker; n = 30). After evidence synthesis, promising practices were reviewed in a 3-round modified Delphi process by a panel of 14 researchers, clinicians, patients, caregivers, and health system leaders. Panelists rated each practice using 9-point Likert scales (-4 to +4) that reflected the potential effect on patient and clinician experience and feasibility of implementation; after the third round, panelists selected their ""top 5"" practices from among those with median ratings of at least +2 for all 3 criteria. Final recommendations incorporate elements from all highly rated practices and emphasize the practices with the greatest number of panelist votes. Findings The systematic literature review (n = 73 studies) and qualitative research activities yielded 31 preliminary practices. Following evidence synthesis, 13 distinct practices were reviewed by the Delphi panel, 8 of which met criteria for inclusion and were combined into a final set of 5 recommendations: (1) prepare with intention (take a moment to prepare and focus before greeting a patient); (2) listen intently and completely (sit down, lean forward, avoid interruptions); (3) agree on what matters most (find out what the patient cares about and incorporate these priorities into the visit agenda); (4) connect with the patient's story (consider life circumstances that influence the patient's health; acknowledge positive efforts; celebrate successes); and (5) explore emotional cues (notice, name, and validate the patient's emotions). Conclusions and Relevance This mixed-methods study identified 5 practices that have the potential to enhance physician presence and meaningful connection with patients in the clinical encounter.

The impacts of income shocks on mental health may differ across U.S. states during the pandemic, as states have different policy contexts that likely influence mental health. The present study uses survey data from the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey (April-July 2020) to examine whether mental health outcomes vary across U.S. states and to what extent specific state-level contexts moderate the associations between household income shocks and depression (n = 582,440) and anxiety (n = 582,796). We find that the prevalence of depression and anxiety differs across states by household income shock status. For individuals, living in a state with supportive social policies - primarily those related to Medicaid, unemployment insurance, and suspended utility shut offs during the pandemic - weakens the association between household income shocks and mental health. Findings suggest that the lack of a strong federal response to the pandemic alongside the devolution of federal power to states over the past 40 years contributes to inequalities in mental health across states.

AIM LA and OA techniques have been compared in terms of different conditions such as operation time and complication rate. Here, we compared how oxidative DNA damage and some cytokines levels change in relation to LA and OA. METHOD This study was performed in children diagnosed with acute appendicitis in our hospital. The study was conducted on 30 children with acute appendicitis in each group. Oxidative DNA damage and malondialdehyde levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, and interleukin-1β, interleukin-37, ischaemia-modified albumin and total thiol levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. RESULTS There was a dramatic decrease in ischaemia-modified albumin (IMA) levels after LA. However, there were no statistically significant differences in pre- and postoperative IMA levels in the OA group. Oxidative DNA damage and malondialdehyde levels were low significantly according to preoperative levels after the LA and OA. Total thiol levels were high in children who underwent LA while they were low after OA. In addition, postoperative interleukin-1β levels were low in both groups. Furthermore, IL-37 levels postoperatively were low in the LA group, while there was no significant change in the OA group. CONCLUSION LA had a more positive effect on oxidative DNA damage, IL-1β and IL-37 than the OA.

Investigating the case reports of acute stroke in COVID-19 patients, published since the beginning of the pandemic, we tried to trace the pathogenic mechanisms of stroke during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We conducted a systematic review analyzing demographic data, cerebrovascular risk factors, NIHSS score, vascular territory involvement and laboratory findings of 168 patients described in 89 studies, from a pool of 1243 records. Based on our results, we have identified different stroke profiles: (1) cerebral large vessel disease (CLVD) profile with a low disability, simultaneous onset of COVID-19 and stroke symptoms, good outcome and low serum levels of D-dimer and CRP; (2) intracranial bleeding (IB) profile with high disability, poor outcome and low levels of serum markers of inflammation and coagulopathy; (3) CLVD profile with a short time-lapse between COVID-19 symptoms and stroke onset, high neurological disability and very high systemic inflammatory markers; (4) multiple thrombo-embolic disease (MTED) profile with older patients, many comorbidities, disabling stroke, poor outcome, evident alteration of coagulation tests and high serum levels of both D-dimer and CRP. We therefore summarized these different profiles in a spectrum similar to that of visible light, where the violet-blue band included IB and CSVD with low inflammation and prothrombotic activity, the green-yellow band included CLVD with high inflammation and moderate prothrombotic activity and the orange-red band for MTED with moderate-high levels of inflammation and very high prothrombotic activity.","Frisullo, Giovanni; Scala, Irene; Bellavia, Simone; Broccolini, Aldobrando; Brunetti, Valerio; Morosetti, Roberta; Della Marca, Giacomo; Calabresi, Paolo",Reviews in the neurosciences,389,1

Transition to adulthood is an especially important developmental period, as it sets up trajectories of adult functioning. This systematic review summarizes patterns of service use and transition outcomes according to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic characteristics over the transition to adulthood. RECENT FINDINGS Forty studies were included. Low-income and racial/ethnic minority youth on the autism spectrum were less likely to participate in transition planning meetings, enroll in postsecondary education, find competitive employment after high school, live independently, participate in social activities, and receive health care transition services than their White and higher income peers on the autism spectrum.

METHODS An international multidisciplinary (neurosurgery, neuroradiology, neurology, clinical epidemiology) group of 69 specialists was convened to develop and validate the UIATS model using a Delphi consensus. For internal (39 panel members involved in identification of relevant features) and external validation (30 independent external reviewers), 30 selected UIA cases were used to analyze agreement with UIATS management recommendations based on a 5-point Likert scale (5 indicating strong agreement). Interrater agreement (IRA) was assessed with standardized coefficients of dispersion (vr*) (vr* = 0 indicating excellent agreement and vr* = 1 indicating poor agreement). RESULTS The UIATS accounts for 29 key factors in UIA management. Agreement with UIATS (mean Likert scores) was 4.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.1-4.3) per reviewer for both reviewer cohorts; agreement per case was 4.3 (95% CI 4.1-4.4) for panel members and 4.5 (95% CI 4.3-4.6) for external reviewers (p = 0.017). Mean Likert scores were 4.2 (95% CI 4.1-4.3) for interventional reviewers (n = 56) and 4.1 (95% CI 3.9-4.4) for noninterventional reviewers (n = 12) (p = 0.290). Overall IRA (vr*) for both cohorts was 0.026 (95% CI 0.019-0.033). CONCLUSIONS This novel UIA decision guidance study captures an excellent consensus among highly informed individuals on UIA management, irrespective of their underlying specialty. Clinicians can use the UIATS as a comprehensive mechanism for indicating how a large group of specialists might manage an individual patient with a UIA.","Etminan, Nima; Brown, Robert D; Beseoglu, Kerim; Juvela, Seppo; Raymond, Jean; Morita, Akio; Torner, James C; Derdeyn, Colin P; Raabe, Andreas; Mocco, J; Korja, Miikka; Abdulazim, Amr; Amin-Hanjani, Sepideh; Al-Shahi Salman, Rustam; Barrow, Daniel L; Bederson, Joshua; Bonafe, Alain; Dumont, Aaron S; Fiorella, David J; Gruber, Andreas; Hankey, Graeme J; Hasan, David M; Hoh, Brian L; Jabbour, Pascal; Kasuya, Hidetoshi; Kelly, Michael E; Kirkpatrick, Peter J; Knuckey, Neville; Koivisto, Timo; Krings, Timo; Lawton, Michael T; Marotta, Thomas R; Mayer, Stephan A; Mee, Edward; Pereira, Vitor Mendes; Molyneux, Andrew; Morgan, Michael K; Mori, Kentaro; Murayama, Yuichi; Nagahiro, Shinji; Nakayama, Naoki; Niemelä, Mika; Ogilvy, Christopher S; Pierot, Laurent; Rabinstein, Alejandro A; Roos, Yvo B W E M; Rinne, Jaakko; Rosenwasser, Robert H; Ronkainen, Antti; Schaller, Karl; Seifert, Volker; Solomon, Robert A; Spears, Julian; Steiger, Hans-Jakob; Vergouwen, Mervyn D I; Wanke, Isabel; Wermer, Marieke J H; Wong, George K C; Wong, John H; Zipfel, Gregory J; Connolly, E Sander; Steinmetz, Helmuth; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Pasqualin, Alberto; Rüfenacht, Daniel; Vajkoczy, Peter; McDougall, Cameron; Hänggi, Daniel; LeRoux, Peter; Rinkel, Gabriel J E; Macdonald, R Loch",Neurology,389,1

As outbreaks have spread throughout prisons and detention centers, detainees have organized collectively to demand life-saving measures. Chief among these demands has been the call for decarceration: the release of detainees and inmates to prevent exposure to COVID-19. This paper theorizes the compounding racial vulnerability that has led to such a marked spread behind bars, mainly among race-class subjugated communities. METHODS We use journalistic sources and administrative data to provide an in-depth account of the spread of COVID-19 in American correctional facilities and of the mobilization to reduce contagions. We also use two survey experiments to describe public support for harm reduction and decarceration demands and measure the effects of information about (a) racial inequalities in prison, and (b) poor conditions inside migrant detention centers. FINDINGS We find that only one-third to one-half of respondents believe that response to COVID-19 in prisons and immigrant detention centers should be a high priority. We also find that Americans are much more supportive of harm reduction measures like improved sanitation than of releasing people from prisons and detention centers. Information about racial disparities increases support for releasing more people from prison. We do not find any significant effect of information about poor conditions in migrant detention centers. CONCLUSIONS The conditions in prisons and migrant detention centers during the pandemic-and public opinion about them-highlight the realities of compounding racialized vulnerability in the United States.","Denney, Matthew G T; Garibaldo Valdez, Ramon","Journal of health politics, policy and law",389,1

The utility of perfusion imaging for diagnosing VST is not well understood. SUMMARY We retrospectively reviewed cases of acute VST in patients who underwent whole-brain (320-detector-row) computed tomographic (CT) perfusion imaging in combination with craniocervical CT venography. Perfusion maps that were analyzed included cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral blood flow (CBF), mean transit time, and time to peak. Among the 10 patients with acute VST included in this study, 9 had perfusion abnormalities. All perfusion abnormalities were localized in areas adjacent to the occluded sinus and did not match typical anterior or posterior circulation arterial territories. Bilateral perfusion deficits were seen in 4 cases. In 2 cases, parenchymal hemorrhage was diagnosed on noncontrast CT imaging; in those cases, focal CBV and CBF were reduced. KEY MESSAGES Whole-brain CT perfusion imaging with 320-detector-row scanners can further assist in establishing the diagnosis of VST by detecting perfusion abnormalities corresponding to venous and not arterial territories. CT perfusion could assist in the differentiation between focal reversible changes, such as those caused by vasogenic edema, and irreversible changes due to infarction.","Mokin, Maxim; Ciambella, Chelsey C; Masud, Muhammad W; Levy, Elad I; Snyder, Kenneth V; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Interventional neurology,389,1

METHODS We retrospectively collected clinical and imaging data from 262 cases of confirmed viral pneumonia in 20 hospitals in Yunnan Province, China, from March 1, 2015 to March 15, 2020. According to the virus responsible for the pneumonia, the pneumonias were divided into non-COVID-19 (141 cases) and COVID-19 (121 cases). The non-COVID-19 pneumonias comprised cytomegalovirus (CMV) (31 cases), influenza A virus (82 cases), and influenza B virus (20 cases). The differences in the basic clinical characteristics, lesion distribution, location and imaging signs among the four viral pneumonias were analyzed and compared. RESULTS Fever and cough were the most common clinical symptoms of the four viral pneumonias. Compared with the COVID-19 patients, the non-COVID-19 patients had higher proportions of fatigue, sore throat, expectorant and chest tightness (all P<0.000). In addition, in the CMV pneumonia patients, the proportions of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and leukopenia were high (all PP<0.000). Comparison of the imaging findings of the four viral pneumonias showed that the pulmonary lesions of COVID-19 were more likely to occur in the peripheral and lower lobes of both lungs, whereas those of CMV pneumonia were diffusely distributed. Compared with the non-COVID-19 pneumonias, COVID-19 pneumonia was more likely to present as ground-glass opacity, intralobular interstitial thickening, vascular thickening and halo sign (all PP<0.05). In addition, in the early stage of COVID-19, extensive consolidation, fibrous stripes, subpleural lines, crazy-paving pattern, tree-in-bud, mediastinal lymphadenectasis, pleural thickening and pleural effusion were rare (all PP<0.05).

Organizations, therefore, invest in approaches to improve the likelihood of positive patient responses. Evidence suggests that nurse communication as measured by HCAHPS influences overall patient satisfaction, yet little is known regarding what patients believe constitutes effective communication with nurses. In this qualitative descriptive study, we conducted phone interviews with 49 recently hospitalized patients to better understand patients' perceptions of their communication with nurses. Our findings indicate that patients perceived their communication with nurses to unfold via nurses' behaviors. Namely, nurses' engagement with patients, anticipation of patients' needs, responsiveness to patients' concerns, and teaching practices positively influence patient satisfaction with communication with nurses. These behaviors resonated most strongly with patients during particularly memorable moments of uncertainty and vulnerability over the course of a hospital stay. These findings suggest that focusing on the development of nurses' behaviors, ensuring processes are in place to support positive behaviors and creating organizational environments that position nurses to consistently apply these behaviors, can improve patients' perceptions of their communication with nurses. These findings also provide a foundation for further research focused on developing and testing specific behavioral interventions and their effect on communication perception.","Trotta, Rebecca L; Rao, Aditi D; McHugh, Matthew D; Yoho, Margaret; Cunningham, Regina S",Research in nursing & health,389,2

The purpose of this paper is to determine the effectiveness of self-management on adherence to self-care and management of health status elderly people living with hypertension in Pekanbaru City. Design and methods: This study design was quasi-experimental with a pre-post test with a control group. The self-management intervention was provided through four home visits to elderly people living with hypertension with a caregiver. Samples were taken by the consecutive sampling technique, and a total number 134 elderly people were participants. The instruments used were the adherence to self-care questionnaire and the Short Form 12 Health Survey (SF12) for elderly people. RESULTS The results showed that most of the respondents with hypertension were 60-74 years of age (84.3%), were female (67.9%), of Minang ethnicity (48.5%), had completed primary school (44%), were unemployed (81.3) %), had a family history of hypertension (50%), were non-smokers (52.2%), and had never drunk alcohol (95.5%).

In addition, case managers have been on the front lines of the response across the health care spectrum to reduce risks of contagion, including among health care workers. The purpose of this article is to discuss the case management response, highlighting the importance of individual care plans to provide access to the right care and treatment at the right time to address both the consequences of the disease and patient comorbidities. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTINGS The COVID-19 response spans the full continuum of health and human services, including acute care, subacute care, workers' compensation (especially catastrophic case management), home health, primary care, and community-based care. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE From the earliest days of the pandemic, case managers have assumed an important role on the front lines of the medical response to COVID-19, ensuring that procedures are in place for managing a range of patients: those who were symptomatic but able to self-isolate and care for themselves at home; those who had serious symptoms and needed to be hospitalized; and those who were asymptomatic and needed to be educated about the importance of self-isolating. Across the care spectrum, individualized responses to the clinical and psychosocial needs of patients with COVID-19 in acute care, subacute care, home health, and other outpatient settings have been guided by the well-established case management process of screening, assessing, planning, implementing, following up, transitioning, and evaluating. In addition, professional case managers are guided by values such as advocacy, ensuring access to the right care and treatment at the right time; autonomy, respecting the right to self-determination; and justice, promoting fairness and equity in access to resources and treatment. The value of justice also addresses the sobering reality that people from racial and ethnic minority groups are at an increased risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19. Going forward, case management will continue to play a major role in supporting patients with COVID-19, in both inpatient and outpatient settings, with telephonic follow-up and greater use of telehealth.","Baker, Michelle; Nelson, Sheila; Krsnak, Jean",Professional case management,389,16

The effects of OPL on the splenic lymphocyte proliferation of mice were measured in vitro. The results showed that OPL could significantly promote lymphocyte proliferation singly or synergistically with PHA and LPS and that the effect was better than ophiopogon polysaccharide (OP) at most of concentrations. The adjuvant activities of OPL, OP and mineral oil were compared in BALB/c mice inoculated with inactivated PPV in vivo. The results showed that OPL could significantly enhance lymphocyte proliferation, increase the proportion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, improve the HI antibody titre and specific IgG response, and promote the production of cytokines, and the efficacy of OPL was significantly better than that of OP. In addition, OPL significantly improved the cellular immune response compared with oil adjuvant. These results suggested that OPL possess superior adjuvanticity and that a medium dose had the best efficacy. Therefore, OPL can be used as an effective immune adjuvant for an inactivated PPV vaccine.","Fan, Yunpeng; Ma, Xia; Hou, Weifeng; Guo, Chao; Zhang, Jing; Zhang, Weimin; Ma, Lin; Song, Xiaoping",International journal of biological macromolecules,389,26

The first part discusses the meanings of community, defined according to geographic, aggregate-interest, or epidemiological criteria. In the context of the pandemic, none of the three perspectives can be considered alone. The essay discusses the need to link different approaches in order to produce socially contextualized health interventions. Next, the authors present the four main models in the international literature that provide the basis for community participation practices in various countries. The analysis of community participation in the context of COVID-19 uses conceptual systematization based on two meta-narratives: utilitarian and social justice. The utilitarian perspective involves measures to restrict social contact. Participation is thus understood as collaboration in implementing measures that contribute to controlling the problem. The social justice perspective especially addresses the social determinants of health and reduction in social inequalities. The approach focuses on community empowerment and the search for solutions to the social and economic problems that determine the spread of COVID-19 and other diseases. The essay concludes on the peculiarities and importance of each approach. Community participation in the fight against COVID-19 should consider the emergency contexts to strengthen the health system and the defense of the social protection system and democracy.","Bispo Júnior, José Patrício; Morais, Marciglei Brito",Cadernos de saude publica,389,29

Yet score-based categorical exclusions used in critical care triage guidelines disproportionately discriminate against older adults, the cognitively and physically impaired, and the disabled. Adults over the age of 60, who make up 9.1% of the SA population, are most likely to present with disabilities and comorbidities at triage. Score-based models, drawn from international precedents, deny these patients admission to an ICU when resources are constrained, such as during influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks. The Critical Care Society of Southern Africa and the South African Medical Association adopted the Clinical Frailty Scale, which progressively withholds admission to ICUs based on age, frailty and comorbidities in a manner that potentially contravenes constitutional and equality prohibitions against unfair discrimination. The legal implications for healthcare providers are extensive, ranging from personal liability to hate speech and crimes against humanity. COVID-19 guidelines and score-based triage protocols must be revised urgently to eliminate unlawful discrimination against legally protected categories of patients in SA, including the disabled and the elderly.

This study investigated whether the routine use of methylene blue intraoperatively identified leaks to reduce the postoperative proportion of clinical leaks. METHODS This study retrospectively analyzed consecutive total gastrectomies performed from January 2007 to December 2014 in a university hospital setting by a general surgical group that exclusively used the methylene blue test. All surgeries were performed for gastric or junctional cancers (n = 198). All reconstructions (Roux-en Y esophagojejunostomy) were performed using a stapler. The methylene blue test was used in 108 cases (group 1) via a nasojejunal tube. No test was performed for the other 90 cases (group 2). Intraoperative leakage rate, postoperative clinical leakage rate, length of hospitalization, and mortality rate were the outcome measures. RESULTS The intraoperative leakage rate was 7.4% in group 1. The postoperative clinical leakage rate was 8.6%. The postoperative clinical leakage rate was 3.7% in group 1 and 14.4% in group 2 (p = 0.007). There were no postoperative clinical leaks when an intraoperative leak led to concomitant intraoperative repair. The median length of hospital stay was 6 days in group 1 and 8 days in group 2 (p < 0.001). One death occurred in each group. No test-related complications were observed.

DESIGN Responses to fictitious medical diagnoses were compared between Asian-Americans and European-North Americans in experiment 1 and between Canadians primed with an interdependent versus an independent self-construal in experiment 3. In experiment 2, the responses of Chinese and Canadians who were either heavy or light soft drink consumers were assessed after reading an article linking soft drink consumption to insulin resistance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The primary-dependent measure reflected participants' defensiveness about threatening versus nonthreatening health information. RESULTS In experiment 1, all participants responded more defensively to an unfavourable than a favourable diagnosis; however, Asian-Americans responded less defensively than did European-North Americans. In experiment 2, all high soft drink consumers were less convinced by the threatening information than were low soft drink consumers; however, among high consumers, Chinese changed their self-reported consumption levels less than did European-Canadians. In experiment 3, interdependence-primed participants responded less defensively to an unfavourable diagnosis than did independence-primed participants. CONCLUSION Defensive reactions to threatening health information were found consistently; however, self-enhancement was more pronounced in individuals with Western cultural backgrounds or independent self-construals.","Jacobson, Jill A; Ji, Li-Jun; Ditto, Peter H; Zhang, Zhiyong; Sorkin, Dara H; Warren, Sarah K; Legnini, Veronica; Ebel-Lam, Anna; Roper-Coleman, Sarah",Psychology & health,389,1

METHODS B. pertussis infection was studied by culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) from nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs) in 49 infants < 12 months of age, who were admitted for lower respiratory tract infections during the winter season. Seven other possible viral pathogens were documented by antigen detection or PCR in NPSs. The clinical feature of infants with mixed infection of B. pertussis and respiratory viruses were examined. RESULTS Overall, B. pertussis infection was found in 10 (20.4%) cases, nine were less than 6 months of age and seven were unvaccinated. Viral etiology was found in 41 (84%) cases and pertussis-viral co-infection was present in eight patients, five of whom had mixed infection with respiratory syncytial virus. Only the presence of staccato coughing, cyanosis, and lymphocytosis were significantly different in B. pertussis-positive cases compared with B. pertussis-negative cases. Of the 10 pertussis cases, only the culture-positive cases showed the typical symptoms and laboratory findings of pertussis in addition to virus-associated respiratory symptoms with severe hospital course, whereas cases identified as DNA-positive lacked the characteristics of pertussis and their clinical severities were the same as B. pertussis-negative cases. CONCLUSION In the absence of typical paroxysmal cough and lymphocytosis, we should carefully consider diagnosis of pertussis in young children hospitalized for presumed viral respiratory illness according to local epidemiological surveillance.","Mihara, Yuka; Yoshino, Shuji; Nakatani, Keigo; Nishimura, Toyoki; Kan, Hiromi; Yamamura, Yoshiko; Tanaka, Etsuko; Ishii, Shigeki; Shimonodan, Hidemi; Okada, Kenji; Nishiguchi, Toshihiro",Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,389,1

The body automatically adjusts for stress, exercise, altitude, and mild disease by increasing the volume and frequency of breathing. Longer term adaptations for exercise and altitude include increases in red blood cell counts and higher concentrations of capillaries in muscle tissue. When more challenging external environmental conditions or pulmonary illnesses exceed the capability for these adaptations, the human system requires technology to maintain sufficient ventilation to preserve life. On the environmental side there are two conditions to be addressed: toxicity of the surrounding atmosphere and changes in external pressure and O2 concentration. On the medical side, mechanisms for assisting breathing include O2 supplementation at ambient pressure, positive pressure/flow without additional O2, or a combination of both. This overview describes the various technologies applied to maintaining a safe breathing environment. Topics for environmental intervention include filter-based and flowing air-supply masks for toxic environments (occupational and laboratory protection), and on-demand gas supply systems for firefighters, self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (SCUBA) divers, and altitude (high performance aircraft, spacecraft) applications. The topics for medical intervention include nasal cannula, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and medical ventilators. The primary purpose of this article is to provide a basic understanding of normal human breathing and the adaptation of breathing in different environments using available technologies.","Pleil, Joachim D; Wallace, Ariel; Davis, Michael D; Matty, Christopher",Journal of breath research,389,16

The aim of this study was to unveil the consequences of this pandemic on hospitalizations and on mortality in a pediatric hospital. Methods: A descriptive and retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out using hospitalization and death statistics collected from a pediatric hospital. We compared the data before and after the pandemic and made predictions for the next 12 months. Results: A drastic drop in hospitalizations was noted coinciding with the partial lockdown in Cameroon. Paradoxically, at the same time, the number of deaths per month doubled though the causes remained the same as in the past. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic was marked by drop in hospitalizations and paradoxically, an increase in child mortality. These deaths were probably due not to SARS-Cov-2 infection, but rather due to the usual illnesses whose management was delayed, a probable consequence of the confinement.","Chelo, David; Mekone Nkwelle, Isabelle; Nguefack, Félicitée; Mbassi Awa, Hubert Désiré; Enyama, Dominique; Nguefack, Séraphin; Noukeu Njinkui, Diomède; Tony Nengom, Jocelyn; Nguefack-Tsague, Georges; Koki Ndombo, Paul Olivier",Fetal and pediatric pathology,389,30

METHODS Six semi-structured phone interviews were conducted with veterinarians who have submitted samples for HeV antibody titre testing. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed to identify and report common themes within the data. RESULTS Veterinarians are predominantly using the titre tests as an alternative to vaccination due to clients' fear of vaccine reactions. The high cost of titre testing, the difficulty interpreting titre results and a lack of titre test recognition by authorities were the major barriers reported to using this test. Some veterinarians detailed difficulties communicating titre test procedures and results to their clients. The majority of veterinarians accepted titres of 64 or greater as evidence of protective immunity and would rely on those results for 12 months. However, there was discrepancy of these values and the level of confidence veterinarians had in interpreting the results of HeV antibody titre tests varied. CONCLUSION This study has provided an overview of the attitudes of horse owners and veterinarians towards HeV antibody titre testing. Although evidence for HeV vaccination titres as an indication of protective immunity is still inadequate, it will assist veterinarians in interpreting and communicating titre results.","Barrett, R S; Wiethoelter, A; Halpin, K",Australian veterinary journal,389,16

Indeed, the drastic changes in vision have been reported in many aquatic amniotes, convergently. Recently, the opsin genes of the full-aquatic sea snakes have been reported. However, those of the amphibious sea snakes have not been examined in detail. RESULTS Here, we investigated opsin genes and visual pigments of sea snakes. We determined the sequences of SWS1, LWS, and RH1 genes from one terrestrial, three amphibious and four fully-aquatic elapids. Amino acid replacements at four and one spectra-tuning positions were found in LWS and RH1, respectively. We measured or predicted absorption of LWS and RH1 pigments with A1-derived retinal. During their evolution, blue shifts of LWS pigments have occurred stepwise in amphibious sea snakes and convergently in both amphibious and fully-aquatic species. CONCLUSIONS Blue shifted LWS pigments may have adapted to deep water or open water environments dominated by blue light. The evolution of opsins differs between marine mammals (cetaceans and pinnipeds) and sea snakes in two fundamental ways: (1) pseudogenization of opsins in marine mammals; and (2) large blue shifts of LWS pigments in sea snakes. It may be possible to explain these two differences at the level of photoreceptor cell composition given that cone and rod cells both exist in mammals whereas only cone cells exist in fully-aquatic sea snakes. We hypothesize that the differences in photoreceptor cell compositions may have differentially affected the evolution of opsins in divergent amniote lineages.","Seiko, Takashi; Kishida, Takushi; Toyama, Mina; Hariyama, Takahiko; Okitsu, Takashi; Wada, Akimori; Toda, Mamoru; Satta, Yoko; Terai, Yohey",BMC evolutionary biology,389,1

This article reports the results of the first in experiences with the p48MW (p48 Movable Wire) in humans, a device specifically designed to target vessels 1.75-3 mm in diameter. METHODS This monocentric study retrospectively reviewed the prospectively maintained database to identify all patients treated with the p48MW device between January 2017 and January 2019 at this institution. Patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, angiographic and clinical follow-up were recorded as well as complications. RESULTS A total of 25 patients (20 female) with an average age of 55 ± 12.9 years (range 34-84) with 25 aneurysms were identified. The majority of the aneurysms was located in the anterior circulation (19/25, 76%). The average aneurysm dome width was 3.98 ± 3.6 mm (range 1.2-13 mm). Complete occlusion was seen in 18/24 (75%) aneurysms with neck remnants in 1/24 (4.2%) and continued aneurysm filling seen in the remaining cases (5/24, 20.8%). Adequate occlusion was seen in 79.2% of aneurysms (Raymond Roy Classification [RRC] grade I or II) during the follow-up period. There was a single technical complication with inappropriate deployment of the first p48MW. There was a single clinical complication (4%); however, the patient made a complete recovery (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0) and one patient died secondary to uncontrollable status epilepticus following acute subarachnoid hemorrhage unrelated to the treatment. CONCLUSION The p48MW is safe and effective for the treatment of aneurysms including those arising from distal vessels.","Bhogal, P; Bleise, C; Chudyk, J; Lylyk, I; Viso, R; Perez, N; Henkes, H; Lylyk, P",Clinical neuroradiology,389,16

Therapeutic strategies that can eliminate Tregs in the tumor (i.e., therapies that do not run the risk of affecting normal tissues), are urgently needed for the development of cancer immunotherapies. Here we report our discovery of B-cell lymphoma extra-large (BCL-XL) as a potential molecular target of tumor-infiltrating (TI) Tregs. We show that pharmacological degradation of BCL-XL using a newly developed platelet-sparing BCL-XL Proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) induces the apoptosis of TI-Tregs and the activation of TI-CD8+ T cells. Moreover, these activities result in an effective suppression of syngeneic tumor growth in immunocompetent, but not in immunodeficient or CD8+ T cell-depleted mice. Notably, treatment with BCL-XL PROTAC does not cause detectable damage within several normal tissues or thrombocytopenia. These findings identify BCL-XL as a target in the elimination of TI-Tregs as a component of cancer immunotherapies, and that the BCL-XL-specific PROTAC has the potential to be developed as a therapeutic for cancer immunotherapy.","Kolb, Ryan; De, Umasankar; Khan, Sajid; Luo, Yuewan; Kim, Myung-Chul; Yu, Haijun; Wu, Chaoyan; Mo, Jiao; Zhang, Xin; Zhang, Peiyi; Zhang, Xuan; Borcherding, Nicholas; Koppel, Daniel; Fu, Yang-Xin; Zheng, Song Guo; Avram, Dorina; Zheng, Guangrong; Zhou, Daohong; Zhang, Weizhou",Nature communications,389,1

The monodispersed mesoporous Fe3O4 nanospheres with self-assembled carboxyl terminated shell have been prepared via a simple solvothermal method. These as-synthesized mesoporous Fe3O4 nanospheres showed a high magnetic saturation value (Ms = 46 emu g-1) and large specific surface area (111.12 m2 g-1) which made them potential candidates as sorbents in magnetic solid-phase extraction. The adsorption experimental data fitted well with the Freundlich-Langmuir isotherm and followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Moreover influential parameters on extraction efficiency were investigated and optimized. Under optimal conditions, the limits of detection for KNM and NEO were 1.0 and 0.1 ng mL-1, respectively. Recovery assessments using real samples exhibited recoveries in the range of 96.0 ± 4.3 to 101.5 ± 7.1 %, with relative standard deviations of <10.7% (for intra- day) and <14.6% (for inter- day). The proposed method was successfully applied for different spiked and un-spiked MMR vaccine samples.

These flow fluctuations have shown incidental association with rupture in a small aneurysm dataset. The aims of this study are to explore the capabilities and limitations of a commercial cfd solver in capturing such velocity fluctuations, whether fluctuation kinetic energy (fKE) as a marker to quantify such instability could be a potential parameter to predict aneurysm rupture, and what geometric parameters might be associated with such fluctuations. First, we confirmed that the second-order discretization schemes and high spatial and temporal resolutions are required to capture these aneurysmal flow fluctuations. Next, we analyzed 56 patient-specific middle cerebral artery (MCA) aneurysms (12 ruptured) by transient, high-resolution CFD simulations with a cycle-averaged, constant inflow boundary condition. Finally, to explore the mechanism by which such flow instabilities might arise, we investigated correlations between fKE and several aneurysm geometrical parameters. Our results show that flow instabilities were present in 8 of 56 MCA aneurysms, all of which were unruptured bifurcation aneurysms. Statistical analysis revealed that fKE could not differentiate ruptured from unruptured aneurysms. Thus, our study does not lend support to these flow instabilities (based on a cycle-averaged constant inflow as opposed to peak velocity) being a marker for rupture. We found a positive correlation between fKE and aneurysm size as well as size ratio. This suggests that the intrinsic flow instability may be associated with the breakdown of an inflow jet penetrating the aneurysm space.","Varble, Nicole; Xiang, Jianping; Lin, Ning; Levy, Elad; Meng, Hui",Journal of biomechanical engineering,389,1

HEV infection in pregnant women results in a more severe outcome, with the mortality rate going up to 30%. Though the virus usually causes sporadic infection, epidemics have been reported in developing and resource-starved countries. No specific antiviral exists against HEV. A combination of interferon and ribavirin therapy has been used to control the disease with some success. Zinc is an essential micronutrient that plays crucial roles in multiple cellular processes. Zinc salts are known to be effective in reducing infections caused by few viruses. Here, we investigated the effect of zinc salts on HEV replication. In a human hepatoma cell (Huh7) culture model, zinc salts inhibited the replication of genotype 1 (g-1) and g-3 HEV replicons and g-1 HEV infectious genomic RNA in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of a replication-defective mutant of g-1 HEV genomic RNA under similar conditions ruled out the possibility of zinc salts acting on replication-independent processes. An ORF4-Huh7 cell line-based infection model of g-1 HEV further confirmed the above observations. Zinc salts did not show any effect on the entry of g-1 HEV into the host cell. Furthermore, our data reveal that zinc salts directly inhibit the activity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), leading to inhibition of viral replication. Taken together, these studies unravel the ability of zinc salts in inhibiting HEV replication, suggesting their possible therapeutic value in controlling HEV infection.IMPORTANCE Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a public health concern in resource-starved countries due to frequent outbreaks. It is also emerging as a health concern in developed countries owing to its ability to cause acute and chronic infection in organ transplant and immunocompromised individuals. Although antivirals such as ribavirin have been used to treat HEV cases, there are known side effects and limitations of such therapy. Our discovery of the ability of zinc salts to block HEV replication by virtue of their ability to inhibit the activity of viral RdRp is important because these findings pave the way to test the efficacy of zinc supplementation therapy in HEV-infected patients. Since zinc supplementation therapy is known to be safe in healthy individuals and since high-dose zinc is used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, it may be possible to control HEV-associated health problems following a similar treatment regimen.","Kaushik, Nidhi; Subramani, Chandru; Anang, Saumya; Muthumohan, Rajagopalan; Shalimar,; Nayak, Baibaswata; Ranjith-Kumar, C T; Surjit, Milan",Journal of virology,389,1

Nucleic acid based amplification tests (NATs) for respiratory viruses were first introduced two decades ago and today are utilized for the detection of both conventional and emerging viruses. These tests are more sensitive than other diagnostic approaches, including virus isolation in cell culture, shell vial culture (SVC), antigen detection by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining, and rapid enzyme immunoassay (EIA), and now form the backbone of clinical virology laboratory testing around the world. NATs not only provide fast, accurate and sensitive detection of respiratory viruses in clinical specimens but also have increased our understanding of the epidemiology of both new emerging viruses such as the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus of 2009, and conventional viruses such as the common cold viruses, including rhinovirus and coronavirus. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays introduced in the last five years detect up to 19 different viruses in a single test. Several multiplex PCR tests are now commercially available and tests are working their way into clinical laboratories. The final chapter in the evolution of respiratory virus diagnostics has been the addition of allelic discrimination and detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with antiviral resistance. These assays are now being multiplexed with primary detection and subtyping assays, especially in the case of influenza virus. These resistance assays, together with viral load assays, will enable clinical laboratories to provide physicians with new and important information for optimal treatment of respiratory virus infections.","Mahony, James B; Petrich, Astrid; Smieja, Marek",Critical reviews in clinical laboratory sciences,389,16

After all assessments were completed, two 12-item questionnaires, one for students and one for the faculty members who conducted the assessment, were designed to assess perceptions of virtual skills-based assessments. The surveys were distributed via an online platform to second- and third-year (P2 and P3) pharmacy students and to faculty who had participated in a virtual skills-based assessment. Scores from the spring 2020 virtual skills-based assessment were compared to scores on the in-person skills-based assessment that took place in spring 2019.Results Of the 19 faculty and 279 students invited to participate, 18 (94.7%) faculty and 241 (86.4%) students responded. The majority of faculty (88.9%) and students (63.5%) perceived the virtual skills-based assessments to be effective at simulating an interaction. However, only 33.3% of faculty and 28.6% of students preferred the virtual environment. There was not a significant difference in student performance between in-person and virtual assessments for patient consultation and SOAP note skills.Conclusion Providing sufficient formative and summative feedback to pharmacy students is a challenge, particularly in the context of skills-based assessments. Students and faculty reported that the virtual assessment provided an opportunity for an appropriate assessment of student communication skills. However, a strong preference for using virtual skills-based assessments in the future was not observed.","VanLangen, Kali M; Sahr, Michelle J; Salvati, Lisa A; Meny, Lisa M; Bright, David R; Sohn, Minji",American journal of pharmaceutical education,389,16

Therapeutic interventions currently used to treat these deficits are only partially efficacious, which is a consequence of limited understanding of the mechanism of action of ethanol. Here, we describe a novel effect of ethanol in the developing brain. Specifically, we show that exposure of rats to ethanol in vapor chambers during the equivalent to the third trimester of human pregnancy causes brain micro-hemorrhages. This effect was observed both at low and high doses of ethanol vapor exposure, and was not specific to this exposure paradigm as it was also observed when ethanol was administered via intra-esophageal gavage. The vast majority of the micro-hemorrhages were located in the cerebral cortex but were also observed in the hypothalamus, midbrain, olfactory tubercle, and striatum. The auditory, cingulate, insular, motor, orbital, retrosplenial, somatosensory, and visual cortices were primarily affected. Immunohistochemical experiments showed that the micro-hemorrhages caused neuronal loss, as well as reactive astrogliosis and microglial activation. Analysis with the Catwalk test revealed subtle deficits in motor function during adolescence/young adulthood. In conclusion, our study provides additional evidence linking developmental ethanol exposure with alterations in the fetal cerebral vasculature. Given that this effect was observed at moderate levels of ethanol exposure, our findings lend additional support to the recommendation that women abstain from consuming alcoholic beverages during pregnancy.","Welch, J H; Mayfield, J J; Leibowitz, A L; Baculis, B C; Valenzuela, C F",Neuroscience,389,1

However, risks and benefits of this adjunctive therapy remain uncertain. We aimed to evaluate periprocedural intravenous heparin use in Dutch stroke intervention centers and to assess its efficacy and safety. Methods- Patients registered between March 2014 and June 2016 in the MR CLEAN Registry (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke), including all patients treated with endovascular treatment in the Netherlands, were analyzed. The primary outcome was functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were successful recanalization (extended Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction ≥2B), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and mortality at 90 days. We used multilevel regression analysis to evaluate the association of periprocedural intravenous heparin on outcomes, adjusted for center effects and prognostic factors. To account for possible unobserved confounding by indication, we analyzed the effect of center preference to administer intravenous heparin, defined as percentage of patients treated with intravenous heparin in a center, on functional outcome. Results- One thousand four hundred eighty-eight patients from 16 centers were analyzed, of whom 398 (27%) received intravenous heparin (median dose 5000 international units). There was substantial between-center variability in the proportion of patients treated with intravenous heparin (range, 0%-94%). There was no significant difference in functional outcome between patients treated with intravenous heparin and those without (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.87-1.56), successful recanalization (adjusted odds ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.89-1.71), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.65-1.99), or mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.66-1.38). Analysis at center level showed that functional outcomes were better in centers with higher percentages of heparin administration (adjusted common odds ratio, 1.07 per 10% more heparin, 95% CI, 1.01-1.13). Conclusions- Substantial between-center variability exists in periprocedural intravenous heparin use during endovascular treatment, but the treatment is safe. Centers using heparin more often had better outcomes. A randomized trial is needed to further study these effects.","van de Graaf, Rob A; Chalos, Vicky; van Es, Adriaan C G M; Emmer, Bart J; Lycklama À Nijeholt, Geert J; van der Worp, H Bart; Schonewille, Wouter J; van der Lugt, Aad; Dippel, Diederik W J; Lingsma, Hester F; Roozenbeek, Bob",Stroke,389,24

The two principal devices used for OLV are a double-lumen tube (DLT) and a bronchial blocker (BB). We hypothesized that the use of a BB with the disconnection technique would improve the quality of lung collapse in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Methods Seventy-five patients undergoing scheduled VATS were enrolled in this study and were randomly divided into two groups: a left-sided DLT group (Group D) and a BB with the disconnection technique group (Group B). OLV was initiated when the surgeon performed the skin incision. In Group D, the left channel of the DLT was opened to the air. In Group B, the lung was deflated via the disconnection technique, thus opening the breathing circuit to the air fifteen seconds after opening the pleura. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) during induction; the quality of lung collapse 1 and 10 minutes after pleural opening; the time required for complete lung collapse; the correct placement of the device; and the number of patients suffering from a sore throat after surgery were recorded. Results Compared with the use of the DLT, the use of the BB with the disconnection technique was associated with a similar quality of lung collapse, a comparable required time for total lung collapse (P>0.05, respectively), a lower incidence of sore throat both when leaving the PACU and 24 hours after surgery (34.2% vs. 13.5%, 15.8% vs. 5.4%, P<0.05, respectively) and fewer hemodynamic fluctuations after intubation both one and ten minutes after pleural opening. Conclusions The use of a BB with the disconnection technique in VATS offers an effective method for improving the quality of lung collapse and reducing postoperative sore throat.","Cheng, Qian; He, Zhiyong; Xue, Ping; Xu, Qianyun; Zhu, Minmin; Chen, Wankun; Miao, Changhong",Journal of thoracic disease,389,31

Many clinical trials will have more missing data because of a participant's inability to attend in-person visits, discontinuation of trial activities, or interruption of time-sensitive study collection data due to COVID-19. All of these events affect the data quality of trials. Government agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and National Institutes of Health (NIH) have issued recommendations for investigators conducting clinical trials to combat the spread of COVID-19 and to maintain data integrity. Institutions sponsoring clinical trials have also provided guidelines to continue, modify, or pause research studies that are essential to ensure participant and research team safety. Key recommendations include implementing telehealth appointments, wearing a protective mask and face shield, quarantining for 14 days if exposed to COVID-19 or having traveled, and, if possible, maintaining a 6-foot distance. It is also recommended that investigators implement COVID-19 screening questionnaires prior to and during on-site visits. This includes participants and research personnel completing a temperature check and questionnaire screen before in-person data collection.

Based on the pattern of factor loadings and on previous labeling in felid personality research, we labeled the factors as Boldness, Dominance, Neuroticism, and Attentiveness. The results were similar to that of the previous studies on felids, although some differences were found, which could be due to the evolutionary distance among species and to methodological differences among studies. Future research on endangered felids could provide insights into the influence of personality on conservation outcomes related to successful breeding and reintroduction.

OBJECTIVE This systematic review aims to evaluate the usability of eHealth and mobile health (mHealth) interventions currently available for young people living with JIA. METHODS The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were used to oversee this review. We systematically searched 15 databases for 252 potential studies; 2 authors independently screened all quantitative studies reporting the use of eHealth and mHealth interventions for young people (aged 1-18 years) diagnosed with JIA. Studies were excluded if they did not report outcome measures or were reviews, commentaries, or qualitative studies. Study methodological quality was scored using the Down and Black (modified) checklist. A narrative descriptive methodology was used to quantify the data because of heterogeneity across the studies. RESULTS A total of 11 studies were included in this review, reporting 7 eHealth and mHealth interventions for young people (aged 4-18 years) living with JIA, targeting health issues such as pain, health-related quality of life, physical activity, and chronic disease self-management. The usability of the interventions was facilitated through training and ongoing support. The engagement was promoted by a combination of persuasive influences, and barriers preventing adherence were removed through personal reminders and flexible program schedules to cater to JIA and non-JIA illnesses or other commonly seen activities in childhood. The feedback obtained was that most young people and their parents liked the interventions. CONCLUSIONS The results of this review need to be considered cautiously because of the lack of rigorous testing and heterogeneity, which limits the detailed descriptions of data synthesis. Further research is needed to consider gender differences, associated costs, and the effectiveness of the interventions on health outcomes to better support young people living with JIA.","Butler, Sonia; Sculley, Dean; Santos, Derek Santos; Fellas, Antoni; Gironès, Xavier; Singh-Grewal, Davinder; Coda, Andrea",JMIR pediatrics and parenting,389,27

Twenty-five trained males completed five training sessions of 60 min over 7 days in HOT (n = 13) or COOL (n = 12) conditions, consisting of a submaximal warm-up and four sets of maximal sprints. Before and after the intervention, intermittent shuttle running performance was assessed in cool and repeated-sprint ability in hot conditions; the latter preceded and followed by neuromuscular function testing. During the repeated-sprint training sessions, skin (~8.4°C) and core (~0.17°C) temperatures were higher in HOT than COOL (p < 0.05) conditions. Shuttle running distance increased after both interventions (p < 0.001), with a non-significant (p = 0.131) but larger effect in HOT (315 m, d = 1.18) than COOL (207 m, d = 0.51) conditions. Mean (~7%, p < 0.001) and peak (~5%, p < 0.05) power during repeated-sprinting increased following both interventions, whereas peak twitch force before the repeated-sprint assessment was ~10% lower after the interventions (p = 0.001). Heart rate during the repeated-sprint warm-up was reduced (~6 beats.min-1) following both interventions (p < 0.01). Rectal temperature was ~0.14°C lower throughout the repeated-sprint assessment after the interventions (p < 0.001), with larger effects in HOT than COOL during the warm-up (p = 0.082; d = -0.53 vs. d = -0.15) and repeated-sprints (p = 0.081; d = -0.54 vs. d = -0.02).

However, spontaneous breathing (SB) efforts can produce entrained ""M-wave"" airway pressure waveforms that inhibit identification of accurate values for respiratory system elastance and airway resistance. A pressure wave reconstruction method is proposed to accurately identify respiratory mechanics, assess the level of SB effort, and quantify the incidence of SB effort without uncommon measuring devices or interruption to care. METHODS Data from 275 breaths aggregated from all mechanically ventilated patients at Christchurch Hospital were used in this study. The breath specific respiratory elastance is calculated using a time-varying elastance model. A pressure reconstruction method is proposed to reconstruct pressure waves identified as being affected by SB effort. The area under the curve of the time-varying respiratory elastance (AUC Edrs) are calculated and compared, where unreconstructed waves yield lower AUC Edrs. The difference between the reconstructed and unreconstructed pressure is denoted as a surrogate measure of SB effort. RESULTS The pressure reconstruction method yielded a median AUC Edrs of 19.21 [IQR: 16.30-22.47]cmH2Os/l. In contrast, the median AUC Edrs for unreconstructed M-wave data was 20.41 [IQR: 16.68-22.81]cmH2Os/l. The pressure reconstruction method had the least variability in AUC Edrs assessed by the robust coefficient of variation (RCV)=0.04 versus 0.05 for unreconstructed data. Each patient exhibited different levels of SB effort, independent from MV setting, indicating the need for non-invasive, real time assessment of SB effort. CONCLUSION A simple reconstruction method enables more consistent real-time estimation of the true, underlying respiratory system mechanics of a SB patient and provides the surrogate of SB effort, which may be clinically useful for clinicians in determining optimal ventilator settings to improve patient care.","Damanhuri, Nor Salwa; Chiew, Yeong Shiong; Othman, Nor Azlan; Docherty, Paul D; Pretty, Christopher G; Shaw, Geoffrey M; Desaive, Thomas; Chase, J Geoffrey",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,389,1

However, the role of RBM39 in alternative splicing is poorly understood. METHODS In this study, RBM39-mediated global alternative splicing was investigated using RNA-Seq and genome-wide RBM39-RNA interactions were mapped via cross-linking and immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (CLIP-Seq) in wild-type and RBM39-knockdown MCF-7 cells. RESULTS RBM39 was involved in the up- or down-regulation of the transcript levels of various genes. Hundreds of alternative splicing events regulated by endogenous RBM39 were identified. The majority of these events were cassette exons. Genes containing RBM39-regulated alternative exons were found to be linked to G2/M transition, cellular response to DNA damage, adherens junctions and endocytosis. CLIP-Seq analysis showed that the binding site of RBM39 was mainly in proximity to 5' and 3' splicing sites. Considerable RBM39 binding to mRNAs encoding proteins involved in translation was observed. Of particular importance, ~20% of the alternative splicing events that were significantly regulated by RBM39 were similarly regulated by U2AF65. CONCLUSIONS RBM39 is extensively involved in alternative splicing of RNA and helps regulate transcript levels. RBM39 may modulate alternative splicing similarly to U2AF65 by either directly binding to RNA or recruiting other splicing factors, such as U2AF65. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE The current study offers a genome-wide view of RBM39's regulatory function in alternative splicing. RBM39 may play important roles in multiple cellular processes by regulating both alternative splicing of RNA molecules and transcript levels.","Mai, Sanyue; Qu, Xiuhua; Li, Ping; Ma, Qingjun; Cao, Cheng; Liu, Xuan",Biochimica et biophysica acta,389,12

This situation is further being deteriorated due to the negative effects of abiotic stresses. Under such conditions, plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are found to improve crop production which is essential for sustainable agriculture. This study is focused on the isolation of potent arsenic (As)-resistant PGPR from the agricultural land of West Bengal, India, and its application to reduce As translocation in rice seedlings. After screening, an As-resistant PGPR strain AS18 was identified by phenotypic characters and 16S rDNA sequence-based homology as Pantoea dispersa. This strain displayed nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase (ACCD) activity, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production, in addition to As (III) resistance up to 3750 μg/mL. The As removal efficiency of this strain was up to 93.12% from the culture medium as evidenced by AAS. The bioaccumulation property of AS18 strain was further validated by TEM-EDAX-XRD-XRF-FTIR studies. This strain showed significant morpho-biochemical improvements including antioxidant enzymatic activities and As-minimization in plant (rice) cells. Thus, being an As-resistant potent PGPR, AS18 strain is expected to be applied in As-spiked agricultural fields for bioremediation and phytostimulation.","Ghosh, Antara; Pramanik, Krishnendu; Bhattacharya, Shatabda; Mondal, Sayanta; Ghosh, Sudip Kumar; Ghosh, Pallab Kumar; Maiti, Tushar Kanti",Environmental science and pollution research international,389,33

MATERIALS AND METHODS Subjects were selected among patients scheduled for a biopsy or ablation procedure. The lesions were not visible with conventional imaging methods or did not have uniform uptake on PET. Clinical success was defined by adequate histopathologic specimens for molecular profiling or diagnosis and by lack of enhancement on follow-up imaging for ablation procedures. Time to target (time elapsed between the completion of the initial cone-beam CT scan and first tissue sample or treatment), total procedure time (time from the moment the patient was on the table until the patient was off the table), and number of times the needle was repositioned were recorded. RESULTS Seven patients underwent eight procedures (two ablations and six biopsies). Registration and procedures were completed successfully in all cases. Clinical success was achieved in all biopsy procedures and in one of the two ablation procedures. The needle was repositioned once in one biopsy procedure only. On average, the time to target was 38 minutes (range 13-54 min). Total procedure time was 95 minutes (range 51-240 min, which includes composite ablation). On average, fluoroscopy time was 2.5 minutes (range 1.3-6.2 min). CONCLUSIONS An integrated cone-beam CT software platform can enable PET-guided biopsies and ablation procedures without the need for additional specialized hardware.","Abi-Jaoudeh, Nadine; Mielekamp, Peter; Noordhoek, Niels; Venkatesan, Aradhana M; Millo, Corina; Radaelli, Alessandro; Carelsen, Bart; Wood, Bradford J",Journal of vascular and interventional radiology : JVIR,389,10

In fact, the treatment of a lesion is only possible when the GW is passed beyond the target lesion. Lower limb percutaneous arterial revascularisation can be achieved using a variety of GWs which may differ in calibre, body, tip or coating. As the choice of an appropriate GW is critical for the success of a lower limb artery angioplasty, knowledge of the properties and performances of different GWs should be well known in order to tailor the choice of the device to the lesion characteristics and location, as well as to the intended revascularisation strategy.

Subsequent to finding many coccoid, bacillary, and ring-shaped organisms, consistent with hemotropic mycoplasmas, on RBCs from a 72-day-old female white-tailed fawn, we sought to (1) identify the putative hemoplasma observed in blood from the fawn, (2) evaluate others in the herd for hemoplasma infection, and (3) identify clinicopathologic characteristics of hemoplasma-infected white-tailed deer. EDTA-anticoagulated whole blood was collected from the fawn and 8 apparently healthy does in the same herd. CBCs were performed on 7 nonclotted samples from the fawn and 6 does. DNA was extracted from all samples, followed by PCR amplification of bacterial (16S rDNA) and protozoal (18S rDNA) genes. The nearly complete 16S rDNA product from the fawn's sample was directly sequenced and compared with known sequences in the GenBank database. Samples from the fawn and 7 of 8 does were PCR-positive using hemoplasma-specific and M ovis-specific protocols. The fawn was PCR-negative for Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., and Theileria spp. The 16S rDNA sequence from the fawn (GenBank accession number, FJ824847) was most closely related to M ovis (AF338268), having 98.5% sequence identity. The fawn had a mild nonregenerative anemia, a neutrophilic left-shift with toxic change, aspiration bronchopneumonia, and gastrointestinal disease. Hematologic values, including blood film evaluation, in infected does were unremarkable. The M ovis-like organism may have acted as either an opportunistic or primary pathogen in the fawn. The high occurrence of subclinical infections in the does suggests that white-tailed deer may act as wildlife reservoirs for M ovis.","Boes, Katie M; Goncarovs, Kristina O; Thompson, Craig A; Halik, Lindsay A; Santos, Andrea P; Guimaraes, Ana M S; Feutz, Marybeth Miskovic; Holman, Patricia J; Vemulapalli, Ramesh; Messick, Joanne B",Veterinary clinical pathology,389,31

Clinically, however, the benefits of single-port TEP (SP TEP) are unclear. This study aimed to compare short-term surgical outcomes between SP TEP and conventional laparoscopic TEP(CL TEP) inguinal hernia repair. METHODS Between January 2013 and February 2015, 99 men with primary unilateral inguinal hernia were randomized to the single-port or conventional 3-port TEP procedures. The primary end point was postoperative pain. Secondary end points were complications, postoperative hospital stay, days to return to daily normal activities, cosmesis, and quality of life (QOL). RESULTS We randomized 50 patients to SP TEP and 49 to CL TEP repair. The SP TEP group patients had significantly lower pain scores (visual analog scale) 7 days postoperation (p = 0.017). However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in postoperative pain scores 24 h (p = 0.44) and 4 weeks (p = 0.677) after operation and analgesic requirements on the operation day (p = 0.303) and 7 days after the operation (p = 0.204). Operation time, postoperative hospital stay, and complications were comparable between the two groups. The days to return to daily normal activities, QOL, and cosmetic satisfaction were not different between the two groups. CONCLUSION The outcomes of SP TEP hernia repair for operation time and morbidities were comparable to CL TEP, and postoperative pain was lower at 7 days than in CL TEP hernia repair. The SP TEP technique can be recommended as an alternative treatment for inguinal hernia repair in experienced hands.","Choi, B J; Jeong, W J; Lee, I K; Lee, S C",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,389,16

However, events regulating EBV infection at early stages of the disease and the role of EBV in disease pathogenesis are largely undefined. Genetic alterations leading to activation of cyclin D1 signaling in premalignant nasopharyngeal epithelial (NPE) cells have been postulated to predispose cells to EBV infection. We previously reported that loss of p16, a negative regulator of cyclin D1 signaling, is a frequent feature of NPC tumors. Here, we report that early premalignant lesions of nasopharyngeal epithelium overexpress cyclin D1. Furthermore, overexpression of cyclin D1 is closely associated with EBV infection. Therefore we investigated the potential role of cyclin D1 overexpression in dysplastic NPE cells in vitro. In human telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized NPE cells, overexpression of cyclin D1 or a p16-resistant form of CDK4 (CDK4(R24C)) suppressed differentiation. This suppression may have implications for the close association of EBV infection with undifferentiated NPC. In these in vitro models, we found that cellular growth arrest and senescence occurred in EBV-infected cell populations immediately after infection. Nevertheless, overexpression of cyclin D1 or a p16-resistant form of CDK4 or knockdown of p16 in the human telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized NPE cell lines could counteract the EBV-induced growth arrest and senescence. We conclude that dysregulated expression of cyclin D1 in NPE cells may contribute to NPC pathogenesis by enabling persistent infection of EBV.","Tsang, Chi Man; Yip, Yim Ling; Lo, Kwok Wai; Deng, Wen; To, Ka Fai; Hau, Pok Man; Lau, Victoria Ming Yi; Takada, Kenzo; Lui, Vivian Wai Yan; Lung, Maria Li; Chen, Honglin; Zeng, Musheng; Middeldorp, Jaap Michiel; Cheung, Annie Lai-Man; Tsao, Sai Wah",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,389,33

A secondary aim was to compare the prevalence of smoking and snuff use before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS The study population includes 1644 participants aged 23-26 years from the Swedish population-based birth cohort BAMSE. From August to November 2020, the participants answered a web questionnaire on COVID-19 symptoms, lifestyle and health. Information on tobacco use was compared against the previous study follow-up in 2016-2019. RESULTS The prevalence of suspected COVID-19 symptoms was 45.3% (n=742), and 80 of these (10.8%) reported long-term symptoms (⩾4 weeks). There was no significant difference in sociodemographic or lifestyle factors in relation to the duration of suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Rhinitis, migraine and lower self-rated health before the pandemic was more common among participants with long-term symptoms. In addition, there was a tendency for higher prevalences of asthma, chronic bronchitis and depression in this group. The prevalence of smoking decreased from 18.9% before the pandemic to 14.7% during the pandemic, while snuff use increased from 12.7% to 22.4% (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Almost half of Swedish young adults have had symptoms of suspected COVID-19 from February up to August 2020. Among these, one out of 10 have had long-term symptoms for at least 4 weeks. Long-term symptoms of suspected COVID-19 were associated with several common chronic conditions. Smoking may have decreased during the pandemic, while snuff use may have increased.","Ekström, Sandra; Andersson, Niklas; Lövquist, Alexandra; Lauber, André; Georgelis, Antonios; Kull, Inger; Melén, Erik; Bergström, Anna",Scandinavian journal of public health,389,16

The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential predictors of both (1) engagement in behaviors aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 and (2) intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. It was hypothesized that Health Belief Model (HBM) constructs would predict each outcome. Additionally, given the politicization of the pandemic in the US, HBM constructs were considered as possible mediators of a relationship between political party affiliation and each outcome. A total of 205 participants completed an online survey, and data from 186 were analyzed using linear and ordinal regressions. Findings indicate that greater perceived response efficacy predicted greater engagement in preventive behaviors and intention to get vaccinated. Other HBM constructs were not significant predictors of either outcome. Mediation analyses indicated that affiliation with the Republican Party predicted reduced engagement in preventive health behaviors and vaccination intention, although effects were fully and partially mediated by lower levels of response efficacy. Understanding the predictors of adherence to recommended strategies is essential to developing effective public health campaigns that address risk factors for non-adherence and target those least likely to adhere. Public health interventions aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 in the US should emphasize the efficacy of preventive behaviors and encourage public trust in the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines, particularly among Republicans.","Rabin, Carolyn; Dutra, Sunny","Psychology, health & medicine",389,1

LncRNA NEAT1, miR-212-5p, and GRIA3 expression were detected both in high fatty acid-treated hepatocytes cells and NAFLD patients. Lipid droplets were stained and analyzed by oil red O staining. Expression of fatty acid synthase (FASN), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and GRIA3 was detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. RNA level of lncRNA NEAT1 and miR-212-5p was analyzed by qRT-PCR. The binding sequences of lncRNA NEAT1/miR-212-5p and miR-212-5p/GRIA3 were predicted bioinformatically and validated through luciferase assay. ChIP was performed to analyze H3K27 acetylation on the promoter of lncRNA NEAT1. LncRNA NEAT1 and GRIA3 was upregulated, while miR-212-5p was downregulated in NAFLD patients. FFA promoted lncRNA NEAT1 and GRIA3 expression while suppressing miR-212-5p and promoted lipid accumulation as indicated by increased oil red O staining and FAS and ACC expression. ChIP indicated enrichment of H3K27 on NEAT1 promoter. Inhibition of H3K27 acetylation suppressed lncRNA NEAT1 level. Luciferase results indicated direct interaction of NEAT1/miR-212-5p (which was confirmed by RIP) and miR-212-5p/GRIA3. LncRNA NEAT1 knockdown upregulated miR-212-5p level and inhibited FFA-induced lipid accumulation while suppressing GRIA3 expression. Such function was antagonized by miR-212-5p inhibition and GRIA3 knockdown counteracted with miR-212-5p inhibition. H3K27 acetylation was enriched within the promoter of lncRNA NEAT1 and promoted lncRNA NEAT1 transcription. LncRNA NEAT1 could then interact with miR-212-5p and suppress its cellular concentration.","Hu, Min-Jie; Long, Mei; Dai, Rong-Juan",Molecular and cellular biochemistry,389,7

Data were analyzed using univariate analysis, multivariate analysis, and trend line using line of best fit. RESULTS A total of 737 subjects were included in the study. There was a downward trend in the quantity of opioids prescribed for all 3 surgeries during the study period. There was a significant difference in the quantity of opioids prescribed pre- and postimplementation of MassPAT for tonsillectomy (647.70 ± 218.50 MME vs 474.60 ± 185.90 MME, P < .001), parotidectomy (241.20 ± 57.66 MME vs 156.70 ± 72.99 MME, P < .001), and thyroidectomy (171.20 ± 93.77 MME vs 108.50 ± 63.84 MME, P < .001). There was also a decrease in the number of patients who did not receive opioids for thyroidectomy pre- and post-MassPAT (7.56% vs 24.14%).

There are several topical antimicrobial wound care products available for use, however their effectiveness has routinely been demonstrated with planktonic microorganisms. There is no target reference value for antimicrobial effectiveness of wound care products in biofilm models. In addition, data on antimicrobial activity of products in biofilm models is scattered across many test methods in a variety of studies. The aim of this work is to directly compare commercial products containing the commonly used topical antimicrobial agents iodine, silver, PHMB, octenidine, hypochlorous acid, benzalkonium chloride, and a surfactant based topical containing poloxamer 188. Five different in vitro biofilm models of varied complexity were used, incorporating several bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, and Enterobacter. The fungal pathogens Candida albicans and Candida auris were also evaluated. A multispecies bacterial biofilm model was also used to evaluate the products. Additionally, C. albicans was used in combination with S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in a multikingdom version of the polymicrobial biofilm model. Statistically significant differences in antimicrobial performance were observed between treatments in each model and changing microbial growth conditions or combinations of organisms resulted in significant performance differences for some treatments. The iodine and benzalkonium chloride containing products were overall the most effective in vitro and were then selected for in vivo evaluation in an infected immunocompromised murine model. Unexpectedly, the iodine product was statistically (P > 0.05) no different than the untreated control, while the benzalkonium chloride containing product significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the biofilm compared to untreated control. This body of work demonstrates the importance of not only evaluating antimicrobial wound care products in biofilm models, but also the importance of using several different models to gain a comprehensive understanding of products' effectiveness.

Low-Density Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR) play a critical role in regulating blood cholesterol levels by binding to and clearing LDLs from the circulation. The disruption of the interaction between Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin 9 (PCSK9) and LDLR reduces blood cholesterol levels. It is not well known whether other members of the LDLR superfamily may be targets of PCSK9. The aim of this work was to determine if LDLR-related protein 5 (LRP5) is a PCSK9 target, and to study the role of PCSK9 and LRP5 in foam cell formation and lipid accumulation. METHODS AND RESULTS Primary cultures of human inflammatory cells (monocytes and macrophages) were silenced for LRP5 or PCSK9 and challenged with LDLs. We first show that LRP5 is needed for macrophage lipid uptake since LRP5-silenced macrophages show less intracellular CE accumulation. In macrophages, internalization of LRP5-bound LDL is already highly evident after 5 hours of LDL incubation and lasts up to 24hours; however in the absence of both LRP5 and PCSK9 there is a strong reduction of CE accumulation indicating a role for both proteins in lipid uptake. Immunoprecipitation experiments show that LRP5 forms a complex with PCSK9 in lipid-loaded macrophages. Finally PCSK9 participates in TLR4/NFkB signaling; a decreased TLR4 protein expression levels and a decreased nuclear translocation of NFκB was detected in PCSK9 silenced cells after lipid loading, indicating a down-regulation of the TLR4/NFκB pathway. CONCLUSION Our results show that both LRP5 and PCSK9 participate in lipid uptake in macrophages. In the absence of LRP5 there is a reduced release of PCSK9 indicating that LRP5 also participates in the mechanism of release of soluble PCSK9. Furthermore, PCSK9 up-regulates TLR4/NFκB favoring inflammation. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE We demonstrate that PCSK9 and LRP5 contribute to lipid uptake. We also show that LRP5 participates in PCSK9 transport to the plasma membrane and that PCSK9 inhibition protects against agLDL-induced inflammation associated to the TLR4/NFκB pathway. These results offer new targets to prevent the progression of inflammation and hypercholesterolemia and their increased risk of cardiovascular events.","Badimon, Lina; Luquero, Aureli; Crespo, Javier; Peña, Esther; Borrell-Pages, Maria",Cardiovascular research,389,1

Conventional coagulation assays do not always actively reflect these derangements and might fail to detect this coagulopathy. Viscoelastic hemostatic assays (VHA) provide a possible tool that adds to conventional coagulation assays in identifying this hypercoagulable state. VHA has been mostly used in surgery and trauma but it's still not well defined in sepsis patients with lack of large randomized trials. Few studies described VHA findings in patients with COVID-19 showing significant hypercoagulability and fibrinolysis shutdown. Clinicians taking care of these patients might have little experience interpreting VHA results.

Does passive heat acclimation alter glomerular filtration rate and urine concentrating ability in response to passive heat stress? What is the main finding and its importance? Glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged following passive heat stress, and heat acclimation did not alter this response. However, heat acclimation mitigated the reduction in urine concentrating ability and reduced the incidence of albuminuria in young healthy adults following passive heat stress. Collectively, these results suggest that passive heat acclimation may improve structural integrity and reduce glomerular permeability during passive heat stress. ABSTRACT Little is known about the effect of heat acclimation on kidney function during heat stress. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of passive heat stress and subsequent passive heat acclimation on markers of kidney function. Twelve healthy adults (7 males/5 females; 26 ± 5 y; 72.7 ± 8.6 kg; 172.4 ± 7.5 cm) underwent passive heat stress before and after a 7-day controlled hyperthermia heat acclimation protocol. The impact of passive heat exposure on urine and serum markers of kidney function was evaluated before and after heat acclimation. Glomerular filtration rate, determined from creatinine clearance, was unchanged with passive heat stress before (pre: 133 ± 41 mL/min; post: 127 ± 51 mL/min, P = 0.99) and after (pre: 129 ± 46 mL/min; post: 130 ± 36 mL/min, P = 0.99) heat acclimation. The urine-to-serum osmolality ratio was reduced following passive heating (P < 0.01), but heat acclimation did not alter this response. In comparison to baseline, free water clearance was greater following passive heating before (pre: -0.86 ± 0.67 mL/min, post: 0.40 ± 1.01 mL/min, P < 0.01) but not after (pre: -0.16 ± 0.57 mL/min, post: 0.76 ± 1.2 mL/min, P = 0.11) heat acclimation. Further, passive heating increased the fractional excretion rate of potassium (P < 0.03) but not sodium (P = 0.13) or chloride (P = 0.20). Lastly, heat acclimation reduced the fractional incidence of albuminuria following passive heating (before: 58 ± 51%, after: 8 ± 29%, P = 0.03). Collectively, these results demonstrate that passive heat stress does not alter glomerular filtration rate. However, heat acclimation may improve urine concentrating ability and filtration within the glomerulus. This article is protected by copyright.

Cell fusion induced by hPIV-2 was inhibited by glycyrrhizin, and glycyrrhizin reduced the number of viruses released from the cells. Glycyrrhizin did not change cell morphology at 1 day of culture, but caused some damage at 4 days, as determined by the effect on actin microfilaments. However, it affected the cell viability at 1 day: about 20% of the cells were not alive by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay at 1 day of culture. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR showed that virus genome synthesis was largely inhibited. mRNA synthesis was also inhibited by glycyrrhizin. Viral protein synthesis was largely inhibited as observed by an indirect immunofluorescence study. Multinucleated giant cell formation was studied using a recombinant green fluorescence protein (GFP)-expressing hPIV-2 without matrix protein (rhPIV-2ΔMGFP). A few single cells with fluorescence were observed, but the formation of giant cells was completely blocked. Taken together, it was shown that viral genome, mRNA and protein syntheses, including F and HN proteins, were inhibited by glycyrrhizin, and consequently multinucleated giant cell formation was not observed and the infectious virus was not detected in the culture medium.","Sakai-Sugino, Kae; Uematsu, Jun; Kamada, Miyuki; Taniguchi, Hiroe; Suzuki, Saori; Yoshimi, Yumiko; Kihira, Sahoko; Yamamoto, Hidetaka; Kawano, Mitsuo; Tsurudome, Masato; O'Brien, Myles; Itoh, Makoto; Komada, Hiroshi",Drug discoveries & therapeutics,389,4

We studied the physiological effects of N95 FFR use in a cohort of gastroenterologists performing simulated colonoscopies. METHODS Data collection and comparisons included (1) symptoms and change in vital signs in 12 gastroenterologists performing simulated colonoscopy for 60 minutes while wearing a surgical mask (SM) and face-shield (FS); N95 FFR, SM and FS; and powered air purifying respirator (PAPR), and (2) respiratory belt plethysmography and continuous EKG frequency-based heart rate variability indices including very low frequency power (measures intracardiac sympathetic tone) and low frequency to high frequency ratios (intracardiac sympathetic to vagal ratio) in 11 gastroenterologists performing simulated colonoscopy while wearing a SM (15 minutes), N95 FFR and SM (60 minutes), and SM (15 minutes) in rapid sequence. RESULTS Ten of 12 (83%) gastroenterologists reported symptoms with N95 FFR use, most commonly breathing difficulty, frustration, fatigue, and headache. Nine (75%) of these gastroenterologists had associated significant heart rate elevation. Respiratory peak to trough measurement showed a significant increase (F(2)=7.543, p=0.004) during the N95 FFR stage, which resolved after removal of N95 FFR. Although not statistically different, all gastroenterologists showed a decrease in sympathetic to vagal ratio and an increase in intracardiac sympathetic effect in the N95 FFR stage. PAPR use was better tolerated but associated with headache and elevated heart rate in 4 (33%) gastroenterologists. CONCLUSIONS N95 FFR use by gastroenterologists is associated with development of acute physiological changes and symptoms.","Khalid, Asif; Romutis, Stephanie; Ibinson, Jonathan; Thomas, Christopher; Myint, Alex; Dueker, Jeffrey; Johnston, Elyse; Kreiss, Christianna; Kingsley, Michael; Skef, Wasseem; Vipperla, Kishore; McGrath, Kevin; Phillips, Anna Evans; Das, Rohit; Fasanella, Kenneth; Ibinson, James",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,389,16

This was demonstrated by the increased lipidation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), a hallmark of autophagy, and by the visualization of characteristic vesicles within infected cells. The response was detected first at 2 h postinfection and persisted for at least 3 days. De novo protein synthesis was not required for the effect, since HCMV that was irradiated with UV light also elicited the response, and furthermore the continuous presence of cycloheximide did not prevent induction. Infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) under conditions that inhibited viral gene expression provoked autophagy, whereas UV-irradiated respiratory syncytial virus did not. The induction of autophagy occurred when cells were infected with HCMV or HSV-1 that was gradient purified, but HCMV dense bodies and HSV-1 light particles, each of which lack nucleocapsids and genomes, were inactive. The depletion of regulatory proteins Atg5 and Atg7, which are required for autophagy, reduced LC3 modification in response to infection but did not result in any detectable difference in viral or cellular gene expression at early times after infection. The electroporation of DNA into HFFF2 cultures induced the lipidation of LC3 but double-stranded RNA did not, even though both agents stimulated an innate immune response. The results show a novel, early cellular response to the presence of the incoming virion and additionally demonstrate that autophagy can be induced by the presence of foreign DNA within cells.","McFarlane, Steven; Aitken, James; Sutherland, Jane S; Nicholl, Mary Jane; Preston, Valerie G; Preston, Chris M",Journal of virology,389,2

However, little is known regarding racial differences in postoperative outcomes. The primary aim of this study was to determine if 30-day complication rates following pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) differ by race. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent PD for PDAC from 2014 to 2016 within the ACS-NSQIP pancreatectomy-specific data set was performed. Primary outcomes were 30-day pancreas-specific and overall major complications. RESULTS A total of 6936 patients were identified, including 91.4% (N = 6337) White and 8.6% (N = 599) Black. Pathologic stage and rates of neoadjuvant therapy were similar among Whites and Blacks. Rates of pancreas-specific (23.9% vs. 23.1%, p = .88) and major postoperative complications (39.2% vs. 39.9%, p = .55) were similar between Whites and Blacks. By multivariable regression analysis, there was no association between race and odds of pancreas-specific complications (odds ratio [OR] 1.10, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89-1.37) or overall major complications (OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.95-1.36). CONCLUSIONS Among patients undergoing PD for PDAC, Black race is not associated with increased pancreas-specific or overall 30-day postoperative complications. Short-term postoperative outcomes do not appear to explain the increase in pancreatic cancer mortality among Black patients.","Mitsakos, Anastasios T; Dennis, Samuel O; Parikh, Alexander A; Snyder, Rebecca A",Journal of surgical oncology,389,12

Bovine babesiosis inflicted substantial cattle production losses in the United States before the vectors were eliminated by 1943, with the exception of a Permanent Quarantine Zone in South Texas, a buffer along the Mexico border where the invasive ixodids remain. As suitable hosts, infested white-tailed deer and nilgai antelope populations disperse R. annulatus and R. microplus, which increases the risk for emergence of bovine babesiosis in the United States. A R. microplus incursion first detected in 2016 on the South Texas coastal plain wildlife corridor involved infestations on cattle, nilgai antelope, white-tailed deer, and vegetation. Efforts at passive sampling of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) spp. on hosts are concentrated in the Permanent Quarantine Zone. Hence, a knowledge gap exists on the full extent of the recent incursions. Area-wide, systematic, active sampling and supportive research, involving the Permanent Quarantine Zone, Temporary Quarantine Zone, most of the coastal plain, and other parts of Texas outside of the quarantine zones, are needed to bridge the knowledge gap. Herein, we provide research perspectives and rationale to develop and implement systematic active sampling that will provide an increasingly accurate assessment of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) spp. distribution in Texas. We suggest that this is essential to advance integrated vector-borne animal disease eradication approaches for keeping cattle free of bovine babesiosis.","Showler, Allan T; Pérez de León, Adalberto; Saelao, Perot",Journal of medical entomology,389,9

We hypothesize that extra-intestinal cells can contribute to mucosal healing after injury to the small and large intestine. We generated parabiotic pairs between wild-type and tdTomato mice, which were then subjected to radiation-induced enteritis and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis. We now show that as compared with singleton mice, mice with a parabiotic partner were protected against intestinal damage as revealed by significantly reduced weight loss, reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduced enterocyte apoptosis, and improved crypt proliferation. Donor cells expressed CD45-, Sca-1+, c-kit+, and CXCR4+ and accumulated around the injured crypts but did not transdifferentiate into epithelia, suggesting that extra-intestinal cells play a paracrine role in the healing response, while parabiotic pairings with Rag1-/- mice showed improved healing, indicating that adaptive immune cells were dispensable for mucosal healing. Strikingly, ablation of the bone marrow of the donor parabionts removed the protective effects. These findings reveal that the recruitment of extra-intestinal, bone marrow-derived cells into the injured intestinal mucosa can promote mucosal healing, suggesting novel therapeutic approaches for severe intestinal disease.","Sung, J; Sodhi, C P; Voltaggio, L; Hou, X; Jia, H; Zhou, Q; Čiháková, D; Hackam, D J",Mucosal immunology,389,15

Adverse effects from suboptimal rewarming could diminish neuroprotection from hypothermia. Therefore, we tested whether rewarming is associated with apoptosis. Piglets underwent hypoxia-asphyxia followed by normothermic or hypothermic recovery at 2 hours. Hypothermic groups were divided into those with no rewarming, rewarming at 0.5 °C/hour, or rewarming at 4 °C/hour. Neurodegeneration at 29 hours was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining, TUNEL assay, and immunoblotting for cleaved caspase-3. Rewarmed piglets had more apoptosis in motor cortex than did those that remained hypothermic after hypoxia-asphyxia. Apoptosis in piriform cortex was greater in hypoxic-asphyxic, rewarmed piglets than in naive/sham piglets. Caspase-3 inhibitor suppressed apoptosis with rewarming. Rapidly rewarmed piglets had more caspase-3 cleavage in cerebral cortex than did piglets that remained hypothermic or piglets that were rewarmed slowly. We conclude that rewarming from therapeutic hypothermia can adversely affect the newborn brain by inducing apoptosis through caspase mechanisms.","Wang, Bing; Armstrong, Jillian S; Lee, Jeong-Hoo; Bhalala, Utpal; Kulikowicz, Ewa; Zhang, Hui; Reyes, Michael; Moy, Nicole; Spicer, Dawn; Zhu, Junchao; Yang, Zeng-Jin; Koehler, Raymond C; Martin, Lee J; Lee, Jennifer K",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,389,1

The risks of transmission of infection are greater when a patient is undergoing an aerosol-generating procedure (AGP). Not all those with COVID-19 infection are symptomatic, or suspected of harbouring the infection. If a patient who is not known to have or suspected of having COVID-19 infection is to undergo an AGP, it would nonetheless be sensible to minimise the risk to those HCWs treating them. If the mouth and nose of an individual undergoing an AGP are irrigated with antimicrobial solutions, this may be a simple and safe method of reducing the risk of any covert infection being passed to HCWs through droplet transmission or direct contact. Alternatively, the use of antimicrobial solutions by the HCW may decrease the chance of them acquiring COVID-19 infection. However, the use of such antimicrobial solutions may be associated with harms related to the toxicity of the solutions themselves or alterations in the natural microbial flora of the mouth or nose. OBJECTIVES To assess the benefits and harms of antimicrobial mouthwashes and nasal sprays administered to HCWs and/or patients when undertaking AGPs on patients without suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. SEARCH METHODS Information Specialists from Cochrane ENT and Cochrane Oral Health searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2020, Issue 6); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 June 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: This is a question that urgently requires evidence, however at the present time we did not anticipate finding many completed RCTs. We therefore planned to include the following types of studies: randomised controlled trials (RCTs); quasi-RCTs; non-randomised controlled trials; prospective cohort studies; retrospective cohort studies; cross-sectional studies; controlled before-and-after studies. We set no minimum duration for the studies. We sought studies comparing any antimicrobial mouthwash and/or nasal spray (alone or in combination) at any concentration, delivered to the patient or HCW before and/or after an AGP. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were: 1) incidence of symptomatic or test-positive COVID-19 infection in HCWs or patients; 2) significant adverse event: anosmia (or disturbance in sense of smell). Our secondary outcomes were: 3) COVID-19 viral content of aerosol (when present); 4) change in COVID-19 viral load at site(s) of irrigation; 5) other adverse events: changes in microbiome in oral cavity, nasal cavity, oro- or nasopharynx; 6) other adverse events: allergy, irritation/burning of nasal, oral or oropharyngeal mucosa (e.g. erosions, ulcers, bleeding), long-term staining of mucous membranes or teeth, accidental ingestion. We planned to use GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS We found no completed studies to include in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We identified no studies for inclusion in this review, nor any ongoing studies.

This trial was undertaken to study the efficacy and safety profile of topical nasal administration of CQN drops in reducing viral load and preventing clinical progression in early COVID-19 infection. Methods : This randomized clinical trial was done with a sample size of 60. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed asymptomatic patients or those with mild COVID-19 illness [National Early Warning Score (NEWS) =4] were included. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 manner. Control arm (standard supportive treatment, n=30) was compared with intervention arm (n=30) of standard treatment plus CQN eye drops (0.03%) repurposed as nasal drops administered six times daily (0.5 ml/dose) for 10 days. Outcome measures were adverse events and adherence; clinical progression and outcomes were measured by NEWS; sequential RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were also noted on days 0, 3, 7 and 10. Results : Nasal CQN was associated with local irritation in seven and non-compliance in one of 30 patients. Eleven patients were excluded due to enrolment error (2 - recovered; 9 - false-positive referral), and 49 patients were analyzed as per modified intention-to-treat analysis. Clinical recovery was noted as similar with 100 per cent asymptomatic by day seven in both arms. Virological outcomes also indicated similarly improving Ct values in both arms, and similar proportion of patients transitioning to non-infectivity by day 10 (controls - 19/25; nasal CQN - 15/24). Nine false-positive patients with enrolment error and day 0 RT-PCR negative were initially uninfected but had continuing COVID-19 exposure and treatment as per randomization. Patients receiving nasal CQN (n=5) demonstrated stable Ct values from day 0 to 10, while patients with no nasal CQN (n=4) demonstrated significant dip in Ct value indicating to infection (Ct< 35) and infectivity (Ct< 33). Interpretation & conclusions : The present study suggests to the potential of topical nasal CQN in the prevention of COVID-19 infection if administered before the infection is established. No significant differences in clinical or virological outcome were however, demonstrated in patients with mild but established illness.","Thakar, Alok; Panda, Smriti; Sakthivel, Pirabu; Brijwal, Megha; Dhakad, Shivram; Choudekar, Avinash; Kanodia, Anupam; Bhatnagar, Sushma; Mohan, Anant; Maulik, Subir K; Dar, Lalit",The Indian journal of medical research,389,1

This study was undertaken to assess the feasibility and efficacy of transplanting autogenous scaffold-free culture-expanded mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) sheets to the buccal alveolar bone surface to stimulate local bone growth. MATERIAL AND METHODS Mandibular bone marrow was aspirated from 3-month-old pigs (n = 5), from which MSCs were isolated and culture expanded. Triple-layer MSC sheets were then fabricated using temperature-responsive tissue culture plates. One month after bone marrow aspirations, the same pigs underwent bilateral extraction of mandibular primary molars, immediately followed by transplantation of 3 autogenous triple-layer MSC sheets on to the subperiosteal buccal alveolar surface of 1 randomly chosen side. The contralateral side (control) underwent the same periosteal reflection surgery without receiving MSC sheet transplantation. Six weeks later, the animals were killed and specimens from both sides were immediately harvested for radiographic and histological analysis. Buccal alveolar bone thickness, tissue mineral density (TMD), mineral apposition and bone volume fraction (BV/TV) were quantified and compared between the MSC sheet and control sides using paired t-tests. RESULTS Triple-layer MSC sheets were reliably fabricated and the majority of cells remained vital before transplantation. The thickness of buccal bone tended to increase with MSC sheet transplantation (P = .18), with 4 of 5 animals showing an average of 1.82 ± 0.73 mm thicker bone on the MSC sheet side than the control side. After being normalized by the TMD of intracortical bone, the TMD of surface cortical bone was 0.5-fold higher on the MSC sheet side than the control side (P < .05). Likewise, the BV/TV measurements of the buccal surface region were also 0.4-fold higher on the MSC sheet side than the control side (P < .05) after being normalized by measurements from the intracortical region. Mineral apposition measurements were not different between the 2 sides. CONCLUSION Mandibular marrow-derived MSCs can be fabricated into cell sheets and autogenous transplantation of MSC sheets onto the subperiosteal buccal alveolar bone surface at the tooth-extraction site may increase local bone density.","Mu, S; Tee, B C; Emam, H; Zhou, Y; Sun, Z",Journal of periodontal research,389,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study included patients with HNC who had undergone CT-guided percutaneous gastrostomy between February 2007 and December 2013. Information regarding the patients' backgrounds, CT-guided percutaneous gastrostomy techniques, technical success rate, and AEs were obtained from the medical records. In all patients, the stomach was punctured under CT fluoroscopy with a Funada gastropexy device. RESULTS During the study period, 177 patients underwent CT-guided percutaneous gastrostomy. The most common tumor location was the oral cavity, followed by the pharynx and maxilla. The indication for CT-guided percutaneous gastrostomy were tumor obstruction in 78 patients, postoperative dysphagia in 55 patients, radiation edema in 43 patients, and cerebral infarction in 1 patient. The technical success rate was 97.7 %. The overall mean procedure time was 25.3 min. Major AEs occurred in seven patients (4.0 %), including bleeding (n = 4), colonic injury (n = 1), gastric tear (n = 1), and aspiration pneumonia (n = 1). Minor AEs occurred in 15 patients (8.5 %), which included peristomal leakage (n = 6), irritation (n = 4), inadvertent removal (n = 2), peristomal hemorrhage (n = 1), peristomal infection (n = 1), and wound granulation (n = 1). The mean follow-up period was 111 days (range 1-1106 days).

Although the mortality rate is < 1% among the general population, pregnant women can have a fatality rate of up to 30%. Additionally, chronic hepatitis E has increasingly become a significant clinical problem in immunocompromised individuals. Effective antivirals against HEV are needed. AREAS COVERED This review article addresses the current state of knowledge of HEV infections with regard to animal and cell culture model systems that are important for antiviral discovery and testing, our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of virus replication, our understanding of how each viral protein functions, and areas that can potentially be exploited as therapeutic targets. EXPERT OPINION Lack of an efficient cell culture system for HEV propagation, the limited knowledge of HEV lifecycle, and the inherent self-limiting infection within the normal populace make the development of new therapeutic agents against HEV challenging. There are many promising therapeutic targets, and the tools for identifying and testing potential antivirals are rapidly evolving. The development of effective therapeutics against HEV in immunocompromised and pregnant patient populations is warranted.","Kenney, Scott P; Meng, Xiang-Jin",Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,389,13

METHODS In this randomised cross-over trial, we recruited neonates of gestation >24 weeks. Consented infants were randomly assigned to either pulse oximeter sensor with opaque wrap or without opaque wrap. Nellcor and Masimo sensors were applied simultaneously to different feet for 10 min of recording. Infants were crossed over to the other intervention for a further 10 min, totalling 20 min recording per infant. Primary outcome was faster acquisition of data with shielding of pulse oximeter sensor as compared with not shielding. RESULTS A total of 96 babies were recruited. There was no difference in primary outcome of time taken to display valid data between the two groups (opaque wrap: 12.73±3.1 s vs no opaque wrap: 13.16±3.3 s, p=0.27). There was no difference in any of the secondary outcomes (percentage of valid data points, percentage of time saturation below target, and so on) between the two groups in both pulse oximeters.

This study aimed to describe the initial clinical experience of NOTES-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (NAVH) and to investigate its feasibility and surgical outcomes compared with single-port laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (SP-LAVH). DESIGN Retrospective chart analysis (Canadian Task Force classification II-1). SETTING One university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS Women undergoing NAVH or SP-LAVH for benign uterine diseases. INTERVENTION NAVH using a novel homemade NOTES system comprised a glove-wound retractor NOTES port or SP-LAVH using conventional laparoscopic instruments and an umbilical glove port. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Since July 2012, 16 patients with benign uterine disease have undergone NAVH. Another 32 paired, SP-LAVH patients from the registered database were used to compare these 2 modalities of laparoscopic-assisted techniques for vaginal hysterectomy. All NAVHs were completed successfully without the need of an additional port or conversion to the standard laparoscopic approach. Intraoperative and postoperative surgical outcomes were assessed in both groups of patients. There was also no significant difference between both groups in perioperative outcomes such as estimated blood loss, decrease in hemoglobin on postoperative day 1, amount of analgesic drugs used, postoperative visual analog scale pain score, and febrile complications, except for operative time and length of postoperative hospital stay. The mean operative time was 70.6 ± 12.8 minutes for NAVH and 93.2 ± 21.4 minutes for SP-LAVH (p < .001). The median postoperative hospital stay was 3.5 days (range, 3-5) for NAVH and 4 days (range, 3-6) for SP-LAVH (p < .001). CONCLUSION The findings show that NAVH is a feasible and safe surgical technique and has a short operative time and postoperative hospital stay compared with SP-LAVH. This new technique at least offers similar surgical outcomes and superior cosmesis in our opinion compared with SP-LAVH. However, prospective studies are needed to determine its full clinical application.","Yang, Yun Seok; Kim, Soo Young; Hur, Myung Haeng; Oh, Kwoan Young",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,389,31

Physician burnout occurs due to demanding hours and psychological conditions unique to the field. Programs that address overall well-being early in residency are necessary to prevent physician burnout and promote physician mental health. OBJECTIVE To determine the impact of a wellness initiative on anxiety, depression, quality of life, and sleepiness among the resident participants. METHODS A wellness program was initiated and available to resident physicians in the Medical University of South Carolina Department of Neurosurgery. Participants attended weekly group workout sessions with biweekly lectures on mental health and sleep hygiene. Eight resident participants underwent baseline and final psychological testing in July 2015 and June 2016 including the Personal Health Questionnaire Depression Scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale, the Quality of Life Scale, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Participant perceptions of the program were also assessed with an anonymous survey. RESULTS At the conclusion of the pilot year, improvements were observed in anxiety scores (4 to 2.1; P = .039), quality-of-life scores (82.4 to 95.4; P = .007), and sleepiness (8.3 to 5.7; P = .019). In general, resident perceptions of the program were favorable. CONCLUSION Residency-incorporated wellness programs are achievable and can benefit resident mental health. Lack of a control group limits the interpretation of the results. Programs such as these may be implemented to promote well-being and combat physician burnout and its associated mental health abnormalities.","Spiotta, Alejandro M; Fargen, Kyle M; Patel, Sunil; Larrew, Thomas; Turner, Raymond D",Neurosurgery,389,30

Previous studies with MRI-visible mesh implants in different parts of the abdominal wall have led to variable findings with regard to mesh properties and mostly described a reduction in size over time with subsequently limited mesh overlap over hernia defects which could contribute to recurrence. We aimed to evaluate implant properties in a mechanically stable anatomical region after TAPP repair of primary unilateral inguinal hernias in men with clinical and MRI examinations 4 weeks and 1 year after surgery. METHODS From 11/2015 to 01/2019, 23 men with primary, unilateral, inguinal hernias underwent TAPP repair with iron particle-loaded, MRI-visible mesh implants in a prospective cohort study. In 16 patients the operative outcome could be evaluated 4 weeks and 12 months after surgery by clinical examination and MRI evaluation with regard to postoperative course, possible adverse outcomes and radiological findings related to implant behavior-namely MRI-identifiability, mesh dislocation or reduction in surface area. RESULTS All included patients had an uneventful postoperative clinical course. MRI after 4 weeks revealed one postoperative seroma, which resolved spontaneously. No recurrence was detected. Mesh implants could be accurately delineated in DIXON-IN studies and showed neither clinically nor statistically significant changes in size or position. CONCLUSION 4 weeks and 1 year after a standardized TAPP procedure the mesh implant used in this study showed no tendency towards dislocation or reduction in size in this anatomical position. Its MRI visibility allows accurate delineation during the postoperative course by experienced radiologists in appropriate MRI protocols. Larger patient series are desirable to further support these findings. Shrinkage of implants in the groin as a reason for early recurrence may be overestimated.","Lechner, M; Meissnitzer, M; Borhanian, K; Bittner, R; Kaufmann, R; Mayer, F; Jäger, T; Mitterwallner, S; Emmanuel, K; Forstner, R",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,389,31

We investigated the immediate consequences of such a lockdown for patients with heart failure (HF). METHODS Using the Danish nationwide administrative databases, we investigated the incidence of new-onset HF and hospitalizations for worsening HF before and after the lockdown (January 1 to March 11 versus March 12 to March 31) in 2020 versus 2019. We also investigated the mortality for all patients with HF and in COVID-19-infected patients with HF. RESULTS Rates of new-onset HF between January 1 and March 11 were comparable for 2020 and 2019 (1.83 versus 1.78 per 10 000 person-years; P=0.19), while hospitalizations for worsening HF were slightly higher in 2020 versus 2019 (1.04 versus 0.93 per 1000 person-years; P=0.02). In the lockdown period, rates of new-onset HF diagnoses (1.26 versus 2.25 per 1000 person-years) and of hospitalizations for worsening HF (0.63 versus 0.99 per 1000 person-years) were significantly lower in 2020 versus 2019 (P for both, <0.0001). Mortality was similar before and after the national lockdown for the population with HF. We observed 90 HF patients with diagnosed COVID-19 infection, of whom 37% (95% CI, 23%-50%) died within 15 days. CONCLUSIONS The number of patients hospitalized with worsening HF or diagnosed with new-onset HF was markedly reduced after lockdown but has not yet impacted mortality in HF patients at a population-based level. However, these data raise concerns for a potential undertreatment of HF currently that may impact prognosis in the longer term.","Andersson, Charlotte; Gerds, Thomas; Fosbøl, Emil; Phelps, Matthew; Andersen, Julie; Lamberts, Morten; Holt, Anders; Butt, Jawad H; Madelaire, Christian; Gislason, Gunnar; Torp-Pedersen, Christian; Køber, Lars; Schou, Morten",Circulation.

This study provides a detailed analysis of outcomes of a large ESUS population. METHODS Data set was derived from the Athens Stroke Registry. ESUS was defined according to the Cryptogenic Stroke/ESUS International Working Group criteria. End points were mortality, stroke recurrence, functional outcome, and a composite cardiovascular end point comprising recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, aortic aneurysm rupture, systemic embolism, or sudden cardiac death. We performed Kaplan-Meier analyses to estimate cumulative probabilities of outcomes by stroke type and Cox-regression to investigate whether stroke type was outcome predictor. RESULTS 2731 patients were followed-up for a mean of 30.5±24.1months. There were 73 (26.5%) deaths, 60 (21.8%) recurrences, and 78 (28.4%) composite cardiovascular end points in the 275 ESUS patients. The cumulative probability of survival in ESUS was 65.6% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 58.9%-72.2%), significantly higher compared with cardioembolic stroke (38.8%, 95% CI, 34.9%-42.7%). The cumulative probability of stroke recurrence in ESUS was 29.0% (95% CI, 22.3%-35.7%), similar to cardioembolic strokes (26.8%, 95% CI, 22.1%-31.5%), but significantly higher compared with all types of noncardioembolic stroke. One hundred seventy-two (62.5%) ESUS patients had favorable functional outcome compared with 280 (32.2%) in cardioembolic and 303 (60.9%) in large-artery atherosclerotic. ESUS patients had similar risk of composite cardiovascular end point as all other stroke types, with the exception of lacunar strokes, which had significantly lower risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.52-0.94]).

In this regard, intravascular photoacoustic (IVPA) imaging is an emerging plaque detection modality that provides lipid-specific chemical information of arterial walls. Within the near-infrared window, a 1210-nm optical source is usually chosen for IVPA applications because lipid exhibits a strong absorption peak at that wavelength. However, other arterial tissues also show some degree of absorption near 1210 nm and generate undesirable interfering PA signals. In this study, a novel wavelength-modulated Intravascular Differential Photoacoustic Radar (IV-DPAR) modality was introduced as an interference-free detection technique for a more accurate and reliable diagnosis of plaque progression. By using two low-power continuous-wave laser diodes in a differential manner, IV-DPAR could efficiently suppress undesirable absorptions and system noise, while dramatically improving system sensitivity and specificity to cholesterol, the primary ingredient of plaque necrotic core. When co-registered with intravascular ultrasound imaging, IV-DPAR could sensitively locate and characterize the lipid contents of plaques in human atherosclerotic arteries, regardless of their size and depth.","Choi, Sung Soo Sean; Lashkari, Bahman; Mandelis, Andreas; Weyers, Jill J; Boyes, Aaron; Foster, Stuart F; Alves-Kotzev, Natasha; Courtney, Brian",Scientific reports,389,1

Investigating the benefits of minimally invasive RAPN including faster convalescence and decreased postoperative narcotic use make this an attractive option in patients with advanced age and numerous comorbidities. METHODS A retrospective review of 250 consecutive patients who underwent robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) for a solitary renal tumor from June 2006 to May 2010 at our institution was performed. Thirty-seven patients ≥ 70 years (G70) who underwent 38 robotic partial nephrectomy (RPN) procedures were identified. This group was matched with 38 patients <70 years (L70) who underwent 38 RPN procedures at our institution. Functional, perioperative, and oncological outcomes of RAPN in patients ≥ 70 years old were analyzed. RESULTS Overall, the median tumor size was 2.65 cm. Tumor characteristics, renal function, nephrometry score, and incidence of renal cancer in lesions were similar between the L70 and G70 groups. The two groups showed no differences in American Society of Anesthesiologists scores of 1-4 or Charlson comorbidity index score. Perioperative and postoperative outcomes showed no variation between L70 and G70 patients. Postoperative complications rate of 21% and 31.6% in the L70 and G70 groups, respectively, showed no difference (P < .48). There were 5 deaths, 3 of which occurred in the G70 group (8.1%) at a median of 22 months after surgery.

The additive value of PRP; however, remains elusive. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is released from activated platelets with a capacity for stimulating melanocyte proliferation and migration. We aimed to assess the treatment outcomes for the mini punch grafting (MPG) / phototherapy treatment with and without PRP and to evaluate the relation between bFGF and the obtained results. Thirty-four vitiliginous patches, two per each patient with stable vitiligo, were enrolled in this intra-patient-controlled study and treated with autologous MPG and subsequent exposure to phototherapy with and without enhancement via PRP procedure at the time of the procedure, and monthly for the subsequent 3 months. Re-pigmentation assessment via vitiligo scores as well as measurement of lesional bFGF were done. PRP assistance to MPG/phototherapy treatment resulted in earlier re-pigmentation at week 8. However, this enhancement effect vanished at the study end (week 20) as ideal re-pigmentation (> 75% re-pigmentation) was encountered in 10 patches (58.8%) treated with MPG/phototherapy modality, and in 12 patches (70.6%) treated with PRP-assisted method without significant difference between them. Lesional bFGF increased after both treatments with a higher expression with PRP assistance but without clinical reflection on the final outcome. PRP can speed the re-pigmentation response for MPG/phototherapy procedure without any significant effect on the final outcome.","Salem, Samar Abdallah M; Fezeaa, Tabarek Abdulkhaleq; El Khazragy, Nashwa; Soltan, Marwa Y",Dermatologic therapy,389,14

Tier 3 weight management programmes support patients with complex obesity and traditionally offer interventions through face-to-face delivery. In this study, a service evaluation compared weight loss for adults with a BMI ≥ 45 kg/m2 or ≥ 40 kg/m2 with a comorbidity, who were offered a non-randomized dietetic intervention through face-to-face, telephone, or digital support using the Oviva smartphone app as part of a tier 3 weight management programme. One hundred and sixty-nine patients commenced the core programme. There were no significant differences in weight loss between patients receiving face-to-face (5.3 ± 5.5 kg [-4.1%]), telephone (-4 ± 5.3 kg [-3.4%]) and digital support (-6.1 ± 4.9 kg [-4.5%]) (P = .061), with data reported as intention-to-treat using baseline observation carried forward imputation. Completer data were also analysed at an optional 12-week follow-up where weight loss was maintained with no significant differences between face-to-face (-7.6 ± 9.3 kg [-5.6%]) and digital support (-9.2 ± 7.6) kg [-6.8%]) (P = .135). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the acceptability of the interventions (P = .261). Due to the potential scalability, resource, and cost-savings of digital care, and improvement in accessibility for some people, digital delivery of weight management programmes should be considered as a care option in weight management services.","Huntriss, Rosemary; Haines, Matthew; Jones, Lucy; Mulligan, Danielle",Clinical obesity,389,26

Although ACC is more often superficial and small, it can be large and involve the underlying structures such as skull and dura, thus increasing the risk of hemorrhage, infection, and mortality. Controversy exists regarding nonsurgical versus surgical intervention for this condition. This study reviews indications and modalities for treatment of this rare congenital anomaly. RESULTS Management of this anomaly depends on size, location, and structures at risk. Small lesions with intact underlying structures and lesions affecting extremities are treated in a conservative fashion with dressings and ointments followed by delayed scar excision. Aplasia cutis congenita scar excision often requires complex tissue rearrangement, tissue expansion, or skin grafting. Larger ACC lesions or lesions with exposure of vital structures require early surgical intervention. Initially, exposed vital structures and bony ridges can be protected using conservative measures. Delayed definitive repair can then be performed using scalp flaps, split- and full-thickness skin grafts, cultured epithelial autografts, delayed split rib cranioplasty, tissue expansion, and composite cranioplasty. CONCLUSIONS Aplasia cutis congenita should be individually evaluated based on size, depth, location, and tissues involved. Using conservative and surgical modalities, one can achieve complete closure of the defect, thus avoiding risks of infection, hemorrhage, and further trauma.","Bharti, Gaurav; Groves, Leslie; David, Lisa R; Sanger, Claire; Argenta, Louis C",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,389,20

Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for SARS-CoV-2, the identity of any intermediate host that might have facilitated transfer to humans is unknown. Here, we report the identification of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin-associated coronaviruses that belong to two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses, including one that exhibits strong similarity to SARS-CoV-2 in the receptor-binding domain. The discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to SARS-CoV-2 suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible hosts in the emergence of novel coronaviruses and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.","Lam, Tommy Tsan-Yuk; Shum, Marcus Ho-Hin; Zhu, Hua-Chen; Tong, Yi-Gang; Ni, Xue-Bing; Liao, Yun-Shi; Wei, Wei; Cheung, William Yiu-Man; Li, Wen-Juan; Li, Lian-Feng; Leung, Gabriel M; Holmes, Edward C; Hu, Yan-Ling; Guan, Yi",Nature,389,1

Delivering COVID-19 treatment services in crisis settings will likely entail complex trade-offs between offering services of clinical benefit and minimising risks of nosocomial infection, while allocating resources appropriately and safeguarding other essential services. This paper outlines considerations for humanitarian actors planning COVID-19 treatment services where vaccination is not yet widely available. We suggest key decision-making considerations: allocation of resources to COVID-19 treatment services and the design of clinical services should be based on community preferences, likely opportunity costs, and a clearly articulated package of care across different health system levels. Moreover, appropriate service planning requires information on the expected COVID-19 burden and the resilience of the health system. We explore COVID-19 treatment service options at the patient level (diagnosis, management, location and level of treatment) and measures to reduce nosocomial transmission (cohorting patients, protecting healthcare workers). Lastly, we propose key indicators for monitoring COVID-19 health services.","Garry, Sylvia; Abdelmagid, Nada; Baxter, Louisa; Roberts, Natalie; le Polain de Waroux, Olivier; Ismail, Sharif; Ratnayake, Ruwan; Favas, Caroline; Lewis, Elizabeth; Checchi, Francesco",Conflict and health,389,1

Stent-assisted coiling and balloon-assisted coiling are alternative techniques to treat such complex aneurysms, but studies have shown less-than-expected efficacy, as suggested by their high rate of recanalization. The management of complex aneurysms via microsurgery or conventional neuroendovascular strategies has traditionally been poor. However, over the last few years, flow-diverting stents (FDS) have revolutionized the treatment of such aneurysms. FDS are implanted within the parent artery rather than the aneurysm sac. By modifying intra-aneurysmal and parent-vessel flow dynamics at the aneurysm/parent vessel interface, FDS trigger a cascade of gradual intra-aneurysmal thrombosis. As endothelialization of the FDS is complete, the parent vessel reconstructs while preserving the patency of normal perforators and side branch vessels. As with any intervention, the practice and application of flow-diversion technology is inherent, with risks that include vessel rupture or perforation, in-stent thrombosis, perforator occlusion, procedural and delayed hemorrhages, and perianeurysmal edema. Herein, we review the devices, their mechanisms of actions, clinical applications, complications, and ongoing studies.","Al-Mufti, Fawaz; Amuluru, Krishna; Gandhi, Chirag D; Prestigiacomo, Charles J",Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics,389,1

We investigated involvement of other BMPs in preventing haemochromatosis and subsequent osteopenia in Bmp6-/- mice. METHODS Iron-treated wild-type (WT) and Bmp6-/- mice were analysed for hepcidin messenger RNA (mRNA) and tissue and blood BMP levels by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and proximity extension assay. BMPs labeled with technetium-99m were used in pharmacokinetic studies. RESULTS In WT mice, 4 h following iron challenge, liver Bmp6 and hepcidin expression were increased, while expression of other Bmps was not affected. In parallel, we provided the first evidence that BMP6 circulates in WT mice and that iron increased the BMP6 serum level and the specific liver uptake of (99m)Tc-BMP6. In Bmp6-/- mice, iron challenge led to blunted activation of liver Smad signaling and hepcidin expression with a delay of 24 h, associated with increased Bmp5 and Bmp7 expression and increased Bmp2, 4, 5 and 9 expression in the duodenum. Liver Bmp7 expression and increased circulating BMP9 eventually contributed to the late hepcidin response. This was further supported by exogenous BMP7 therapy resulting in an effective hepcidin expression followed by a rapid normalisation of plasma iron values and restored osteopenia in Bmp6-/- mice. CONCLUSION In Bmp6-/- mice, iron activated endogenous compensatory mechanisms of other BMPs that were not sufficient for preventing hemochromatosis and bone loss. Administration of exogenous BMP7 was effective in correcting the plasma iron level and bone loss, indicating that BMP6 is an essential but not exclusive in vivo regulator of iron homeostasis.","Pauk, Martina; Grgurevic, Lovorka; Brkljacic, Jelena; Kufner, Vera; Bordukalo-Niksic, Tatjana; Grabusic, Kristina; Razdorov, Genadij; Rogic, Dunja; Zuvic, Marijan; Oppermann, Hermann; Babitt, Jodie L; Lin, Herbert Y; Volarevic, Sinisa; Vukicevic, Slobodan",International orthopaedics,389,1

We previously determined that a large springtime increase in solar insolation at the onset location was associated with a younger age of onset of bipolar disorder, especially with a family history of mood disorders. This study investigated whether the hours of daylight at the birth location affected this association. METHODS Data collected previously at 36 collection sites from 23 countries were available for 3896 patients with bipolar I disorder, born between latitudes of 1.4 N and 70.7 N, and 1.2 S and 41.3 S. Hours of daylight variables for the birth location were added to a base model to assess the relation between the age of onset and solar insolation. RESULTS More hours of daylight at the birth location during early life was associated with an older age of onset, suggesting reduced vulnerability to the future circadian challenge of the springtime increase in solar insolation at the onset location. Addition of the minimum of the average monthly hours of daylight during the first 3 months of life improved the base model, with a significant positive relationship to age of onset. Coefficients for all other variables remained stable, significant and consistent with the base model. CONCLUSIONS Light exposure during early life may have important consequences for those who are susceptible to bipolar disorder, especially at latitudes with little natural light in winter. This study indirectly supports the concept that early life exposure to light may affect the long term adaptability to respond to a circadian challenge later in life.","Bauer, Michael; Glenn, Tasha; Alda, Martin; Andreassen, Ole A; Angelopoulos, Elias; Ardau, Raffaella; Baethge, Christopher; Bauer, Rita; Baune, Bernhard T; Bellivier, Frank; Belmaker, Robert H; Berk, Michael; Bjella, Thomas D; Bossini, Letizia; Bersudsky, Yuly; Wo Cheung, Eric Yat; Conell, Jörn; Del Zompo, Maria; Dodd, Seetal; Etain, Bruno; Fagiolini, Andrea; Frye, Mark A; Fountoulakis, Kostas N; Garneau-Fournier, Jade; Gonzalez-Pinto, Ana; Gottlieb, John F; Harima, Hirohiko; Hassel, Stefanie; Henry, Chantal; Iacovides, Apostolos; Isometsä, Erkki T; Kapczinski, Flávio; Kliwicki, Sebastian; König, Barbara; Krogh, Rikke; Kunz, Mauricio; Lafer, Beny; Larsen, Erik R; Lewitzka, Ute; Lopez-Jaramillo, Carlos; MacQueen, Glenda; Manchia, Mirko; Marsh, Wendy; Martinez-Cengotitabengoa, Mónica; Melle, Ingrid; Monteith, Scott; Morken, Gunnar; Munoz, Rodrigo; Nery, Fabiano G; O'Donovan, Claire; Osher, Yamima; Pfennig, Andrea; Quiroz, Danilo; Ramesar, Raj; Rasgon, Natalie; Reif, Andreas; Ritter, Philipp; Rybakowski, Janusz K; Sagduyu, Kemal; Miranda-Scippa, Ângela; Severus, Emanuel; Simhandl, Christian; Stein, Dan J; Strejilevich, Sergio; Sulaiman, Ahmad Hatim; Suominen, Kirsi; Tagata, Hiromi; Tatebayashi, Yoshitaka; Torrent, Carla; Vieta, Eduard; Viswanath, Biju; Wanchoo, Mihir J; Zetin, Mark; Whybrow, Peter C",Journal of psychiatric research,389,6

A preferential urea pharmacophore that improved the binding properties of the compounds was identified for those series via biochemical assay in vitro and in vivo studies. Molecular docking displayed that 3,5-dimethyl on the adamantyl group in B401 could make van der Waals interactions with residues at a hydrophobic pocket of sEH active site, which might indirectly explain the subnanomolar level activities of memantyl urea derivatives in vitro better than AR-9281. Among them, compound B401 significantly improved the inhibition potency with human and murine sEH IC50 values as 0.4 nM and 0.5 nM, respectively.

The purely endoscopic endonasal extended transsphenoidal approach offers a direct midline trajectory and immediate access to tuberculum sellae meningiomas without brain retraction and manipulation of neurovascular structures. Although the endoscopic approach has been previously criticized for its inability to remove tumor within the optic canals, complete Simpson Grade I tumor removal including intracanalicular tumor, dural attachment, and involved hyperostotic bone can be achieved in properly selected patients. Excellent visualization of the suprasellar region and the inferomedial aspects of both optic canals allows for extracapsular, extraarachnoid dissection of the tumor from the critical structures using bimanual microsurgical dissection. In this report, the authors describe the operative nuances for removal of tuberculum sellae meningiomas with optic canal involvement using a purely endoscopic endonasal extended transsphenoidal (transplanum transtuberculum) approach. They specifically highlight the technique for endonasal bilateral optic nerve decompression and removal of intracanalicular tumor to improve postoperative visual function, as demonstrated in 2 illustrative cases. Special attention is also given to cranial base reconstruction to prevent CSF leakage using the vascularized pedicled nasoseptal flap.","Liu, James K; Christiano, Lana D; Patel, Smruti K; Tubbs, R Shane; Eloy, Jean Anderson",Neurosurgical focus,389,1

COVID-19 also has an unneglected effect on migraine patients. Migraine attack frequency as one of migraine characteristics, its impact during COVID-19 deserves further research. We aimed to evaluate whether migraine attack frequency during COVID-19 pandemic differed from pre-COVID-19, and explore their possible influencing factors during the pandemic. METHOD This prospective cohort study enrolled 187 migraine patients who came from the Department of Neurology of West China Hospital from October 2019 to December 2019. After inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 157 patients were included. We collected demographic data, clinical characteristics and epidemiological contact information and followed up on March 2020. Then Paired-Samples T test, logistic regression and interaction tests were used to analyze data. RESULT We found that value of migraine attack frequency was 2.47 ± 1.12 before and 3.54 ± 1.79 during COVID-19 (P<0.0001). Then we divided patients into two group based on the difference of migraine attack frequency between COVID-19 period and pre-COVID-19 and employed logistic regression analysis. In the logistic regression analysis, divorced status (OR=6.53, P=0.0453), good sleep pre-COVID-19 and poor sleep during COVID-19 (OR=3.11, P=0.0432) had independent effect on migraine attack frequency during COVID-19 pandemic. And we found no interaction in the poor sleep during COVID-19 between various subgroups. CONCLUSION Migraineurs may suffer from more frequent migraine attack during COVID-19 pandemic. Pay more attention to marital status and assessment of sleep status may contribute to adjusting suitable treatment strategies of migraine patients during pandemic.","Ma, Mengmeng; Bao, Jiajia; Fang, Jinghuan; Li, Changling; Li, Yanbo; Ge, Wenjing; Zhang, Yang; Guo, Jian; He, Li",Current neurovascular research,389,8

Although the benefit of conducting AWV is proven, its adoption in primary care is far from universal. The COVID-19 pandemic affected medical education and clinical care in unprecedented ways. Telehealth became a prominent way of delivering healthcare. Older adults, being significantly affected by the pandemic-related mortality and morbidity, were less likely to engage in preventive care with their healthcare providers. Amidst this considerable shift, we conceptualized a clinical experience for third-year medical students during their Ambulatory Care - Geriatrics clerkship that involved a telehealth interaction with an older adult to review AWV components, followed by an in-person office visit with the geriatrician preceptor. Post-session survey data highlighted the beneficial effect on student learning about older adult health maintenance, immunizations and geriatric syndrome assessment. It also facilitated self-directed learning and increased student-patient rapport. Preceptors appreciated the additional elements of care identified by the telehealth call that would otherwise not have been addressed in a time-limited office visit. This hybrid clinical experience reduced crowding in ambulatory clinical space during the COVID-19 pandemic, yet enhanced learning for students in geriatrics preventive care.","Rodriguez, Vanessa; Rivera, Veronica; Goldhirsch, Suzanne; Ramaswamy, Ravishankar",Gerontology & geriatrics education,389,28

A mean of 5.5 different viruses were shed in diarrhoeic piglets, and one piglet was in fact co-infected with 11 different viruses. By contrast, healthy piglets shed a mean of 3.2 different viruses. Compared with samples from healthy piglets, the co-infection of PEDV and PBoV had a high prevalence rate in diarrhoea samples, suggesting a correlation with the appearance of diarrhoea in piglets. Furthermore, we report here for the first time the presence of several recently described viruses in China, and the identification of novel genotypes. Therefore, our investigation results provide an unbiased survey of viral communities and prevalence in faecal samples of piglets.","Zhang, Bin; Tang, Cheng; Yue, Hua; Ren, Yupeng; Song, Zhigang",The Journal of general virology,389,1

The objectives of this study were to find out if it was possible to prevent, or delay, the local outbreaks of COVID-19 through restrictions on travel from abroad and if the virus has already established in-country transmission, to what extent would its impact be mitigated through quarantine of symptomatic patients?"" Methods :These questions were addressed in the context of India, using simple mathematical models of infectious disease transmission. While there remained important uncertainties in the natural history of COVID-19, using hypothetical epidemic curves, some key findings were illustrated that appeared insensitive to model assumptions, as well as highlighting critical data gaps. Results :It was assumed that symptomatic quarantine would identify and quarantine 50 per cent of symptomatic individuals within three days of developing symptoms. In an optimistic scenario of the basic reproduction number (R00) being 1.5, and asymptomatic infections lacking any infectiousness, such measures would reduce the cumulative incidence by 62 per cent. In the pessimistic scenario of R0=4, and asymptomatic infections being half as infectious as symptomatic, this projected impact falls to two per cent. Interpretation & conclusions :Port-of-entry-based entry screening of travellers with suggestive clinical features and from COVID-19-affected countries, would achieve modest delays in the introduction of the virus into the community. Acting alone, however, such measures would be insufficient to delay the outbreak by weeks or longer. Once the virus establishes transmission within the community, quarantine of symptomatics may have a meaningful impact on disease burden. Model projections are subject to substantial uncertainty and can be further refined as more is understood about the natural history of infection of this novel virus. As a public health measure, health system and community preparedness would be critical to control any impending spread of COVID-19 in the country.","Mandal, Sandip; Bhatnagar, Tarun; Arinaminpathy, Nimalan; Agarwal, Anup; Chowdhury, Amartya; Murhekar, Manoj; Gangakhedkar, Raman R; Sarkar, Swarup",The Indian journal of medical research,389,1

To conduct highly accurate and effective infection screening, we are working on the development of a contactless infection screening system using Doppler radar and thermography. In our previous work, three parameters (face temperature, heartbeat rate, and respiration rate) were used to judge whether a subject was infected. However, facial temperature measurements may be vastly different from temperatures measured at the axilla owing to influence from the immediate environment. In this study, heartbeat rate (HR), respiration rate (RR), and standard deviation of heartbeat interval (SDHI) were used to quantify the infection screening system without using facial temperature as a parameter. We found that respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) diminished in patients who had dengue fever. We gathered data from 47 patients with dengue fever using a 10-GHz Doppler radar system at the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases (NHTD) in Hanoi, Vietnam. To evaluate the accuracy, the data of these patients were compared to that of 23 unaffected subjects.

The so-called emerging applications are those for which the evidence has not achieved level A, mainly because the number or sample size of the published studies does not allow conclusive meta-analysis. These emerging applications are the post-surgical period, palliation of dyspnea, asthma attack, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and to prevent extubation failure.

Healthcare is rich in evidence-based innovations, yet even when such innovations are implemented successfully in one location, they often disseminate slowly, if at all, so their clinical use remains limited and heterogeneous. The low rate of NIV use in some hospitals relates to lack of knowledge about or experience with NIV, insufficient confidence in the technique, lack of NIV equipment, and inadequate funding. But NIV use has been increasing around the world, thanks partly to improved technologies. The skill and confidence of clinicians in NIV have improved with time and experience, but NIV is and should remain a team effort, rather than the property of a single local ""champion,"" because, overall, NIV is beautiful!","Nava, Stefano",Respiratory care,389,16

Laparoscopy and robot-assisted surgery are emergent surgical approaches for liver resections, even in posteriorly located lesions. The objective of this study was to compare robot-assisted to laparoscopic parenchymal-preserving liver resections for lesions located in segments 7, 8, 4a, and 1. METHODS Demographics, comorbidities, clinicopathologic characteristics, surgical treatments, and outcomes from patients who underwent laparoscopic and robot-assisted liver resection in two centers for lesions in the posterosuperior segments between June 2008 and February 2014 were reviewed. A 1:2 matched propensity score analysis was performed by individually matching patients in the robotic cohort to patients in the laparoscopic cohort based on demographics, comorbidities, performance status, tumor stage, location, and type of resection. RESULTS Thirty-six patients who underwent robot-assisted liver resection were matched with 72 patients undergoing laparoscopic liver resection. Matched patients displayed no significant differences in postoperative outcomes as measured by blood loss, hospital stay, R0 negative margin rate, and mortality. The overall morbidity according to the comprehensive complication index was also similar (34.6 ± 33 vs. 18.4 ± 11.3, respectively, for robotic and laparoscopic approach, p = 0.11).

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Ten eligible, regular blood donors were paired and studied before donation (fresh blood) and during storage of RBCs in standard blood banking conditions. Plasma and cellular characteristics and modifications were evaluated by standard laboratory and biochemical or biologic analyses as well as by statistical and network analysis tools.

In these patients, it is incredibly important that patients are on the lowest possible dosage of the JAK inhibitor. In addition, these patients must be routinely screened by a dermatologist with a comprehensive skin exam to ensure early detection if skin cancer was to develop.

METHODS We illustrate the approach using data for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer (n = 5914, 33% event fraction) and obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD; n = 4888, 44% event fraction). We used logistic regression to develop a prediction model consisting only of a priori selected predictors and assumed linear relations for continuous predictors. We mimicked prospective patient recruitment by developing the model on 100 randomly selected patients, and we used bootstrapping to internally validate the model. We sequentially added 50 random new patients until we reached a sample size of 3000 and re-estimated model performance at each step. We examined the required sample size for satisfying the following stopping rule: obtaining a calibration slope ≥ 0.9 and optimism in the c-statistic (or AUC) < = 0.02 at two consecutive sample sizes. This procedure was repeated 500 times. We also investigated the impact of alternative modeling strategies: modeling nonlinear relations for continuous predictors and correcting for bias on the model estimates (Firth's correction). RESULTS Better discrimination was achieved in the ovarian cancer data (c-statistic 0.9 with 7 predictors) than in the CAD data (c-statistic 0.7 with 11 predictors). Adequate calibration and limited optimism in discrimination was achieved after a median of 450 patients (interquartile range 450-500) for the ovarian cancer data (22 events per parameter (EPP), 20-24) and 850 patients (750-900) for the CAD data (33 EPP, 30-35). A stricter criterion, requiring AUC optimism < = 0.01, was met with a median of 500 (23 EPP) and 1500 (59 EPP) patients, respectively. These sample sizes were much higher than the well-known 10 EPP rule of thumb and slightly higher than a recently published fixed sample size calculation method by Riley et al. Higher sample sizes were required when nonlinear relationships were modeled, and lower sample sizes when Firth's correction was used. CONCLUSIONS Adaptive sample size determination can be a useful supplement to fixed a priori sample size calculations, because it allows to tailor the sample size to the specific prediction modeling context in a dynamic fashion.","Christodoulou, Evangelia; van Smeden, Maarten; Edlinger, Michael; Timmerman, Dirk; Wanitschek, Maria; Steyerberg, Ewout W; Van Calster, Ben",Diagnostic and prognostic research,389,1

Drawing on historical accounts of prior supply disruptions, this commentary offers some initial speculation as to the possible effects of COVID-19 on the supply of synthetic drugs like fentanyl and precursor chemicals supplied to North America from China, which may have important lessons for other parts of the globe. Prior supply disruptions coincided with elevated prices and reduced purities of street drugs as well as increases in the number of users entering treatment. However, it is challenging to predict how developments will unfold given the unprecedented nature of this pandemic. A short-term breakdown in supply chains, interrupted trade, or social distancing mandates may not have much of an effect on the availability of synthetic drugs. Yet, disruptions in trade for months or years could shape how drugs are supplied or used. Drug policy will need to evaluate market indicators as soon as they are available but responding now with expanded medication therapies, like methadone, may help save lives. The drug policy landscape could look different in a post-COVID world.","Pardo, Bryce",The International journal on drug policy,389,16

The Australian Dementia Network (ADNeT) Registry is being established as part of the ADNeT initiative, with the primary objective of collecting data to monitor and enhance the quality of care and patient outcomes for people diagnosed with either dementia or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). A secondary aim is to facilitate the recruitment of participants into dementia research and trials. This paper describes the Registry protocol. METHODS The ADNeT Registry is a prospective CQR of patients newly diagnosed with either dementia or MCI. Eligible patients will be identified initially from memory clinics and individual medical specialists (e.g., geriatricians, psychiatrists and neurologists) involved in the diagnosis of dementia. Participants will be recruited using either an opt-out approach or waiver of consent based on three key determinants (capacity, person responsible, and communication of diagnosis). Data will be collected from four sources: participating sites, registry participants, carers, and linkage with administrative datasets. It is anticipated that the Registry will recruit approximately 10,000 participants by the end of 2023. The ADNeT registry will be developed and implemented to comply with the national operating principles for CQRs and governed by the ADNeT Registry Steering Committee. DISCUSSION The ADNeT Registry will provide important data on current clinical practice in the diagnosis, treatment and care of people with dementia and MCI in Australia as well as long-term outcomes among these people. These data will help to identify variations in clinical practice and patient outcomes and reasons underlying these variations, which in turn, will inform the development of interventions to improve care and outcomes for people with dementia and MCI.","Lin, Xiaoping; Wallis, Kasey; Ward, Stephanie A; Brodaty, Henry; Sachdev, Perminder S; Naismith, Sharon L; Krysinska, Karolina; McNeil, John; Rowe, Christopher C; Ahern, Susannah",BMC geriatrics,389,16

SEARCH METHODS PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Scopus, and Web-of-Science databases were searched with no restrictions on publication status or year. SELECTION CRITERIA Prospective and retrospective human studies about BAMP, in at least three patients, were included. Authors were contacted when necessary, and reference lists of the included studies were screened. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors undertook independent data extraction with conflict resolution by a third author. Risks of bias were assessed. A meta-analysis for estimates of changes for ANB angle, Wits appraisal, and incisor to mandibular plane angle (IMPA) angle of BAMP treatment compared to control groups was performed. RESULTS A total of 449 articles were initially retrieved; 28 full-text articles met the inclusion criteria. Sample sizes ranged from 3 to 52 patients. There was heterogeneity in cephalometric outcomes reported, which prevented the comparison of certain outcomes. ANB angle improved more with BAMP in the maxilla combined with facemask (bone-anchored facemask, BAFM) compared to traditional facemask therapy: this was statistically but not clinically significant (0.2 degrees). No data are available for BAMP with skeletal anchorage in both jaws in combination with Class III elastics (bone-anchored Class III elastics, BAC3E). Likewise, no statistically significant differences in Wits appraisal were found (less than 1 mm). Lower incisor retroclination and facial height seemed to be better controlled with BAC3E compared to BAFM. CONCLUSIONS The level of evidence available to support the maxillary advancement effect after BAMP was low. Publications reporting results based on identical samples tended to suggest overly positive results of BAMP. The differences in sagittal correction between BAMP and traditional facemask therapy were small and of questionable clinical significance. Long-term follow-up results are not available and, therefore, much needed. LIMITATIONS Most articles had a low level of evidence and some included a historical control group.

METHODS ANationwide cohort study including all people alive in Denmark by March 1, 2020. Exposed patients constituted those exposed to thiopurines (N=5,484), methotrexate (N=17,977), systemic corticosteroids (N=55,868), anti-TNF-α agents (N=17,857), anti-interleukin therapeutic agents (N=3,744), selective immunosuppressive agents (N=3,026), and cyclosporine/tacrolimus (N=1,143) in a period of 12 months prior to March 1, 2020 (estimated time of outbreak in Denmark). We estimated the adjusted risk of hospitalization for COVID-19 for patients treated with the above-mentioned categories of medications, compared to the rest of the population. RESULTS The adjusted odds ratios of hospitalization in patients treated with corticosteroids and cyclosporine/tacrolimus were 1.64 (95% CI 1.35 to 2.00) and 4.75 (95% CI 1.96 to 11.49), respectively. The risks of hospitalization in patients treated with thiopurines, methotrexate, and anti-TNF-α agents, were 1.93 (95% CI 0.91 to 4.08), 0.74 (95% CI 0.43 to 1.28), 1.00 (95% CI 0.52 to 1.94), respectively. The number of outcomes in patients treated with anti-interleukin therapeutic agents and selective immunosuppressive agents was too small for analysis. CONCLUSIONS Patients treated with systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporine/tacrolimus had a significantly increased risk of being hospitalized for COVID-19. Our study does not uncover whether the increased risk is related to the drug itself, the underlying condition for which the patient is treated, or other factors.","Nørgård, Bente Mertz; Nielsen, Jan; Knudsen, Torben; Nielsen, Rasmus Gaardskaer; Larsen, Michael Due; Jølving, Line Riis; Kjeldsen, Jens",British journal of clinical pharmacology,389,7

AIMS/OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate how many patients with olfactory function impairment, which was detected in a validated olfactory test 3 months after COVID-19 disease, showed improvement in olfactory function after 6 months. METHODS About 26 patients with a PCR-confirmed, former COVID-19 disease, with an impaired olfactory function after three months, were included in the study. The olfactory function was evaluated with the sniffing sticks test, the taste function with taste sprays. RESULTS Smelling function improved in all but one patient (96%). All measured subitems, i.e. olfactory threshold, identification and discrimination of odours significantly improved. In the whole mouth taste test all patients showed normal taste function. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE 6 months after COVID-19 disease, olfactory function improves in just about all patients. Long-term measurements must investigate whether complete regeneration of the olfactory function will occur in all patients.","Otte, Martin Sylvester; Bork, Marie-Luise; Zimmermann, Philipp Heinrich; Klussmann, Jens Peter; Luers, Jan Christoffer",Acta oto-laryngologica,389,1

The mean age of the patients at the time of diagnosis of PRES was 8.95±3.66 years. Most patients (80.4%) had a primary diagnosis of acute leukemia. Patients received chemotherapy (71.4%) and/or used steroids within 14 days before the diagnosis of PRES (85.7%). Hypertension was found in 83.9% of the patients. Twenty-six patients had infections and 22 of them had febrile neutropenia. The most common electrolyte disorders were hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypopotassemia. Six patients had tumor lysis syndrome and 4 had inappropriate antidiuretic hormone syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging was used for diagnosis in all patients. The most commonly involved regions by magnetic resonance imaging were occipital (58%), parietal (51%), and frontal lobes (45%), respectively. Twenty-five patients required intensive care and 7 patients were intubated. In conclusion, PRES may develop during the follow-up and treatment of hematological diseases.

Several studies found that these drops correlated with local decreases in transportation and/or industry. None of these studies, however, has rigorously quantified the statistical significance of these drops relative to natural meteorological variability and other factors that influence pollutant levels during similar time periods in previous years. Here, we develop a novel statistical protocol that accounts for seasonal variability, transboundary influences, and new factors such as COVID-19 restrictions in explaining trends in several pollutant levels at 16 ground-based measurement sites in Southern Ontario, Canada. We find statistically significant and temporary drops in NO2 (11 out 16 sites) and CO (all 4 sites) in April-December 2020, with pollutant levels 20% lower than in the previous three years. Fewer sites (2-3 out of 16) experienced statistically significant drops in O3 and PM2.5. The statistical significance testing framework developed here is the first of its kind applied to air quality data. It highlights the benefit of a rigorous assessment of statistical significance, should analyses of pollutant levels post COVID-19 lockdowns be used to inform policy decisions.","Al-Abadleh, Hind A; Lysy, Martin; Neil, Lucas; Patel, Priyesh; Mohammed, Wisam; Khalaf, Yara",Journal of hazardous materials,389,1

However, few reports are available regarding stenting performed for hypoplastic vertebral artery (HVA) with multiple atherosclerotic lesions. Combining multiple neuroendovascular devices provides more possibilities for technical success. We describe a stenting technique using a distal intracranial catheter (Navien) for providing an approach to an HVA with multiple existing atherosclerotic lesions. The technique involves a coaxial system comprising a 6F 70-cm long sheath and 5F 115-cm Navien catheter, which provides a stable support and a shorter distance for the navigation of a balloon-mounted stent. Thus, a stent can be easily delivered avoiding any obstacles such as curves or tortuosity in the VA without distal advancement of the microwire. CONCLUSION The procedure was completed successfully with neither arterial perforation nor injury of the vessel wall. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has reported the use of a Navien catheter in an HVA as an adjunctive technique for the delivery of an Apollo intracranial stent. The combination of the Apollo stent and Navien catheter is an alternative technique that may improve the safety of intracranial stenting procedure.","Wei, Ming; Ma, Yuxiang; Yin, Long",Medicine,389,1

However, to elucidate the neurobiological underpinnings of such disorders or impairments, animal models are more useful when paired with methods for measuring brain function in awake, behaving animals. Standard tools used for systems-neuroscience level investigations are not optimized for large-scale and high-throughput behavioral battery testing due to various factors including cost, time, poor longevity, and selective targeting limited to measuring only a few brain regions at a time. Here we describe two different ""user-friendly"" methods for building extracellular electrophysiological probes that can be used to measure either single units or local field potentials in rats performing cognitive tasks. Both probe designs leverage several readily available, yet affordable, commercial products to facilitate ease of production and offer maximum flexibility in terms of brain-target locations that can be scalable (32-64 channels) based on experimental needs. Our approach allows neural activity to be recorded simultaneously with behavior and compared between micro (single unit) and more macro (local field potentials) levels of brain activity in order to gain a better understanding of how local brain regions and their connected networks support cognitive functions in rats. We believe our novel probe designs make collecting electrophysiology data easier and will begin to fill the gap in knowledge between basic and clinical research.","Francoeur, Miranda J; Tang, Tianzhi; Fakhraei, Leila; Wu, Xuanyu; Hulyalkar, Sidharth; Cramer, Jessica; Buscher, Nathalie; Ramanathan, Dhakshin R",Frontiers in psychiatry,389,1

We developed and validated a brief scale to identify burned-out parents and parents at burnout risk. In Study 1, we developed the 5-item Brief Parental Burnout scale (BPBs) based on the gold standard measure of parental burnout, the Parental Burnout Assessment (PBA). We applied Item Response Theory Graded Response Model (GRM) analyses on the data of 1,725 Finnish parents. Compared against the PBA total score, the five selected items showed both high sensitivity and specificity in screening parental burnout. As expected, burned-out parents and those at burnout risk according to the BPBs displayed higher depressive symptoms, lower self-esteem, and more frequent sleep disruptions than non-burned-out parents. In Study 2, we tested the sensitivity and specificity of the BPBs by using both the BPBs and the PBA as independent assessment tools in a sample of 1,088 Finnish parents. In Study 3, the high sensitivity and specificity of the BPBs found in Study 2 were replicated in an independent sample of 104 Belgian parents. We further demonstrated the concurrent validity of the BPBs test score interpretations by showing that burned-out parents, or those at burnout risk, reported higher child neglect and parental violence than non-burned-out parents. Because of its user-friendliness and the strong psychometric properties of its test score, the BPBs is a good candidate to use as a screening tool for parental burnout.

Main text We review the current data on the epidemiology, the possible underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and the therapeutic implications of PE in relation to COVID-19. The incidence of PE is reported to be around 2.6-8.9% of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients and up to one-third of those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, despite standard prophylactic anticoagulation. This may be explained by direct and indirect pathologic consequences of COVID-19, complement activation, cytokine release, endothelial dysfunction, and interactions between different types of blood cells. Conclusion Thromboprophylaxis should be started in all patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the hospital. The use of an intermediate therapeutic dose of low molecular weight (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin can be considered on an individual basis in patients with multiple risk factors for venous thromboembolism, including critically ill patients admitted to the ICU. Decisions about extending prophylaxis with LMWH after hospital discharge should be made after balancing the reduced risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with the risk of increased bleeding events and should be continued for 7-14 days after hospital discharge or in the pre-hospital phase in case of pre-existing or persisting VTE risk factors. Therapeutic anticoagulation is the cornerstone in the management of patients with PE. Selection of an appropriate agent and correct dosing requires consideration of underlying comorbidities.","Sakr, Yasser; Giovini, Manuela; Leone, Marc; Pizzilli, Giacinto; Kortgen, Andreas; Bauer, Michael; Tonetti, Tommaso; Duclos, Gary; Zieleskiewicz, Laurent; Buschbeck, Samuel; Ranieri, V Marco; Antonucci, Elio",Annals of intensive care,389,1

Universal Prenatal testing for SARS CoV-2 the causative agent of COVID-19 has been recommended for all pregnant women in the current epicenter, New York City. However, due to the lack of evidence of vertical transmission, teratogenicity, treatment, or change in management of COVID-19 positive asymptomatic patients, this may not be the solution to controlling its spread. False-negative test results may also give inaccurate reassurance in otherwise infectious patients and false-positive tests may result in unnecessary distress and isolation.

The number of outward and inward daily commuters was extracted from national census databases related to the population and their commuting habits. For urban area A, with the larger number of daily inward commuters (110,000, compared to 53,000 for B), lockdown was observed to have an effect on the monthly load averages of chemical oxygen demand, biochemical oxygen demand, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total suspended solids and total phosphorus, all of which decreased (confidence level of 95%). This decrease, which varied between 20% and 40% and reached 45% for COD, can be related to the cessation of catering and activities such as hairdressing, which generate large amounts of graywater.

Accumulative evidence suggests that TNP interferes with cognitive functions, however the underlying mechanisms are not known. The aim of this study was to investigate decision-making performance as well as synaptic and large-scale neural synchronized alterations in the spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpV) circuitry and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neural circuitry in male rats with TNP. Rat gambling task showed that ION-CCI led to decrease the proportion of good decision makers and increase the proportion of poor decision makers. Electrophysiological recordings showed long-lasting synaptic potentiation of local field potential in the trigeminal ganglia-SpV caudalis (SpVc) synapses in TNP rats. In this study, TNP led to disruption of ACC spike timing and basolateral amygdala (BLA) theta oscillation associated with suppressed synchronization of theta oscillation between the BLA and ACC, indicating reduced neuronal communications. Myelination is critical for information flow between brain regions, and myelin plasticity is an important feature for learning. Neural activity in the cortical regions impacts myelination by regulating oligodendrocyte (OL) proliferation, differentiation, and myelin formation. We characterized newly formed oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and mature OLs are reduced in TNP and are associated with reduced myelin strength in the ACC region. The functional disturbances in the BLA-ACC neural circuitry is pathologically associated with the myelin defects in the ACC region which may be relevant causes for the deficits in decision-making in chronic TNP state.","Murugappan, Suresh K; Hasan, Mahadi; Lei, Zhuogui; Iqbal, Zafar; Ramkrishnan, Aruna S; Wong, Heung Y; Li, Ying",Journal of neuroscience research,389,31

With BVS and UCS, significantly fewer additional clips were required (MES 9 versus BVS 0 versus UCS 3; P < 0.001) and there was a trend towards lower blood loss (125 versus 50 versus 50 ml respectively; P = 0.223) and a reduced volume of suction fluid (425 versus 80 versus 110 ml; P = 0.058). Overall satisfaction was similar for the three instruments. Dissection with BVS and UCS was significantly cheaper than with MES, assuming a centre volume of 200 cases per year (P = 0.009). CONCLUSION BVS and UCS shorten dissection time in laparoscopic left-sided colectomy and are cost-effective compared with MES.","Hubner, M; Demartines, N; Muller, S; Dindo, D; Clavien, P-A; Hahnloser, D",The British journal of surgery,389,23

Over the past few years, the world has seen several outbreaks caused by viral diseases that for a long time seemed to possess no risk. These are diseases that have been forgotten for a long time and, until nowadays, there are no approved drugs or vaccines, leading the pharmaceutical industry and several research groups to run out of time in the search for new pharmacological treatments or prevention methods. In this context, drug repurposing proves to be a fast and economically viable technique, considering the fact that it uses drugs that have a well-established safety profile. Thus, in this review, we present the main advances in drug repurposing and their benefit for searching new treatments against emerging viral diseases. METHODS We conducted a search in the bibliographic databases (Science Direct, Bentham Science, PubMed, Springer, ACS Publisher, Wiley, and NIH's COVID-19 Portfolio) using the keywords 'drug repurposing', 'emerging viral infections' and each of the diseases reported here (CoV; ZIKV; DENV; CHIKV; EBOV and MARV) as an inclusion/exclusion criterion. A subjective analysis was performed regarding the quality of the works for inclusion in this manuscript. Thus, the selected works were those that presented drugs repositioned against the emerging viral diseases presented here by means of computational, high-throughput screening or phenotype-based strategies, with no time limit and of relevant scientific value. RESULTS 291 papers were selected, 24 of which were CHIKV; 52 for ZIKV; 43 for DENV; 35 for EBOV; 10 for MARV; and 56 for CoV and the rest (72 papers) related to the drugs repurposing and emerging viral diseases. Among CoV-related articles, most were published in 2020 (31 papers), updating the current topic. Besides, between the years 2003 - 2005, 10 articles were created, and from 2011 - 2015 there were 7 articles, portraying the outbreaks that occurred at that time. For ZIKV, similar to CoV, most publications were during the period of outbreaks between the years 2016 - 2017 (23 articles). Similarly, most CHIKV (13 papers) and DENV (14 papers) publications occur at the same time interval. For EBOV (13 papers) and MARV (4 papers), they were between the years 2015 - 2016. Through this review, several drugs were highlighted that can be evolved in vivo and clinical trials as possible used against these pathogens showed that remdesivir represent potential treatments against CoV. Furthermore, ribavirin may also be a potential treatment against CHIKV; sofosbuvir against ZIKV; celgosivir against DENV, and favipiravir against EBOV and MARV, representing new hopes against these pathogens. CONCLUSIONS The conclusions of this review manuscript show the potential of the drug repurposing strategy in the discovery of new pharmaceutical products, as from this approach, drugs that could be used against emerging viral diseases. Thus, this strategy deserves more attention among research groups and is a promising approach to the discovery of new drugs against emerging viral diseases and also other diseases.","Dos Santos Nascimento, Igor José; de Aquino, Thiago Mendonça; da Silva-Júnior, Edeildo Ferreira",Current medicinal chemistry,389,27

Evidence has shown that astrocytes express netrin-1 receptors, including DCC and UNC5H2. However, whether netrin-1 influences the function of astrocytes was previously unknown. METHODS Lipopolysaccharide was used to stimulate the primary cultured astrocytes; interleukin release was used to track astrocyte activation. In vivo, shRNA and netrin-1 protein were injected in the mouse brain. Infarct volume, astrocyte activation, and interleukin release were used to observe the function of netrin-1 in neuroinflammation and brain injury after middle cerebral artery occlusion. RESULTS Our results demonstrated that netrin-1 reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1β and interleukin-12β release in cultured astrocytes, and blockade of the UNC5H2 receptor with an antibody reversed this effect. Additionally, netrin-1 increased p-AKT and PPAR-γ expression in primary cultured astrocytes. In vivo studies showed that knockdown of netrin-1 increased astrocyte activation in the mouse brain after middle cerebral artery occlusion (p < 0.05). Moreover, injection of netrin-1 attenuated GFAP expression (netrin-1 0.27 ± 0.06 vs. BSA 0.62 ± 0.04, p < 0.001) and the release of interleukins and reduced infarct volume after brain ischemia (netrin-1 0.27 ± 0.06 vs. BSA 0.62 ± 0.04 mm3, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Our results indicate that netrin-1 is an important molecule in regulating astrocyte activation and neuroinflammation in cerebral ischemia and provides a potential target for ischemic stroke therapy.","He, Xiaosong; Liu, Yanqun; Lin, Xiaohong; Yuan, Falei; Long, Dahong; Zhang, Zhijun; Wang, Yongting; Xuan, Aiguo; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Journal of neuroinflammation,389,33

However, the risks and benefits of prescription opioids should be carefully considered when treating this patient population. A dramatic increase in opioid-related morbidity and mortality has been observed in the United States in the past decade. Therefore, health care providers must balance the treatment of chronic pain with the need to minimize the risks of opioid misuse, abuse, addiction, and diversion. Current literature suggests that most patients with chronic pain are managed at the primary care level. However, many of these practitioners are not skilled in risk assessment, stratification, and monitoring. This article reviews strategies and tools that providers may implement to help identify appropriate patients for chronic opioid therapy and recognize signs of drug-related aberrant behaviors and abuse. In addition, the potential role of abuse-deterrent, extended-release opioid formulations to reduce risk in patients and nonmedical users of opioids is introduced. Collectively, these preventative measures may effectively reduce opioid misuse, abuse, and diversion without denying adequate analgesia in appropriate patients.","Gudin, Jeffrey A",Postgraduate medicine,389,1

Why should individuals of two different species cooperate? In this case, as in all others, cooperation is not automatic, but rather requires the mediation of evolutionary conflicts. In chemiosmosis, redox reactions produce a trans-membrane ""proton-motive force"" that powers energy-requiring reactions in most organisms. Chemiosmosis may also have a role in conflict mediation. Chemiosmosis rapidly produces considerable amounts of products, increasing the risk of end-product inhibition and the formation of dangerous by-products, such as reactive oxygen species. While several mechanisms can modulate chemiosmosis, potential negative effects can also be ameliorated by simply dispersing excess product into the environment. This ""free lunch you are forced to make"" can attract individuals of other species leading to groups, in which other organisms share the products that are released into the environment by the chemiosmotic cell or organism. Since the time of Darwin, evolutionary biology has recognized that groups are the key to the evolution of cooperation. With many small groups, chance associations of cooperators can arise, even if cooperation is selected against at the individual level. Groups of cooperators can then outcompete groups of defectors, which do not cooperate. Indeed, numerous symbioses may have arisen in this way, perhaps most notably the symbioses of host cells and chemiosmotic bacteria that gave rise to the eukaryotic cell. Other examples in which one partner relies on chemiosmotic products supplied by the other include lichens, corals or other metazoans and dinoflagellates, sap-feeding insects, and plant-rhizobia and plant-mycorrhiza interactions. More problematic are cases of gut microbiomes-for instance, those of termites, ruminants, and even human beings. Under some but not all circumstances, chemiosmosis can be co-opted into punishing defectors and enforcing cooperation, thus leading to mutualistic symbioses.","Blackstone, Neil W",Results and problems in cell differentiation,389,7

However, muscle contractions and general muscle tension may impair the surgical view and cause difficulties suturing the hernial defect. Deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) paralyses the abdominal wall muscles and may help to create better surgical conditions. OBJECTIVES The current study investigated if deep compared with no NMB improved the surgical view during laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. DESIGN Crossover study. SETTING The study was carried out at Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark and conducted from May 2015 until February 2017. PARTICIPANTS A total of 34 patients were randomised in an investigator-initiated, assessor-blinded crossover design of deep vs. no NMB during laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. INCLUSION CRITERIA Adults scheduled for elective laparoscopic ventral hernia repair. EXCLUSION CRITERIA Known allergy to any study medication, known homozygous variants in the butyrylcholinesterase gene, severe renal disease, neuromuscular disease, lactating or pregnant women, any indication for rapid sequence induction. INTERVENTIONS Deep NMB was established with rocuronium and reversed with sugammadex. Anaesthesia was conducted with propofol and remifentanil. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was evaluation of surgical view assessed on a five-point rating scale. Other outcomes included the surgical conditions during laparoscopic suturing of the hernia defect. RESULTS We found no difference in ratings for the surgical view when comparing deep with no NMB: mean -0.1 (95% confidence interval -0.4 to 0.2) (P = 0.521, paired t test). However, deep compared with no NMB improved the rating score for surgical conditions while suturing the hernia defect (P = 0.012, Mann-Whitney U test). No differences were found in either total length of surgery (P = 0.76) or hernia suturing time (P = 0.81). CONCLUSION Deep compared with no NMB did not change the rating score of the surgical view immediately after introduction of trocars during laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, but the surgical condition were improved during suturing of the hernia.

METHODS We analyzed new cases of COVID-19 identified in Florianópolis residents between February 1 and July 14, 2020, using a nowcasting approach. Decrees related to COVID-19 published in the Official Gazette of the Municipality between February 1 and July 14, 2020 were also analyzed. Based on the actions proposed in the decrees, whether they loosened social distancing measures, or increased or maintained existing restrictions, was analyzed, thus creating a Social Distancing Index. Time-dependent reproduction numbers (Rt) for a period of 14 days prior to each decree were calculated. A matrix was constructed associating the classification of each decree and the Rt values, analyzing the consonance or dissonance between the potential dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 and the actions of the decrees. RESULTS A total of 5,374 cases of COVID-19 and 26 decrees were analyzed. Nine decrees increased social distancing measures, nine maintained them, and eight loosened them. Of the 26 actions, 9 were consonant and 17 dissonant with the tendency indicated by the Rt. Dissonance was observed in all of the decrees that maintained the distance measures or loosened them. The fastest expansion in the number of new cases and the greatest amount of dissonant decrees was found in the last two months analyzed.

The purpose of this study was to determine if there is imaging evidence of olfactory apparatus pathology in patients with COVID-19 and neurologic symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective case-control study compared the olfactory bulb and olfactory tract signal intensity on thin-section T2WI and postcontrast 3D T2 FLAIR images in patients with COVID-19 and neurologic symptoms, and age-matched controls imaged for olfactory dysfunction. RESULTS There was a significant difference in normalized olfactory bulb T2 FLAIR signal intensity between the patients with COVID-19 and the controls with anosmia (P = .003). Four of 12 patients with COVID-19 demonstrated intraneural T2 signal hyperintensity on postcontrast 3D T2 FLAIR compared with none of the 12 patients among the controls with anosmia (P = .028). CONCLUSIONS Olfactory bulb 3D T2 FLAIR signal intensity was greater in the patients with COVID-19 and neurologic symptoms compared with an age-matched control group with olfactory dysfunction, and this was qualitatively apparent in 4 of 12 patients with COVID-19. Analysis of these preliminary finding suggests that olfactory apparatus vulnerability to COVID-19 might be supported on conventional neuroimaging and may serve as a noninvasive biomarker of infection.","Strauss, S B; Lantos, J E; Heier, L A; Shatzkes, D R; Phillips, C D",AJNR.

Recent data indicate that antiobesity bariatric procedures e.g. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (RYGB), which also remit diabetes, increase plasma BAs in humans, leading to the hypothesis that BAs may play a role in diabetes resolution following surgery. To investigate the effect of RYGB on BA physiology and its relationship with glucose homeostasis, we undertook RYGB and SHAM surgery in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) and normoglycemic Sprague Dawley (SD) rats and measured plasma and fecal BA levels, as well as plasma glucose, insulin, Glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and Peptide YY (PYY), 2 days before and 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after surgery. RYGB decreased body weight and increased plasma GLP-1 in both SD and ZDF rats while decreasing plasma insulin and glucose in ZDF rats starting from the first week. Compared to SHAM groups, both SD-RYGB and ZDF-RYGB groups started to have increases in plasma total BAs in the second week, which might not contribute to early post-surgery metabolic changes. While there was no significant difference in fecal BA excretion between SD-RYGB and SD-SHAM groups, the ZDF-RYGB group had a transient 4.2-fold increase (P<0.001) in 24-hour fecal BA excretion on post-operative day 3 compared to ZDF-SHAM, which paralleled a significant increase in plasma PYY. Ratios of plasma and fecal cholic acid/chenodeoxycholic acid derived BAs were decreased in RYGB groups. In addition, tissue mRNA expression analysis suggested early intestinal BA reabsorption and potentially reduced hepatic cholic acid production in RYGB groups. In summary, we present novel data on RYGB-mediated changes in BA metabolism to further understand the role of BAs in RYGB-induced metabolic effects in humans.","Bhutta, Hina Y; Rajpal, Neetu; White, Wendy; Freudenberg, Johannes M; Liu, Yaping; Way, James; Rajpal, Deepak; Cooper, David C; Young, Andrew; Tavakkoli, Ali; Chen, Lihong",PloS one,389,31

DESIGN Prospective observational case-control study. SETTING University-affiliated hospital. PATIENT(S) A total of 26 men with varicocele and 26 fertile men without the disorder. INTERVENTIONS Analysis of semen quality and sperm DNA methylation patterns. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Semen quality evaluated by semen analysis, and sperm DNA methylation patterns investigated using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip platform. RESULT(S) Men with varicocele displayed decreased semen quality. The sperm DNA methylation analysis showed that men with varicocele exhibit global hypomethylation in comparison with the control group. A total of 59 differentially methylated CpG sites were identified, most of them hypomethylated in the varicocele group. In regional analyses, 1,695 DNA regions were differentially methylated in men with varicocele. These regions show associations with gamete generation, meiotic and meiosis cell cycle, and semen quality based on gene ontology analysis. CONCLUSION(S) Gene ontology results suggest that changes in methylation may be associated with the low semen quality phenotype observed in some varicocele patients because the observed differentially methylated regions in varicocele patients are related to male reproductive pathways. Additionally, the varicocele grade may influence the magnitude of global sperm DNA methylation change.

METHODS Fifty patients were enrolled were assigned randomly to receive passive insulation (control group, n = 25) or forced-air skin surface warming for 20 min before spinal anesthesia (pre-warming group, n = 25). The primary outcome was temperature at PACU admission. RESULTS The pre-warming group had a significantly higher temperature on admission to the PACU than the control group (35.9 °C [0.1] vs 35.6 °C [0.1], P = 0.023; 95% confidence interval of mean difference, 0.1 °C-0.5 °C). The trend of decreasing core temperature intraoperatively was not different between groups (P = 0.237), but intraoperative core temperature remained approximately 0.2 °C higher in the pre-warming group (P = 0.005). The incidence of hypothermia on admission to the PACU was significantly lower in the pre-warming group (56% vs 88%, P = 0.025). Shivering occurred in 14 patients in the control group, and 4 patients in the pre-warming group (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION Brief pre-warming at 45 °C increased perioperative temperature and decreased the incidence of hypothermia and shivering. However, it was not sufficient to modify the decline of intraoperative core temperature or completely prevent hypothermia and shivering. Continuing pre-warming to immediately before induction of spinal anesthesia or combining pre-warming with intraoperative active warming may be necessary to produce clearer thermal benefits in this surgical population.

Ideally, such objects are removed in the emergency department utilizing a combination of local anesthesia, sedation, minimal instrumentation, and manual extraction. In some instances, simple manual extraction is unsuccessful and general anesthesia may be necessary. We describe a novel approach to retrieval and removal of a rectal foreign body utilizing a SILS port. CASE DESCRIPTION A 31-y-old male presented to the emergency department approximately 12 h after transanal insertion of a plastic cigar case. Abdominal examination revealed no evidence of peritonitis. On rectal examination, the tip of the cigar case was palpable. The foreign body, however, was unable to be removed manually in the emergency department. In the operating room, with the patient under general anesthesia, multiple attempts to remove the object were unsuccessful. A SILS port was inserted transanally. The rectum was then insufflated manually by attaching the diaphragm of the rigid sigmoidoscope to the SILS insufflation port. A 5-mm 0-degree laparoscope was placed through the SILS port. An atraumatic laparoscopic grasper was then placed through the port and used to grasp the visible end of the cigar case. The rectal foreign body was removed expeditiously. Direct visualization of the rectum revealed no evidence of mucosal injury. The patient was discharged home shortly after the procedure. DISCUSSION The SILS port allows minimally invasive extraction of rectal foreign bodies not amenable to simple manual extraction. It provides excellent visualization and eliminates the morbidity inherent in more invasive and traditional methods of retrieval.","Bak, Yury; Merriam, Margaret; Neff, Marc; Berg, David A",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,389,19

We explore the use of multimodal computed tomography in predicting this complication. METHODS All patients were administered intravenous alteplase with/without intra-arterial therapy. An age- and sex-matched case-control design with classic and conditional logistic regression techniques was chosen for analyses. Outcome was parenchymal hemorrhage on 24- to 48-hour imaging. Exposure variables were imaging (noncontrast computed tomography hypoattenuation degree, relative volume of very low cerebral blood volume, relative volume of cerebral blood flow ≤7 mL/min·per 100 g, relative volume of Tmax ≥16 s with all volumes standardized to z axis coverage, mean permeability surface area product values within Tmax ≥8 s volume, and mean permeability surface area product values within ipsilesional hemisphere) and clinical variables (NIHSS [National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale], onset to imaging time, baseline systolic blood pressure, blood glucose, serum creatinine, treatment type, and reperfusion status). RESULTS One-hundred eighteen subjects (22 patients with parenchymal hemorrhage versus 96 without, median baseline NIHSS score of 15) were included in the final analysis. In multivariable regression, noncontrast computed tomography hypoattenuation grade (P<0.006) and computerized tomography perfusion white matter relative volume of very low cerebral blood volume (P=0.04) were the only significant variables associated with parenchymal hemorrhage on follow-up imaging (area under the curve, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.83). Interrater reliability for noncontrast computed tomography hypoattenuation grade was moderate (κ=0.6).

Bilateral cataract surgery can help to improve visual performance and to diminish the burden of childhood blindness. Objective To report in a retrospective observational cohort study the long-term outcomes of 298 children who had bilateral cataract surgery with IOL implantation from 2001-2016 in Kinshasa. Methods A standardized surgical treatment of paediatric cataract was practiced on 298 children. Patient's follow-up, complications, and visual outcomes were recorded and analysed. Results The mean age was 5.7 ± 4.3 years and males were predominant (64.9%). Most of children were living mainly in urban poorest areas (96.3%). Strabismus, nystagmus and microcornea were encountered in 20.1%, 25.1% and 8.7% of children, respectively. Using WHO criteria most of patients were classified as blind preoperatively and 81.9% of them had improved visual outcomes after surgery. Main reasons for reduced vision during follow-up were secondary cataract (5.7%), IOL decentration (1.2%), retinal detachment (1.2%), and secondary glaucoma (1.5%). Conclusion In spite of the post conflict challenges, elimination of cataract blindness in children remains a priority. Children present at a late age for surgery and long term follow-up is poor. There is need for program strengthening in these areas.","Ngoy, Janvier Kilangalanga; Stahnke, Thomas; Dinkulu, Serge; Makwanga, Emile; Moanda, Astrid; Ngweme, Georgette; Mukwanseke, Edith; Kundt, Günther; Thiesen, Frank; Hopkins, Adrian; Guthoff, Rudolf F",African health sciences,389,1

Intervention protocols meant to mitigate cerebral desaturation advocate to increase mean arterial pressure (MAP) when cerebral desaturation occurs. However, the isolated effect of MAP on rScO2 is uncertain. The aim of the present study was in a randomized, blinded design to elucidate the effect of 2 distinct levels of MAP on rScO2 values during CPB.We hypothesized that a higher MAP would be reflected in higher rScO2 values, lower frequency of patients with desaturation, and a less pronounced cerebral desaturation load. METHODS This is a substudy of the Perfusion Pressure Cerebral Infarct trial, in which we investigated the impact of MAP levels during CPB on ischemic brain injury after cardiac surgery. Deviation in rScO2 was a predefined outcome in the Perfusion Pressure Cerebral Infarct trial. Patients were randomized to low MAP (LMAP; 40-50 mm Hg) or high MAP (HMAP; 70-80 mm Hg) during CPB. CPB pump flow was fixed at 2.4 L/min/m, and MAP levels were targeted using norepinephrine. Intraoperatively, NIRS monitoring was performed in a blinded fashion, with sensors placed on the left and right side of the patient's forehead. NIRS recordings were extracted for offline analysis as the mean value of left and right signal during prespecified periods. Mean rScO2 during CPB was defined as the primary outcome in the present study. RESULTS The average MAP level during CPB was 67 mm Hg ± SD 5.0 in the HMAP group (n = 88) and 45 mm Hg ± SD 4.4 in the LMAP group (n = 88). Mean rScO2 was significantly lower in the HMAP group during CPB (mean difference, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-6.1; P = .010). There was no difference in rScO2 values at specified time points during the intraoperative period between the 2 groups. Significantly more patients experienced desaturation below 10% and 20% relative to rScO2 baseline in the HMAP group (P = .013 and P = .009, respectively), and the cerebral desaturation load below 10% relative to rScO2 baseline was more pronounced in the HMAP group (P = .042). CONCLUSIONS In a randomized blinded study, we observed that a higher MAP induced by vasopressors, with a fixed CPB pump flow, leads to lower mean rScO2 and more frequent and pronounced cerebral desaturation during CPB. The mechanism behind these observations is not clear. We cannot exclude extracranial contamination of the NIRS signal as a possible explanation. However, we cannot recommend increasing MAP by vasoconstrictors during cerebral desaturation because this is not supported by the findings of the present study.","Holmgaard, Frederik; Vedel, Anne G; Lange, Theis; Nilsson, Jens C; Ravn, Hanne B",Anesthesia and analgesia,389,1

Pervasive gender stereotypes about roles that were (and are) occupied by men and women lead to implicit assumptions about competency in said roles. For example, women may receive more negative verbal interruptions or nonverbal cues that undermine their authority as a leader, a stereotypically male-typed role. The coronavirus pandemic has led to the rapid rise in videoconferencing in professional interactions; however, little is known about videoconferencing etiquette and how gender bias permeates to this new setting. Although there are many benefits to the use of this technology, it has the potential to reinforce gender bias rooted in cultural and societal norms, gender stereotypes, and traditional gender roles. The well-documented implicit biases that have been shown to favor men over women during in-person meetings may translate to further gender gaps in leadership during virtual meetings. It is also possible that videoconferencing could be used to reduce gender bias, but until we have research to shine a light on this topic, this article provides 10 tips for promoting gender equity during virtual meetings.","Dhawan, Natasha; Carnes, Molly; Byars-Winston, Angela; Duma, Narjust",Journal of women's health,389,24

Although usually caused by viral infections, it is frequently treated with antibiotics. Such inappropriate use of antibiotics might best be challenged by offering efficacious and safe symptomatic pain relief instead. However, there is need for robust evidence to support such alternatives. Presently, the evidence from randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials (RCT) with the local anaesthetic ambroxol (CAS 23828-92-4) in the treatment of sore throat is being reviewed. This relates to five RCT in 1,772 patients; 1,713 were evaluable with regard to efficacy. Treatment with ambroxol lozenges was statistically significantly superior to placebo in reducing sore throat pain intensity with a high level of consistency of the estimated effect across the different studies. The effect had an early onset and lasted up to at least 3 h after a single first lozenge. The pain relief was associated with a statistically superior regression of pharyngeal redness and inflammation; with ambroxol, the overall efficacy was more frequently rated as at least ""good"". Treatment with the ambroxol lozenges was well tolerated. There was heterogeneity in reporting adverse events: in one later study with less severe baseline pain intensity there was more frequent reporting of hypoaesthesia of the oral cavity and tongue as an untoward phenomenon. In patients with more severe baseline pain this reflection of the medication's pharmacological action was only rarely reported as untoward. It is concluded that lozenges containing 20 mg ambroxol are a safe and efficacious treatment for acute uncomplicated sore throat of recent onset in adult patients.","de Mey, Christian; Peil, Hubertus; Kölsch, Stephan; Bubeck, Jürgen; Vix, Jean-Michel",Arzneimittel-Forschung,389,1

METHODS In a randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned 3002 patients to receive either fondaparinux, administered subcutaneously at a dose of 2.5 mg once daily, or placebo for 45 days. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of death from any cause or symptomatic pulmonary embolism, symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, or symptomatic extension to the saphenofemoral junction or symptomatic recurrence of superficial-vein thrombosis at day 47. The main safety outcome was major bleeding. The patients were followed until day 77. RESULTS The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 13 of 1502 patients (0.9%) in the fondaparinux group and 88 of 1500 patients (5.9%) in the placebo group (relative risk reduction with fondaparinux, 85%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 74 to 92; P<0.001). The incidence of each component of the primary efficacy outcome was significantly reduced in the fondaparinux group as compared with the placebo group, except for the outcome of death (0.1% in both groups). The rate of pulmonary embolism or deep-vein thrombosis was 85% lower in the fondaparinux group than in the placebo group (0.2% vs. 1.3%; 95% CI, 50 to 95; P<0.001). Similar risk reductions were observed at day 77. A total of 88 patients would need to be treated to prevent one instance of pulmonary embolism or deep-vein thrombosis. Major bleeding occurred in one patient in each group. The incidence of serious adverse events was 0.7% with fondaparinux and 1.1% with placebo. CONCLUSIONS Fondaparinux at a dose of 2.5 mg once a day for 45 days was effective in the treatment of patients with acute, symptomatic superficial-vein thrombosis of the legs and did not have serious side effects.

This survey is an ecological study, so all studied variables are aggregate variables. To collect the variables in the study, a data set was provided, which includes the information of each country based on the cumulative deaths, case fatality rate, recovery rate, and the number of performed COVID-19 tests. Scatter plots of environmental factors for the studied countries were drawn based on cumulative incidence rate of cases, cumulative incidence rate of death, tests, recovery rate, and case fatality rate of COVID-19. Furthermore, Spearman correlation coefficient was also used to verify the correlation between environmental factors and indicators related to COVID-19. The results of this ecological study showed that among all countries surveyed, Montenegro (60,310.56 per million) and Luxembourg (54,807.89 per million) had the highest cumulative incidence rates of COVID-19 cases, when Tanzania (8.42 per million) and Vietnam (13.78 per million) had the lowest cumulative incidence rates of COVID-19. In addition, in this study, it was shown that the cumulative incidence rate of cases, the cumulative incidence rate of deaths, and performed COVID-19 tests had significant direct correlations with the access to drinking water and the access to sanitation services (p < 0.001). The findings of the present study showed an inverse correlation between the mortality rate due to unhealthy water consumption, poor health status, and a positive correlation between access to drinking water and health services with the cumulative incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19. The differences between our findings and many other studies could be due to the ecological nature of the study. Nevertheless, our findings will help health policymakers to develop timely strategies to reduce the mortality and incidence rate of COVID-19.","Mirahmadizadeh, Alireza; Rezaei, Fatemeh; Jokari, Kimia; Moftakhar, Leyla; Hemmati, Abdolrasool; Dehghani, Seyed Sina; Hassani, Amir Hossein; Lotfi, Mehrzad; Jafari, Alireza; Ghelichi-Ghojogh, Mousa",Environmental science and pollution research international,389,26

Our objective was to assess the haemodynamic consequences of SA in infants, particularly its impact on cerebral perfusion using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based cerebral oximetry (rSco2). Methods All infants up to 60 weeks' postmenstrual age, whether formerly preterm or not, and undergoing spinal anaesthesia, were enrolled. Haemodynamic data records, rSco2 and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), were prospectively collected before SA (T0) and every five min for 30 min (T30) after the puncture. Compared with baseline measures, any changes of > 10% in rSco2 and of > 20% in MAP were considered clinically significant. Relative variations of data between T0 and T30 were analysed. Results Data of 103 infants were analysed. The mean relative changes in rSco2 were -2.25% (97.5% CI [-3.97; -0.5]) at T15, and 0.11% (97.5% CI [-1.67; 1.90]) at T30. No significant variation of rSco2 was recorded. The mean changes in MAP were respectively -13.94% (97.5% CI [-17.74; -10.14]) at T15 and -20.27% (97.5% CI [-24,25; -16.29]) at T30. MAP decrease was statistically and clinically significant 30 min after SA. No correlation between changes in MAP and rSco2 was found. The subgroup analysis did not reveal any effect of added intrathecal clonidine or preterm birth history on these results. Conclusions In neonate and infants, SA did not cause clinically significant variation in cerebral oxygen saturation. Despite a significant decrease in MAP, cerebral auto-regulation seems to remain effective in neonates and not altered by spinal anaesthesia.","Sola, C; Hertz, L; Bringuier, S; De La Arena, P; Macq, C; Deziel-Malouin, S; Raux, O; Dadure, C",British journal of anaesthesia,389,7

There is an increasing body of evidence that prophylactic mesh placement (PMP) can be safe and efficient in the short-term outcomes, but there still are some concerns about the potential long-term complications of these meshes. This study describes our long-term PMP experience. METHODS Observational and prospective study including all patients undergoing the use of prophylactic onlay large-pore polypropylene meshes for the closure of ML since 2008 to 2014. Outcome measures included demographics, perioperative details, wound complications, recurrences, reoperations and chronic complications. RESULTS A cohort of 172 patients was analysed: 75% elective surgery, 25% emergency cases. Mean age was 68 years with mean body mass index (BMI) of 28.6 kg/m2. Wound classification: 6.4% clean; 85% clean-contaminated; 1.2% contaminated and 8.1% dirty. Follow-up of patients was up to 8 years (mean: 5 ± 1.6). Two meshes were removed due to chronic infection in first six postoperative months. Of the 13 patients (9.02%) who developed IH, 5 of them have been reoperated for IH repair without any difficulty related to previous mesh. During follow-up, 8 patients have been reoperated for other reasons and the integrity of abdominal wall was also checked. After the comparative study, higher BMI and emergency surgery were still risk factors for IH despite PMP. CONCLUSIONS In our setting, the use of polypropylene prophylactic meshes in MLs is safe, efficient and durable.","San Miguel, C; Melero, D; Jiménez, E; López, P; Robin, Á; Blázquez, L A; López-Monclús, J; González, E; Jiménez, C; García-Ureña, M Á",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,389,1

GLP-2 stimulates crypt cell proliferation, increases intestinal blood flow, enhances gut barrier function, induces mucosal healing, and exerts an anti-apoptotic effect. Due to these effects GLP-2 is used in the treatment of short bowel syndrome (SBS). Areas covered: The aim of this systematic review was to provide information on the potential risk of intestinal neoplasia in patients receiving treatment with GLP-2. The literature search was performed independently by two authors in the following databases; Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane. Expert commentary: This systematic review indicated that treatment with GLP-2(1-33) up to 30 months in humans without any known pre-existing cancer did not confer an increased risk of intestinal neoplasia in patients or animals. However, due to the small amount of patients studied it is premature to reach any final conclusions about GLP-2 - induced neoplasia. GLP-2(1-33) treatment in animals with a pre-induced cancer showed that GLP-2(1-33) may promote growth of existing neoplasia.","Ring, Linea Landgrebe; Nerup, Nikolaj; Jeppesen, Palle Bekker; Svendsen, Lars Bo; Achiam, Michael Patrick",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,389,17

Because lido+epi is injected whereas others are not, care must be taken to label all solutions to avoid inadvertent injection of oxymetazoline or concentrated epinephrine because of life-threatening complications. Dyes have been used to color solutions for visual identification, but efficacy and cost have never been compared. We sought to determine the effectiveness of surgical marking pen (gentian violet) and fluorescein strips as coloring agents in mediums commonly used in sinus surgery. METHODS In this specialty techniques study, 4 liquid mediums (normal saline [NS], 0.05% oxymetazoline, 1:1,000 epinephrine, and lido+epi) and 2 coloring agents (fluorescein strip and surgical marking pen) were combined separately. Photos and absorbance of each solution were obtained at 15-minute intervals over 2 hours using a spectrophotometer. RESULTS Peak absorbance remained stable for all solutions with fluorescein. Absorbance also remained constant for NS (0.37 absorbance units [AU] → 0.37 AU) and oxymetazoline (2.8 AU → 2.8 AU) mixed with marking pen. Absorbance decreased over 2 hours when marking pen was mixed with 1:1000 epinephrine (0.82 AU → 0.32 AU) and lido+epi (1.19 AU → 0.33 AU). Furthermore, the majority of color visibility and absorbance decreased in the first 15 minutes for concentrated epinephrine (0.82 → 0.33) and lido+epi (1.19 → 0.51). Cost of fluorescein strips ($0.14 to $0.20/strip) was less than marking pens ($13 to 46/pen). CONCLUSION Compared to marking pen dye, solutions dyed with fluorescein retained their color and did not decay over time. We recommend fluorescein strips to label colorless materials in the operating room because of their lack of color decay and cost advantages.","Yao, William C; Regone, Rachel M; Takashima, Masayoshi",International forum of allergy & rhinology,389,31

Attempts to effectively contain the spread of infectious diseases have been hampered by the lack of rapidly adaptable, accurate, and accessible point-of-care diagnostic testing. In this study, we present a novel design of a label-free DNAzyme-based detection method called Rapidemic. This assay combines recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) with linear strand-displacement amplification (LSDA) and guanine-quadruplex (GQ) DNAzyme-catalysed colour-changing reaction. The colorimetry basis of the signal readout omits the need for extensive instrumentation. Moreover, the primer-based sequence detection of RPA gives Rapidemic a potential to be rapidly adapted to target a new sequence. As a proof of concept, we developed the assay to detect isolated genomic DNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The use of low-pH buffers and the optimization of the dilution rates from each preceding reaction to the next showed to be successful strategies to enable visible detection with this method. These findings demonstrate for the first time that a label-free DNAzyme-based detection method can be coupled to RPA and LSDA for nucleic acid detection.","van den Brink, Marijn; Tandar, Sebastian T.; van den Akker, Tim A.

To verify the two loci and gain additional insight into the genetic architecture controlling virus infection, introgression lines (ILs) that together cover chromosome IV, were exposed to OrV. Of the 27 ILs used, 17 had an CB4856 introgression in an N2 background and 10 had an N2 introgression in a CB4856 background. Infection of the ILs confirmed and fine-mapped the locus underlying variation in OrV susceptibility and we found that a single nucleotide polymorphism in cul-6 contributes to the difference in OrV susceptibility between N2 and CB4856. An allele swap experiment showed the strain CB4856 became more susceptible by having an N2 cul-6 allele, although having the CB4856 cul-6 allele did not increase resistance in N2. Additionally, we found that multiple strains with non-overlapping introgressions showed a distinct infection phenotype from the parental strain, indicating that there are punctuated locations on chromosome IV determining OrV susceptibility. Thus, our findings reveal the genetic complexity of OrV susceptibility in C. elegans and suggest that viral susceptibility is governed by multiple genes.","Sterken, Mark G.; van Sluijs, Lisa; Wang, Yiru A.; Ritmahan, Wannisa; Gultom, Mitra L.; Riksen, Joost A.G.; Volkers, Rita J.M.; Snoek, L.

Our primary objective was to assess whether gout is a risk factor for diagnosis of COVID-19 and death related to COVID-19. The secondary objectives were to test for sex- and drug-specific differences in risk. Methods We used data from the UK Biobank that included 15,560 people with gout. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression was employed in the following analyses using a case-control study design: Analysis A, to test for association between gout and COVID-19 diagnosis (n=459,837); Analysis B, to test for association between gout and death related to COVID-19 in a case-control cohort of people who died or survived with COVID-19 (n=16,336); Analysis C, to test for association between gout and death related to COVID-19 in the entire UK Biobank cohort (n=459,837); Analysis D, to stratify by prescription of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) and colchicine on the risk of death related to COVID-19 in a subset of the UK Biobank cohort with medication data (n=341,398). Findings Gout was associated with diagnosis of COVID-19 in analysis A (OR=1.2 [1.1 ; 1.3]) but not with risk of death in the COVID-19-diagnosed group in analysis B. In analysis C gout associated with risk of death related to COVID-19 in the unadjusted model (OR=3.9 [3.3 ; 4.7]), in Model 1 adjusted for demographic factors (OR=1.8 [1.5 ; 2.1]) and in the fully adjusted Model 2 (OR=1.3 [1.1 ; 1.6]). In Analysis C risk was higher in women than men in Model 1 adjusted for demographic factors (OR=3.5 [2.4 ; 5.0] and OR=1.5 [1.2 ; 1.8], respectively) with the difference maintained after additional adjustment for eight metabolic co-morbidities (ORMen=1.2 [0.9 ; 1.5], ORWomen=1.9 [1.3 ; 2.9]). There were no statistically significant differences in risk of death related to COVID-19 according to prescription of ULT or colchicine. Interpretation Gout is a risk factor for death related to COVID-19 using the UK Biobank cohort with an increased risk in women with gout that was also driven by risk factors outside metabolic co-morbidities of gout.","Topless, R.; Gaffo, A.; Stamp, L.; Robinson, P.; Dalbeth, N.; Merriman, T.",,389,1

The recent inclusion of bedaquiline into TB drug regimens has improved treatment outcomes, but this advance is threatened by the emergence of strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) resistant to bedaquiline. Clinical bedaquiline resistance is most frequently conferred by resistance-associated variants (RAVs) in the Rv0678 gene which can also confer cross-resistance to clofazimine, another TB drug. We compiled a dataset of 3,682 Mtb genomes, including 223 carrying Rv0678 bedaquiline RAVs. We identified at least 15 cases where RAVs were present in the genomes of strains collected prior to the use of bedaquiline in TB treatment regimes. Phylogenetic analyses point to multiple emergence events and in some cases widespread circulation of RAVs in Rv0678, often prior to the introduction of bedaquiline or clofazimine. Strikingly, this included three cases predating the antibiotic era. The presence of a pre-existing reservoir of bedaquiline-resistant Mtb strains necessitates the urgent implementation of rapid drug susceptibility testing and individualised regimen selection to safeguard the use of bedaquiline in TB care and control.","van Dorp, Lucy; Nimmo, Camus; Ortiz, Arturo Torres; Pang, Juanita; Acman, Mislav; Tan, Cedric C.S.; Millard, James; Padayatchi, Nesri; Grant, Alison; O’Donnell, Max; Pym, Alex; Brynildsrud, Ola B; Eldholm, Vegard; Grandjean, Louis; Didelot, Xavier; Balloux, François",bioRxiv,389,16

The virus recognizes the host cell by attaching its Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the host receptor ACE2. Therefore, RBD is a primary target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccines. Here we report the isolation, and biological and structural characterization of two single-chain antibodies (nanobodies, DL4 and DL28) from RBD-immunized alpaca. Both nanobodies bind Spike with affinities that exceeded the detection limit (picomolar) of the biolayer interferometry assay and neutralize the original SARS-CoV- 2 strain with IC50 of 0.086 μg mL-1 (DL4) and 0.385 μg mL-1 (DL28). DL4 and a more potent, rationally designed mutant, neutralizes the Alpha variant as potently as the original strain but only displays marginal activity against the Beta variant. By contrast, the neutralizing activity of DL28, when in the Fc-fused divalent form, was less affected by the mutations in the Beta variant (IC50 of 0.414 μg mL-1 for Alpha, 1.060 μg mL-1 for Beta). Crystal structure studies reveal that DL4 blocks ACE2-binding by direct competition, while DL28 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 by an uncommon mechanism through which DL28 distorts the receptor-binding motif in RBD and hence prevents ACE2-binding. Our work provides two neutralizing nanobodies for potential therapeutic development and reveals an uncommon mechanism to design and screen novel neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","Li, Tingting; Zhou, Bingjie; Luo, Zhipu; Lai, Yanling; Huang, Suqiong; Zhou, Yuanze; Gautam, Anupriya; Bourgeau, Salome; Wang, Shurui; Bao, Juan; Tan, Jingquan; Lavillette, Dimitri; Li, Dianfan",bioRxiv,389,20

Almost 1/4 of patients with CRC have metastases at the initial presentation. The survival rate of this group of patients remains low. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, cancer patients have faced difficulties in getting diagnosis or treatment, which could potentially lead to an increase in late-stage tumors and mortality. This situation required changes in approaches to the treatment of cancer patients, such as replacing drugs with tablet forms, schemes with long intervals, and much more. It is known that about 50% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer survive in satisfactory condition until the 3rd line drug therapy or longer. One of the main drugs for this category of patients is regorafenib, which, thanks to the tablet formulation, has become especially important in the COVID-19 pandemic. In numerous clinical studies, the drug showed an increase in patient overall survival and good safety profile. In addition, there is growing evidence of the effect of regorafenib on tumor sensitivity to treatment with platinum drugs, irinotecan, and EGFR inhibitors. © 2021 Consilium Medikum.

Moreover, a novel metric, population times travel time (PT), was proposed to identify localities with a greater likelihood of undetected COVID-19 outbreaks and to aid in the placement of upstream samplers. Findings suggest that travel time has a greater influence on viral loss across the sewershed as compared to temperature. SARS-CoV-2 viral loss at median travel times was approximately two times greater in 20 degrees Celsius wastewater between the small sewershed, Chocolate Bayou, and the larger sewershed, 69th Street. Lastly, placement of upstream samplers according to the PT metric can provide a more representative snapshot of disease incidence in large sewersheds. This study helps to elucidate discrepancies between SARS-CoV-2 viral load in wastewater and clinical incidence of COVID-19.

The therapeutic techniques were developed in the context of working with clients with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD);however, the ideas can also be used when working with clients who do not meet a diagnosis of PTSD but have experienced trauma or adversity and feel guilty. The techniques in this article are therefore widely applicable: to veterans, refugees, survivors of abuse, the bereaved, and healthcare professionals affected by COVID-19, amongst others. We consider how to assess and formulate feelings of guilt and suggest multiple cognitive and imagery strategies which can be used to reduce feelings of guilt. When working with clients with a diagnosis of PTSD, it is important to establish whether the guilt was first experienced during the traumatic event (peri-traumatically) or after the traumatic event (post-traumatically). If the guilt is peri-traumatic, following cognitive work, this new information may then need to be integrated into the traumatic memory during reliving. Key learning aims (1) To understand why feelings of guilt may arise following experiences of trauma or adversity. (2) To be able to assess and formulate feelings of guilt.

Augmented Reality (AR) enables mobile users to utilize text labels, in order to provide a composite view associated with additional information in a real-world environment. Nonetheless, displaying all labels for points of interest on a mobile device will lead to unwanted overlaps between information, and thus a context-responsive strategy to properly arrange labels is expected. The technique should remove overlaps, show the right level-of-detail, and maintain label coherence. This is necessary as the viewing angle in an AR system may change rapidly due to users' behaviors. Coherence plays an essential role in retaining user experience and knowledge, as well as avoiding motion sickness. In this paper, we develop an approach that systematically manages label visibility and levels-of-detail, as well as eliminates unexpected incoherent movement. We introduce three label management strategies, including (1) occlusion management, (2) level-of-detail management, and (3) coherence management by balancing the usage of the mobile phone screen. A greedy approach is developed for fast occlusion handling in AR. A level-of-detail scheme is adopted to arrange various types of labels. A 3D scene manipulation is then built to simultaneously suppress the incoherent behaviors induced by viewing angle changes. Finally, we present the feasibility and applicability of our approach through one synthetic and two real-world scenarios, followed by a qualitative user study.","Koppel, Thomas; Groller, M.

The development of novel antiviral agents is considered an urgent research subject. Objectives: The objective of the study is to discover the phenolic constituents of the methanolic extract of Tecoma mollis Humb. and Bonpl. heartwood and to investigate their potential inhibitory action against SARS-CoV-2 protease and/or entry proteins. Materials and Methods: The heartwood of T. mollis was extracted by maceration with 70% EtOH until complete exhaustion. The extract was concentrated under reduced pressure, mixed with distilled H2O and defatted with CHCl3 to produce a CHCl3 fraction, and then subjected to solvent fractionation with n-butanol to produce an n-butanol fraction. The n-butanol fraction was subjected to a silica gel column using CHCl3–MeOH gradient mixtures followed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The isolated compounds were identified using one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance as well as mass spectroscopy. Molecular docking studies have been implemented to identify the binding pattern between ligands and target enzymes, i.e. main protease (Mpro) and spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), and compared with the currently used COVID-19 inhibitors. Molecular dynamic simulations have been performed to evaluate the dynamics and stability of protein–ligand complexes. The obtained information is then correlated with the essential structural features, and finally the structure–activity relationship is suggested. Results: Fourteen phenolic glycosides were isolated from the methanolic extract of T. mollis Humb. and Bonpl. heartwood in addition to an iridoid, ixoside. The molecular docking study exhibited that the isolated compounds have a higher binding affinity toward the active site of Mpro and the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 binding site of spike protein RBD. The phenylpropanoids have higher inhibitory action with higher binding energy toward SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease as compared to spike protein RBD. Among all the isolated compounds, isoverbascoside (10) exhibited the most potent dual interaction with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease and spike protein RBD with high binding energy of − 8.8 and − 7.2 kcal/mol, respectively. This showed better potency than the currently used Mpro and spike–protein inhibitors. Conclusion: Our study is the first report on the potential inhibitory action of phenylpropanoids for SARS-CoV-2 protease and spike protein. It also correlates between the reported antiviral activities of some isolated compounds with their potential inhibitory action for COVID-19 viral proteins. Our results on T. mollis extract constituents could help in the discovery of a promising repurposable drug candidate that could contribute to the development of an effective therapy for COVID-19.","Al-Wahaibi, Lamya Rehman Md Al-Saleem Muneera M.; Basudan, Omer El-Gamal Ali AlAjmi Mohamed Backheet Enaam Khalifa Azza Abdel-Mageed Wael",Pharmacognosy Magazine,389,25

This is already difficult for healthy individuals, but may be particularly challenging for individuals with neuropsychiatric conditions.ObjectivesOur main goal was to examine (i) whether capabilities in body and face language reading are connected to each other in healthy females and males;and (ii) whether capabilities to body/face language reading are related to other social abilities.MethodsHealthy females and males accomplished a task with point-light body motion portraying angry and neutral locomotion along with a task with point-light faces expressing happiness and angriness. They had to infer emotional content of displays. As a control condition, perceivers were administered with the RMET-M (Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, Modified) with static images.ResultsFemales excelled on inferring emotions from body locomotion. Moreover, only in females, inferring emotions from body and face were firmly linked, whereas in males, face reading was connected to performance on the RMET-M.ConclusionsThe outcome points to gender-specific modes in social cognition: females rely upon merely dynamic cues in facial and bodily displays, whereas males most likely trust configural information. The findings are of value for investigation of face/body language reading in neuropsychiatric conditions, most of which are gender specific.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Böck, K.; Romagnano, V.; Kubon, J.; Sokolov, A.; Fallgatter, A.; Pavlova, M.",European Psychiatry,389,16

The seven-year war in East Ukraine has led to a rise in substance and alcohol use and increasing addiction rates among veterans, internally displaced persons, and civilian survivors. This article examines the combined impact of the ongoing Russo–Ukrainian conflict and COVID-19 pandemic on substance use in Ukraine. It also gives an overview of the institutions in place to monitor and improve mental health in the country. The article highlights the urgent need for further funding and research on substance and alcohol addiction, with vulnerable populations affected by the conflict during the COVID-19 pandemic. Frontline healthcare workers in this region should anticipate an increased burden of patients suffering from substance use disorders who are in need of emergency management intervention and proper behavioral health referrals. © 2021 Weston Medical Publishing.

To exert their function, B cells and T cells differentiate into effector and memory cells. Tight regulation of these differentiation processes is key to prevent their malfunction, which can result in life-threatening disease. Lymphocyte differentiation relies on the appropriate timing and dosage of regulatory molecules, and post-transcriptional gene regulation (PTR) is a key player herein. PTR includes the regulation through RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which control the fate of RNA and its translation into proteins. To date, a comprehensive RBP expression map throughout lymphocyte differentiation is lacking. Using transcriptome and proteome analyses, we here provide an RBP expression map for human B cells and T cells. We observed that even though the overall RBP expression is conserved, the relative RBP expression is distinct between B cells and T cells. Differentiation into effector and memory cells alters the RBP expression, resulting into preferential expression of different classes of RBPs. For instance, whereas naïve T cells express high levels of translation-regulating RBPs, effector T cells preferentially express RBPs that modulate mRNA stability. Lastly, we found that cytotoxic CD8+ and CD4+ T cells express a common RBP repertoire. Combined, our study reveals a cell type-specific and differentiation-dependent RBP expression landscape in human lymphocytes, which will help unravel the role of RBPs in lymphocyte function.","Zandhuis, Nordin D.; Nicolet, Benoit P.; Wolkers, Monika C.",bioRxiv,389,1

Design/methodology/approach A total of 186 private university students was enrolled in this cross-sectional study using a combination of snowball and purposive sampling approaches. Anthropometric measurements, including body height, body weight before and during the MCO enforcement were self-reported by the respondents. Screen-time based sedentary behaviour sedentary behaviour was evaluated using HELENA sedentary behaviour questionnaire, whereas the Self-Regulation of Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (SREBQ) was used to determine the eating self-regulatory skills in MCO. Findings Respondents spent most of the time on the internet for non-study purposes (148 +/- 77.7 min). It is also noted that 64.5% of the respondents had medium eating self-regulatory skill during the MCO, with an average score of 3.0 +/- 0.5. Findings from path analysis confirmed that poor eating self-regulation significantly contributed to the weight gain during home confinement (ss = -0.24, p = 0.01). In conclusion, eating self-regulation, but not total screen time, emerged as the determinant for weight gain during the COVID-19 lockdown. Originality/value According to the authors' knowledge, this study was among the few that investigated sedentary behaviour, eating self-regulatory skills and weight status of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tan, S.

Prior to the pandemic, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the Airports Council International, (ACI) and the respective industry, have expressed their concern that the then today's airport security model was not sustainable in the long term. The vision for a seamless and continuous journey throughout the airport and efficient security resources allocation based on intelligent risk analysis, set the challenging objectives for the Smart Security of the airport of the future. Several projects, such as FLYSEC and TRESSPASS, have been funded by the European Commission (EU) to develop and demonstrate innovative integrated and risk-based end-to-end airport security processes for passengers, while enabling a guided and streamlined procedure from landside to airside and into the boarding gates, offering for the first time an operationally validated innovative concept for end-to-end aviation security. Ironically, the Covid-19 pandemic has put air, but also sea and land, travelling to an almost complete stand-still that has, temporarily at least, muted the debate about alternative security protocols and processes for accommodating ever increasing passenger flows more effectively. Despite the dramatically reduced passenger flows, the concept of risk-based security remains valid both as a research topic and a valid security doctrine that can increase security efficacy. This paper reports developments in risk-based security and updates the status of the OCULUS C2I system as a integrated platform for comprehensive analysis, testing, simulation and implementation of comprehensive risk-based security protocols, algorithms, and processes. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

The study makes an attempt to response to the three following questions: (1) What are the leading contributors (countries, research institutions, authors and source titles) to research production in the field? (2) What are the core references? (3) What are the leading thematic areas / research fronts? Material and Methods We used the Scopus database as a source of bibliometric data for the research sampling process and employed a combination of bibliometric methods, including research profiling and selected science mapping methods, i.e. co-word analysis and direct citation analysis, in order to achieve the aim of the study and provide responses to the study questions. Science mapping processes were supported with VOSviewer software. Results: Research profiling indicates that the main contributors to scientific output on physical activity in the COVID-19 context are scholars and research institutions from countries, which have been heavily affected by the pandemic such as: the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Brazil. Certainly, the reports from China, which was the first nation to suffer from COVID-19 and associated epidemic restrictions, constitute an important input, too. The core references in research on physical activity in the COVID-19 context may be grouped into three categories aimed at: (1) investigating the consequences of pandemic restrictions on physical activity, (2) analysing the outcomes of physical activity for other variables, and (3) providing recommendations for practising home-based physical activity during COVID-19 confinement. Science mapping of the research field conceptual structure indicates the following thematic areas / research fronts in research on physical activity in the COVID-19 context: (1) 'pandemic and its outcomes', (2) 'physical activity during self-isolation', (3) 'health behaviour', (4) 'food habits', (5) 'mental health', (6) 'adults and the pandemic'. Conclusions: The study contributes to development of physical activity theory by profiling and mapping research conducted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through mapping the scientific output, the paper points out the leading contributors and core references, and makes an attempt to identify leading thematic areas / research fronts. Discovering the main signposts may be useful for all the researchers planning and designing research within the field. Moreover, mapping research fronts indicates them the topics attracting attention of the academia and potential research gaps.","Tomanek, M.; Lis, A.",Physical Education of Students,389,26

We report on the recent use of an international rapid foresight survey to assess expected societal trends over the next 3 years following the COVID-19 crisis. The results illustrate the power of collective foresight approaches to provide timely, nuanced insights for decision-making across sectors and scales, particularly in times of uncertainty.Technical summaryWe present the findings of a rapid foresight survey launched in spring 2020 to draw on the collective intelligence of the global community on where the world is headed post-COVID-19. Respondents were asked to (i) assess five key societal trends in the coming 3 years, (ii) provide news headlines they both expect and hope to see, and (iii) assess the role of digital technologies during crises. Analysis of over 2000 responses from more than 90 countries revealed important regional differences in expected societal trends related to sustainability. More respondents in the Global South expected shifts towards less inequality while more respondents in the Global North expected shifts towards a smaller ecological footprint. Qualitative analysis of proposed news headlines revealed four broad themes of focus (environment, equity, health, and economy), and yielded insights into perspectives on critical drivers of change. Finally, the survey report found that the vast majority of respondents were not opposed to digital surveillance in crises. In presenting these results, we explore the value of collective foresight and intelligence exercises in providing pluralistic inputs to decision-making and in complementing more prevalent methods of forecasting.Social media summaryCollective foresight exercises with diverse communities can help chart robust pathways to more sustainable futures.","Wood, Sylvia L.

We previously developed an approach to identify interfering medications using electronic health record (EHR) data, but the approach was limited to UDS assays for which presumptive positives were confirmed using more specific methods. Here we adapted the approach to search for medications that cause false positives on UDS assays lacking confirmation data. Methods: From our institution's EHR data, we used our previous dataset of 698,651 UDS and confirmation results. We also collected 211,108 UDS results for acetaminophen, ethanol, and salicylates. Both datasets included individuals' prior medication exposures. We hypothesized that the odds of a presumptive positive would increase following exposure to an interfering ingredient independently of exposure to the assay's target drug(s). For a given assay-ingredient pair, we quantified potential interference as an odds ratio from logistic regression. We evaluated interference of selected compounds in spiking experiments. Results: Compared to the approach requiring confirmation data, our adapted approach showed only modestly diminished ability to detect interfering ingredients. Applying our approach to the new data, three ingredients had a higher odds ratio on the acetaminophen assay than acetaminophen itself did: levodopa, carbidopa, and entacapone. The first two, as well as related compounds methyldopa and alpha-methyldopamine, produced presumptive positives at < 40 mcg/mL.

Currently, there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs or vaccines specifically for LUJV or other pathogenic OW mammarenaviruses. Here, a high-throughput screening of an FDA-approved drug library was conducted using pseudotype viruses bearing LUJV envelope glycoprotein (GPC) to identify inhibitors of LUJV entry. Three hit compounds, trametinib, manidipine, and lercanidipine, were identified as LUJV entry inhibitors in the micromolar range. Mechanistic studies revealed that trametinib inhibited LUJV GPC-mediated membrane fusion by targeting C410 (located in the transmembrane (TM) domain), while manidipine and lercanidipine inhibited LUJV entry by acting as calcium channel blockers. Meanwhile, all three hits extended their antiviral spectra to the entry of other pathogenic mammarenaviruses. Furthermore, all three could inhibit the authentic prototype mammarenavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and could prevent infection at the micromolar level. This study shows that trametinib, manidipine, and lercanidipine are candidates for LUJV therapy, and highlights the critical role of calcium in LUJV infection. The presented findings reinforce the notion that the key residue(s) located in the TM domain of GPC provide an entry-targeted platform for designing mammarenavirus inhibitors. IMPORTANCE To date, only one LUJV outbreak has been recorded; it occurred in 2008 and resulted in a fatality rate of 80% (4/5 cases). Pathogenesis studies and therapeutic strategies are therefore urgently needed. Repurposing approved drugs can accelerate the development of drug design and facilitate the understanding of infectious mechanisms. Here, three compounds, trametinib, manidipine, and lercanidipine, were identified as entry inhibitors against LUJV. Studying the underling mechanisms revealed that a key residue (C410) in LUJV GPC modulates its sensitivity/resistance to trametinib and demonstrated the critical role of calcium in LUJV infection.","Cao, Junyuan; Liu, Yang; Dong, Siqi; Zhou, Minmin; Guo, Jiao; Jia, Xiaoying; Zhang, Yueli; Hou, Yuxiao; Xiao, Gengfu; Wang, Wei",bioRxiv,389,25

However, compared to other vaccines used across the globe, the real-world data on the effectiveness of Gam-COVID-Vac, especially against the disease caused by Delta variant of concern, was not available. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of vaccination mainly conducted with Gam-COVID-Vac in St. Petersburg, Russia. Methods: We designed a case-control study to assess the vaccine effectiveness (VE) against lung injury and referral to hospital. Self-reported vaccination status was collected for individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were referred for initial low-dose computed tomography triage in two outpatient centres in July 3 -- August 9, 2021 in St. Petersburg, Russia. We used logistic regression models to estimate the adjusted (for age, and triage centre) VE for complete (>14 days after the second dose) and partial vaccination (>14 days after the first dose). We estimated the VE against referral for hospital admission, COVID-19-related lung injury assessed with LDCT, and decline in oxygen saturation. Results: In the final analysis, 13,894 patients were included, 1,291 (9.3%) of patients met our criteria for complete vaccination status, and 495 (3.6%) were referred to hospital. In the primary analysis, the adjusted VE against referral to hospital was 81% (95% CI: 68-88) for complete vaccination. The effect of the partial vaccination was not statistically significant. The VE against referral to hospital was more pronounced in women (84%, 95% CI: 66-92) compared to men (76%, 95% CI: 51-88). Vaccine protective effect increased with increasing lung injury categories, from 54% (95% CI: 48-60) against any sign of lung injury to 76% (95% CI: 59-86) against more than 50% lung involvement. A sharp increase was observed in the probability of hospital admission with age for non-vaccinated patients in relation to an almost flat relationship for the completely vaccinated group. Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination was effective against referral to hospital in patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in St. Petersburg, Russia. This protection is probably mediated through VE against lung injury associated with COVID-19.","Barchuk, A.; Cherkashin, M.; Bulina, A.; Berezina, N.; Rakova, T.; Kuplevatskaya, D.; Stanevich, O.; Skougarevskiy, D.; Okhotin, A.",,389,16

The relatively large files require additional files beyond the scope of the original format, to identify sequences and provide random access. Currently, multiple compressors have been developed to archive FASTA files back and forth, but these lack direct access to targeted content or metadata of the archive. Moreover, these solutions are not directly backwards compatible to FASTA files, resulting in limited software integration. Results We designed linux based a toolkit using Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) that virtualises the content of DNA, RNA and protein FASTA archives into the filesystem. This guarantees in-sync virtualised metadata files and offers fast random-access decompression using Zstandard (zstd). The toolkit, FASTAFS, can track all system wide running instances, allows file integrity verification and can provide, instantly, scriptable access to sequence files and is easy to use and deploy. Conclusions FASTAFS is a user-friendly and easy to deploy backwards compatible generic purpose solution to store and access compressed FASTA files, since it offers file system access to FASTA files as well as in-sync metadata files through file virtualisation. Using virtual filesystems as in-between layer offers the possibility to design format conversion without the need to rewrite code into different languages while preserving compatibility.

In particular, isolation situations due to lockdown have become more challenging for elderly people as they have limited access to technology. At the same time, technologies of remote systems using Internet of Things (IoT) have emerged as a pivotal role for healthcare management and therefore could assist the elderly in managing and improving their mental health and quality of life. In this paper, we suggest the use of wearable devices with health sensors, therapeutic music playback devices, and a cloud-based data collection system as an integrated Internet of Things architecture capable of assessing the level of anxiety and depression of elderly people. Through an accurate monitoring and reporting of the measured temperature, pulse rate, and SpO2, the system is capable of assessing the level of anxiety and depression and triggers the playback of therapeutic music to reduce the level of stress and anxiety. The implementation of the system, using NodeMCU platform, and space time spreading (STS)-aided communication links, emerges as a promising solution to help the healthcare sector and families to manage and reduce the anxiety and depression risks among elderly population. © 2021 IEEE.","Siddiqui, S.; Khan, A.

The goal is to teach current early-career faculty NCI grantees skills in areas critical for successful independent academic cancer research careers. Courses focus on leadership and socioemotional skills, health disparities, immuno-oncology, and cell and gene therapy. Teaching will initially be virtual, given the COVID pandemic. Methods: A steering committee and four working groups were established to build the consortium infrastructure, including the NASDC (osu.edu) website. Clientele are early-career faculty PD/PI of a current NCI-funded grant (K01, K07, K08, K22, K23, K25, R00, R21, DP1, DP2, DP5, R01, R23, R29, R37, R56, RF1, RL1, U01), of whom 454 were directly contacted. Blast emails and social media were also used. We are reporting the characteristics of 154 applicants, who completed the RedCap application online. Results: 85% of the applicants are within the first 5 years of a faculty appointment, 87% at the assistant professor rank, and 65% on tenure track. 40% hold an M.D. degree and 72% a Ph.D. 81% are US citizens, 52% females, and 45/33/16/2/4%-11% are White/Asian/Black/Native Americans/Other-Hispanics/Latino. 76% work at NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers. Mean protected research time is 80%. Nonmutually exclusive fields of research interest are therapeutics (46%), basic science (37%), disparities (34%) prevention (32%), public health (28%), and pediatrics (10%). 66% have received a K-award grant, 13% each an R21 or R00, and 3% an R01. Additionally, 35% had a second NCI grant as PI, 10% a third grant, and 60% had non-NCI grants. Reasons for applying included (1) not quite ready to lead a research team (42%), (2) need for stronger career mentoring (37%), and (3) not being fully confident in research skills (21%). Conclusions: Applicants to the new NCI educational consortium (NASDC) have a successful start to their academic career with a third having obtained more than one NCI award. Most applicants work at NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers. As cancer research continues to evolve and has the potential to address critical health care needs of the nation, NASDC will strive to equip scientists to be leaders, teach advances in technology, and impart confidence in research skills.","Verschraegen, C.

We construct a mathematical model taking pre-immunity, antibody waning and more infectious variants of concern into consideration, thereby providing a theoretical framework in which the cases in Stockholm county can be fully predicted without relying on neither oscillations in restrictions (and public compliance thereof) nor vaccination roll-out.

It was not only proposed as a complement to capacity-plagued clinical testing, but also an early warning tool that may enable timely intervention measures. In this study, we developed a wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA load model based on the fecal shedding profile of infected individuals. The epidemic data of COVID-19 in the Tokyo metropolitan area were used to perform a simulation to analyze the capability of WBE in providing early warning. The simulation result suggests that under the current settings, WBE is not a feasible approach as the detection limit is too high to provide a warning signal in the early stage of the epidemic. However, it also indicates that if the methodology can be reasonably improved by new experimental practices, optimized sampling strategy, and refined model, the concentration of viral RNA in Tokyo wastewater would exceed the detection limit as early as in April 2020, when Tokyo was being hit by the first wave of COVID-19 outbreak. This early detection may have great social benefit if the detection can be used to facilitate the decision-making process and form epidemic emergency response. © 2021.

However, creating a custom-fit computer-aided design (CAD) model for each mask is currently a manual process and thereby not scalable for a pandemic crisis. This paper aims to develop a novel design process to reduce overall design cost and time, thus enabling the mass customisation of 3D printed respirator masks. Design/methodology/approach: Four data acquisition methods were used to collect 3D facial data from five volunteers. Geometric accuracy, equipment cost and acquisition time of each method were evaluated to identify the most suitable acquisition method for a pandemic crisis. Subsequently, a novel three-step design process was developed and scripted to generate respirator mask CAD models for each volunteer. Computational time was evaluated and geometric accuracy of the masks was evaluated via one-sided Hausdorff distance. Findings: Respirator masks were successfully generated from all meshes, taking &lt;2 min/mask for meshes of 50,000∼100,000 vertices and &lt;4 min for meshes of ∼500,000 vertices. The average geometric accuracy of the mask ranged from 0.3 mm to 1.35 mm, depending on the acquisition method. The average geometric accuracy of mesh obtained from different acquisition methods ranged from 0.56 mm to 1.35 mm. A smartphone with a depth sensor was found to be the most appropriate acquisition method. Originality/value: A novel and scalable mass customisation design process was presented, which can automatically generate CAD models of custom-fit respirator masks in a few minutes from a raw 3D facial mesh. Four acquisition methods, including the use of a statistical shape model, a smartphone with a depth sensor, a light stage and a structured light scanner were compared;one method was recommended for use in a pandemic crisis considering equipment cost, acquisition time and geometric accuracy. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Li, S.; Waheed, U.; Bahshwan, M.; Wang, L.

Thoracoscopic thymectomy offers an effective and less traumatic approach with respect to cosmesis and postoperative recovery. METHODS A retrospective analysis of 6 consecutive patients treated with thoracoscopic thymectomy was performed. Perioperative parameters and cost analysis were compared with those of 6 consecutive open procedures performed before the study. RESULTS Thoracoscopic thymectomy can be performed in patients as young as 1.6 years. There was no conversion to open procedure and no perioperative morbidity and mortality. The length of operating time and the surgical cost of thoracoscopic procedure were not significantly different from those of open procedure. The length of hospitalization, however, was significantly shorter with thoracoscopic procedure, and hence the overall cost was significantly reduced (P < .05). An intermediate follow-up shows that outcome after thoracoscopic procedure is equally as effective as open procedure. CONCLUSIONS Thoracoscopic thymectomy offers an equally effective but cosmetically more acceptable approach than sternotomy.

The growing evidence supporting use of opioids for appropriately selected patients means that primary care practitioners must be knowledgeable regarding ever-evolving pain-management strategies. SCOPE This review summarizes core considerations in opioid prescribing in the primary care setting, the risks of undertreatment of pain, the challenges and barriers associated with prescribing opioids, identifying risk factors that may predict problematic use, and emerging formulation technologies expected to assist clinicians in better achieving effective pain control while minimizing risks for misuse or diversion. RESULTS Primary care physicians face considerable challenges in optimizing pain management while minimizing potential for misuse, abuse and diversion. Opioid treatment decisions are based not only on the type of pain but also the patient's psychosocial history, including a screening for predicting aberrant behaviors and, in some patients, substance abuse. New opioid formulations are available to assist clinicians in achieving adequate patient relief while reducing risk of tampering and abuse. Primary care practitioners need to be aware of these new options and integrate them into clinical treatment decisions. CONCLUSIONS The strategic use of new opioid formulations and better patient assessment may lead to more successful use of opioids in the management of pain, while limiting or lowering the risk of the development of an addiction problem, abuse or diversion.","Stanos, Steven",Current medical research and opinion,389,29

A curved-tip catheter was used in all procedures; angle options were chosen depending on lesion location. After navigation to the target lesion, fine-needle aspiration, brushings, biopsies, and bronchoalveolar lavage were performed in all patients. Correct localization was confirmed with fluoroscopy. RESULTS Thirty-one consecutive patients underwent ENB between February and October 2014. The mean lesion size was 1.8 cm (range, 0.4 to 4.0 cm) and 35% were in the right upper lobe. The probe tip was navigated to the target lesion in all cases. A diagnosis was obtained in 30/31 patients (96.8%). Twenty-two (71%) had a definitive histologic diagnosis of malignancy. One case was nondiagnostic requiring a repeat fine-needle aspiration. The remaining 8 nonmalignant cases were followed radiologically and demonstrated no progression of lesion size through at least 1 year. Fiducials were placed in 48% of cases. There were 2 pneumothoraces (6.5%), one of which required chest tube placement (3.2%). CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that the curved-tip catheter is a useful modality for diagnosing peripheral pulmonary lesions with ENB. The diagnostic yield of ENB using this catheter was superior to that reported in other studies utilizing straight catheters.","Mukherjee, Sumit; Chacey, Michael",Journal of bronchology & interventional pulmonology,389,1

However, its importance during infections is still questionable. In this study, we describe that following infection of mice with the human pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi, an immunodominant CD8(+) T cell immune response is developed directed to an H-2K(b)-restricted epitope expressed by members of the trans-sialidase family of surface proteins. To determine whether this immunodominance was exerted over other non-H-2K(b)-restricted epitopes, we measured during infection of heterozygote mice, immune responses to three distinct epitopes, all expressed by members of the trans-sialidase family, recognized by H-2K(b)-, H-2K(k)-, or H-2K(d)-restricted CD8(+) T cells. Infected heterozygote or homozygote mice displayed comparably strong immune responses to the H-2K(b)-restricted immunodominant epitope. In contrast, H-2K(k)- or H-2K(d)-restricted immune responses were significantly impaired in heterozygote infected mice when compared with homozygote ones. This interference was not dependent on the dose of parasite or the timing of infection. Also, it was not seen in heterozygote mice immunized with recombinant adenoviruses expressing T. cruzi Ags. Finally, we observed that the immunodominance was circumvented by concomitant infection with two T. cruzi strains containing distinct immunodominant epitopes, suggesting that the operating mechanism most likely involves competition of T cells for limiting APCs. This type of interference never described during infection with a human parasite may represent a sophisticated strategy to restrict priming of CD8(+) T cells of distinct specificities, avoiding complete pathogen elimination by host effector cells, and thus favoring host parasitism.","Tzelepis, Fanny; de Alencar, Bruna C G; Penido, Marcus L O; Claser, Carla; Machado, Alexandre V; Bruna-Romero, Oscar; Gazzinelli, Ricardo T; Rodrigues, Mauricio M",Journal of immunology,389,17

In this study, we aimed to evaluate its impact on the discharge pattern from an acute medical hospital. METHODS We undertook a hospital-based ecologic study with before-after design using the clinical management database of patient discharge records of all acute medical wards in a hospital from January to March 2002 (1 year before new system) and from January to March 2004 (1 year after restricted weekend service). The main outcome measures were the daily discharge rates for the two periods. The odds of being discharged on a Saturday were estimated by multivariate analyses. RESULTS The number of patient discharge on a Saturday was substantially lower in 2004 as compared to 2002 (47.5 +/- 8.5 per Saturday versus 70.5 +/- 11.1 per Saturday, respectively, p < 0.001). A statistically significant decreased trend was noted in the weekend discharge rate in 2002 and 2004 (Poisson p-value for change in discharge rate, p < 0.001). On the other hand, the number of patient discharges on weekdays did not differ between the two periods. Consistently fewer patients were being discharged on Sundays and Mondays as compared to the rest of the week days in both periods. Compared with study period 2002, patients hospitalized in 2004 (with limited weekend service) had significantly lower multivariate-adjusted odds of being discharged on a Saturday (odds ratio of 0.70; 95 percent confidence interval 0.72-0.89, p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Length of hospital stay is influenced by the health care system delivery apart from clinical factors. Restricted weekend services in an acute medical hospital setting substantially lengthen the hospital stay, and might therefore entail a major financial burden.","Chow, Kai Ming; Szeto, Cheuk Chun",Journal of public health,389,32

DoD sought external analytic support through the RAND Arroyo Center. In response to the questions posed by OMB request, this study finds the following: (1) Current DoD biosurveillance supports three strategic missions. Based mostly on existing statute, the highest-priority mission is force health protection, followed by biological weapons defense and global health security. (2) Guidance issued by the White House on June 27, 2013, specified priorities for planning fiscal year 2015 budgets; it includes an explicit global health security priority, which strengthens the case for this as a key DoD biosurveillance strategic mission. (3) DoD biosurveillance also supports four desired outcomes: early warning and early detection, situational awareness, better decision making at all levels, and forecast of impacts. (4) Programs and measures that address priority missions-force health protection in particular-and desired outcomes should be prioritized over those that do not do so. (5) More near-real-time analysis and better internal and external integration could enhance the performance and value of the biosurveillance enterprise. (6) Improvements are needed in key enablers, including explicit doctrine/policy, efficient organization and governance, and increased staffing and improved facilities for the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center (AFHSC). (7) AFHSC has requested additional funding to fully implement its current responsibilities under the 2012 Memorandum of Understanding between the Assistant Secretaries of Defense for Health Affairs and for Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Defense Programs. Additional responsibilities for coordinating the entire DoD biosurveillance enterprise would need concomitant resourcing. (8) There is not a single, unified funding system for the DoD biosurveillance enterprise; the multiple current funding systems would likely benefit from an organizing mechanism with the authority to manage and control funds to meet enterprise goals. Interim guidance issued by the Deputy Secretary of Defense on June 13, 2013, is significant because it is the first policy to explicitly address biosurveillance; it adopts the definition from the National Strategy for Biosurveillance, calls for development of a DoD Directive for biosurveillance, and specifies tasks for DoD's implementation of the Strategy.","Moore, Melinda; Fisher, Gail; Stevens, Clare",Rand health quarterly,389,17

Guidelines called for reduced frame use and reducing the number of fractions. Our institution implemented these guidelines, and herein we show the resultant effect on patient treatments on our Gamma Knife Icon program. Methods: In early March 2020 we rapidly implemented suggested changes according to ASTRO and other consensus guidelines as they relate to stereotactic radiosurgery in the COVID-19 era. We reviewed the GK Icon schedule at our institution between January 01 and April 30, 2020. We documented age, condition treated, technique (frame vs. mask), and number of fractions. We then tabulated and graphed the number of patients, framed cases, and fractions delivered. Results: Seventy-seven patients were treated on the GK Icon over that period, for a total of 231 fractions. The number of unique patients varied from 18 (April) to 22 (January). Of the 77 patients only 5 were treated using a frame. The number of fractions per month decreased significantly over time, from 70 in January to 36 in April. Likewise, the percentage of single fraction cases increased from 4.5% per month in January to 67% in April. Conclusions: The results presented here show that it is possible to quickly and efficiently change work flows to allow for reduced fractionation and frame use in the time of a global pandemic. Multidisciplinary cooperation and ongoing communication are integral to the success of such programs.","Wegner, Rodney E; Horne, Zachary D; Xu, Linda; Yu, Alexander; Goss, Matthew; Liang, Yun; Sohn, Jason; Colonias, Athanasios; Fuhrer, Russell; Karlovits, Stephen M",Journal of radiosurgery and SBRT,389,8

After establishment of mice model, we observed the clinical signs of disease, virus replication, immunopathogenesis and antibody response. The results indicated that the infected mice showed typical pneumonia, virus replication, histological lesions, and neutralizing antibody production. Moreover, the high dosage group was superior to the low dosage group. Fourteen days after infection, the specific antibody to virus structural protein and neutralizing antibody were analyzed, the high dosage group induced higher level antibody.

Although TSLP has been shown to be produced mainly by airway epithelial cells, the regulation of epithelial TSLP expression has not been extensively studied. We investigated the expression of TSLP in cytokine- or TLR ligand-treated normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE). The mRNA for TSLP was significantly up-regulated by stimulation with IL-4 (5.5-fold) and IL-13 (5.3-fold), weakly up-regulated by TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, and IFN-beta, and not affected by IFN-gamma in NHBE. TSLP mRNA was only significantly up-regulated by the TLR3 ligand (dsRNA) among the TLR ligands tested (66.8-fold). TSLP was also induced by in vitro infection with rhinovirus. TSLP protein was detected after stimulation with dsRNA (120 +/- 23 pg/ml). The combination of TNF-alpha and IL-4 produced detectable levels of TSLP protein (40 +/- 13 pg/ml). In addition, TSLP was synergistically enhanced by a combination of IL-4 and dsRNA (mRNA; 207-fold, protein; 325 +/- 75 pg/ml). The induction of TSLP by dsRNA was dependent upon NF-kappaB and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) signaling via TLR3 as indicated by a study with small interfering RNA. The potent topical glucocorticoid fluticasone propionate significantly suppressed dsRNA-dependent TSLP production in NHBE. These results suggest that the expression of TSLP is induced in airway epithelial cells by stimulation with the TLR3 ligand and Th2 cytokines and that this response is suppressed by glucocorticoid treatment. This implies that respiratory viral infection and the recruitment of Th2 cytokine producing cells may amplify Th2 inflammation via the induction of TSLP in the asthmatic airway.","Kato, Atsushi; Favoreto, Silvio; Avila, Pedro C; Schleimer, Robert P",Journal of immunology,389,20

Studies of genetic recombination in a cell-free system in vitro and in infected tissue culture cells in vivo have led to the unexpected observation that temperature strongly influences the loci at which cross-over between the two recombining RNA strands occurs. Specifically, cross-over between two genetically marked RNA strands in vitro and in vivo at 34 degrees C occurred over a wide range of the genome. In contrast, recombination in vivo at 37 and 40 degrees C yielded cross-over patterns that had shifted dramatically to a region encoding nonstructural proteins. Preferential selection of recombinants at 37 and 40 degrees C was ruled out by analyses of the growth kinetics of the recombinants. During the studies of recombination in the cell-free system we found that there is a direct correlation between the ability of a poliovirus RNA molecule to replicate in the cell-free system and its capacity to complement de novo virus synthesis programmed by another viral RNA.","Duggal, R; Wimmer, E",Virology,389,17

These mRNAs are transcribed from a minus (-) strand template of genome length and contain a leader RNA at their 5' ends. To further elucidate the mechanism of coronavirus transcription, we examined the structure of mouse hepatitis virus replicative intermediates (RIs) isolated by 2 M NaCl precipitation and Sepharose 2-B column chromatography. Purified RIs migrated as a single species on agarose gels and sedimented between 12 and 38S on 10 to 25% sucrose gradients. The complexes were readily heat denatured into a heterogeneous population of smaller RNA molecules which probably represent nascent plus (+) strands. RNase A digestion of RIs produced a single replicative form which sedimented between 30 and 32S. These data suggest that the RI is composed of a single genome-sized (-) strand hydrogen bonded to an average of 4 to 6.5 nascent (+) strands. In contrast, a column-purified replicative form was extremely resistant to RNase A digestion and heat denaturation and migrated as a single RNA species on agarose gels and sucrose gradients. Oligonucleotide fingerprinting of an RI revealed the presence of the 5' leader RNA on the nascent (+) strands. In addition, an average of 6.2 cap structures were present in each RI, which agrees with the average number of nascent (+) strands per RI. These data suggest that the leader RNA is utilized as a primer for mouse hepatitis virus RNA transcription and is not added to mRNA post-transcriptionally.","Baric, R S; Stohlman, S A; Lai, M M",Journal of virology,389,9

METHODS A prospective randomised single-centre study was carried out of 29 female patients, who underwent robot-assisted or laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy for external or internal rectal prolapse with symptoms of obstructive defecation and/or faecal incontinence. Anatomical changes were measured by Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) and magnetic resonance defecography. Functional changes were evaluated using symptom questionnaires before and 3 months after surgery. RESULTS After rectopexy, changes in POP-Q measurements were statistically significant for points Ap, Bp, C, D and Ba. The descent of the anorectum and cervix/vaginal cuff during straining were significantly reduced with regard to the reference line (mean, -10.4 ± 14.9 mm, p = 0.001) and (-13.3 ± 18.1 mm, p < 0.001) respectively. Pelvic organ mobility (POM) was reduced statistically significantly for the posterior (mean, -16.6 ± 20.8 mm, p < 0.001) and apical compartments (mean, -13.1 ± 14.8, p < 0.001). The PFDI-20, PFIQ-7 and PISQ-12 questionnaires showed statistically significant improvement of symptoms and sexual function. No significant differences were observed between the robot-assisted and laparoscopic techniques in terms of anatomical or functional parameters.

METHODS Sixteen patients with parastomal hernia who underwent laparoscopic modified SB repair (LSB) between June 2012 and October 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. LSB was performed using a developed standardized 2-point anchoring and zigzag tacking of Parietex™ Parastomal Mesh (PCO-PM) technique. RESULTS Out of 16 cases, 14 were primary and 2 recurrent hernias; 13 were para-end colostomy and 3 were para-ileal conduit (PIC) hernias. The median longitudinal and transverse diameters of the hernia orifice were 5 cm (2.5-7 cm) and 4.2 cm (2-6 cm), respectively. Five cases had a concomitant midline incisional hernia, which was simultaneously repaired. In all cases, the mesh was placed without deflection. The median operation time was 193 (75-386) min. Perioperative complications occurred in two cases (13 %) with PIC, one intra-operatively and the other postoperatively. The intra-operative complication was enterotomy close to the ureteroenteric anastomosis of the ileal conduit; it was repaired through a mini-laparotomy. LSB was accomplished without any subsequent postoperative complications. The postoperative complication was ureteral obstruction that required creation of nephrostomy. Mini-laparotomy was necessary in those two cases (13 %) because of intra-operative enterotomy and severe intra-abdominal adhesions. The median postoperative length of stay was 9 (5-14) days. No recurrence was observed with a median follow-up of 14.5 (2-41) months. CONCLUSIONS Our LSB using standardized mesh fixation technique is safe and feasible, and the PCO-PM seems to be the most optimal prosthesis.","Suwa, Katsuhito; Nakajima, Shintaro; Uno, Yoshiko; Suzuki, Toshiaki; Sasaki, Shigemasa; Ushigome, Takuro; Eto, Ken; Okamoto, Tomoyoshi; Yanaga, Katsuhiko",Surgical endoscopy,389,27

The infected graylag geese showed lower body weights compared with virus-negative birds, suggesting clinical significance of the infection. Phylogenetic analyses performed on the replicase gene and nucleocapsid protein sequences, indicated that the novel coronaviruses described in the present study all branch off from group III coronaviruses. All the novel avian coronaviruses harboured the conserved s2m RNA structure in their 3' untranslated region, like other previously described group III coronaviruses, and like the SARS coronavirus. Sequencing of the complete nucleocapsid gene and downstream regions of goose and pigeon coronaviruses, evidenced the presence of two additional open reading frames for the goose coronavirus with no sequence similarity to known proteins, but with predicted transmembrane domains for one of the encoded proteins, and one additional open reading frame for the pigeon coronavirus, with a predicted transmembrane domain, downstream of the nucleocapsid gene.","Jonassen, Christine Monceyron; Kofstad, Tone; Larsen, Inger-Lise; Løvland, Atle; Handeland, Kjell; Follestad, Arne; Lillehaug, Atle",The Journal of general virology,389,6

METHODS The distribution of proximal femoral marrow on MR imaging of 148 health care workers with recovered SARS including 106 cases treated with varied dosage of steroids and 42 cases without steroid, and 97 age and sex matched health adults as controls were observed. The index of marrow conversion (signal intensity of the femoral neck and intertrochanteric area divided by signal intensity of the greater trochanter multiplied by 100%) was quantitatively measured and compared between SARS patients treated with steroid and without steroid and the normal control group. RESULTS In 106 cases treated with steroid of the 148 health care workers, femoral head osteonecrosis was found in 4 cases, bilateral femoral marrow edema in 2 cases, femoral marrow infarction in 1 case. The index of marrow conversion in the normal controls, in SARS patients treated without and with steroids was (79.4 +/- 6.8)%, (86.9 +/- 7.4)%, (88.6 +/- 5.9)%, respectively. There was significantly statistical difference between groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION In addition to fat conversion in the proximal femoral marrow due to steroid treatment, the infection of SARS itself may promote an excessively conversion of the red marrow to yellow marrow of the femoral neck in SARS patients.","Shen, Jun; Liang, Bi-ling; Zeng, Qing-si; Chen, Jian-yu; Liu, Qing-yu; Chen, Rong-chang; Zhong, Nan-shan",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,389,26

Using this envelope assembly assay, we have studied the primary sequence requirements for particle formation of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) M protein, the major protein of the coronavirion membrane. Our results show that each of the different domains of the protein is important. Mutations (deletions, insertions, point mutations) in the luminal domain, the transmembrane domains, the amphiphilic domain, or the carboxy-terminal domain had effects on the assembly of M into enveloped particles. Strikingly, the extreme carboxy-terminal residue is crucial. Deletion of this single residue abolished particle assembly almost completely; most substitutions were strongly inhibitory. Site-directed mutations in the carboxy terminus of M were also incorporated into the MHV genome by targeted recombination. The results supported a critical role for this domain of M in viral assembly, although the M carboxy terminus was more tolerant of alteration in the complete virion than in virus-like particles, likely because of the stabilization of virions by additional intermolecular interactions. Interestingly, glycosylation of M appeared not essential for assembly. Mutations in the luminal domain that abolished the normal O glycosylation of the protein or created an N-glycosylated form had no effect. Mutant M proteins unable to form virus-like particles were found to inhibit the budding of assembly-competent M in a concentration-dependent manner. However, assembly-competent M was able to rescue assembly-incompetent M when the latter was present in low amounts. These observations support the existence of interactions between M molecules that are thought to be the driving force in coronavirus envelope assembly.","de Haan, C A; Kuo, L; Masters, P S; Vennema, H; Rottier, P J",Journal of virology,389,16

METHODS An exclusion list for screening donor animals and graft tissue in Australia was compiled following evaluation of the disease risks posed by 121 organisms, including 36 bacteria, 12 fungi, four mycoplasma, 31 parasites and 38 viruses. The list of evaluated agents was derived from the literature, interviews with veterinarians and physicians, and a survey of laboratories. RESULTS The exclusion list contains 35 organisms (including 20 bacteria, four fungi, one mycoplasma, one parasite and nine viruses) that are zoonotic, pathogens of immunocompromised hosts (including human allograft recipients), pathogens resistant to antibiotics or potentially able to recombine with the human genome. These 35 agents can be detected by culture (e.g., Actinomyces), serological testing (e.g., influenza viruses) or nucleic acid amplification (e.g., Mycobacteria).

""",14.827862,5.8271585,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Mental health problems significantly increased worldwide during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. At the early stage of the outbreak, the government of Bangladesh imposed lockdown and quarantine approaches to prevent the spread of the virus, which impacted people's daily life and health. The COVID-19 pandemic has also affected people's economic status, healthcare facilities and other lifestyle factors in Bangladesh. We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among the Bangladeshi population. METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey among 672 Bangladeshi people aged between 15 and 65 years all over the country from 15 April to 10 May 2020. After obtaining electronic consent, we conducted a survey assessing people's sociodemographic profiles and psychometric measures. We used The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale-8, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to assess loneliness, depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance, respectively. RESULTS: The prevalence of loneliness, depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance was estimated at 71% (mild: 32%, moderate: 29%, severe: 10%), 38% (mild: 24%, moderate: 11%, severe: 3%), 64% (mild: 30%, moderate: 17%, severe: 17%) and 73% (mild: 50%, moderate: 18%, severe: 5%), respectively. In Bangladesh, the key factors associated with poor mental health during COVID-19 were female sex, unemployment, being a student, obesity and living without a family. The present study also identified statistically significant interrelationships among the measured mental health issues. CONCLUSIONS: A large portion of respondents reported mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The present study suggests longitudinal assessments of mental health among Bangladeshi people to determine the gravity of this issue during and after the pandemic. Appropriate supportive programmes and interventional approaches would address mental health problems in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Das, Rajesh; Hasan, Md Rakib; Daria, Sohel; Islam, Md Rabiul",BMJ Open,389,28

The disease modifying therapies in pwMS can add a more severe risk of infection when compared to the general population. Alemtuzumab is an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody and it is one of the most immunosuppressive drugs used in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). CASE DESCRIPTION: We present a case of Covid-19 infection that occurred in a 24-year-old woman with MS and treated with alemtuzumab. The infection occurred 4 months after administration of the first course of alemtuzumab and had a benign course with subsequent development of antibodies. Furthermore, we present a brief review of the literature on similar published cases. DISCUSSION: We reviewed 17 articles concerning COVID-19 infection in MS patients in treatment with Alemtuzumab. In our case and all screened cases no severe course of disease was noted and no fatality was observed. Systematic compilation of this observation comforts clinicians about the course of Covid-19 infection despite alemtuzumab immunosuppressive treatment CONCLUSIONS: The risk of serious COVID-19 disease in MS patients treated with alemtuzumab is unknown. Physicians need to monitor carefully pwMS treated with alemtuzumab and to consider COVID-19 infection related relapse in the MS patients. Further research is recommended to evaluate the beneficial-risk profile of alemtuzumab in pandemic era.","Iovino, Aniello; Olivieri, Nunzio; Aruta, Francesco; Giaquinto, Emanuele; Ruggiero, Lucia; Spina, Emanuele; Tozza, Stefano; Manganelli, Fiore; Iodice, Rosa",Mult Scler Relat Disord,389,33

METHODS: This was an observational study carried out in Turkey. An online semi-structured questionnaire was developed by using google forms and the link of the questionnaire was sent through emails, WhatsApp and other social media to the contacts of the investigators between 20th March 2020 and 25th March 2020. The questionnaire contained 21 questions and Beck anxiety scale. RESULTS: About 1070 people were included in the study. Approximately one-fifth of the participants had no idea about treatment and immunisation against COVID-19. According to the categorisation of Beck Anxiety Inventory scores 8.6% showed severe anxiety symptoms. Anxiety levels of women, healthcare workers and those with psychiatric illness were higher (P < .05). It was observed that women, healthcare professionals, those with chronic diseases and those with moderate to severe anxiety used the medical facemask more frequently (P < .05). About 73% of the participants thought that they fully implemented the proposed measures; 25.2% of them stated that population did not take any measures for the COVID-19. CONCLUSION: According to the results of the study individuals usually had better awareness and positive attitudes towards COVID-19 pandemic, but there were also things that needed improvement. The most important measure to be taken in order to prevent anxiety from increasing is to ensure the correct access of information and to establish psychological support lines.","Ayhan Baser, Duygu; Çevik, Murat; Gümüstakim, Sule; Basara, Ekrem",Int J Clin Pract,389,22

High-quality respiratory protection is essential to reduce exposure among healthcare workers, yet dire shortages of personal protective equipment in the United States threaten the health and safety of this essential workforce. In the context of rapidly changing conditions and incomplete data, this article outlines 3 important strategies to improve healthcare workers' respiratory protection. At a minimum, healthcare workers delivering care to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear N95 respirators and full-face shields. Several mechanisms exist to boost and protect the supply of N95 respirators, including rigorous decontamination protocols, invoking the Defense Production Act, expanded use of reusable elastomeric respirators, and repurposing industrial N95 respirators. Finally, homemade facial coverings do not protect healthcare workers and should be avoided. These strategies, coupled with longer-term strategies of investments in protective equipment research, infrastructure, and data systems, provide a framework to protect healthcare workers immediately and enhance preparedness efforts for future pandemics.","Friese, Christopher R; Veenema, Tener Goodwin; Johnson, James S; Jayaraman, Sundaresan; Chang, James C; Clever, Linda Hawes",Health Secur,389,16

The presentations of STEMI and covid-19 can overlap and mimic each other. Both conditions may coexist. Uncertainty regarding diagnosis may add to delays. Provider΄s concerns about the covid-19 infection or lack of cath lab staff may lead to changes in treatment algorhithms. There may also be delay due to the infection-control measures employed by medical staff. Reduction in non-covid care, overwhelmed emergency medical services and hospitals, staff-absences, and lack of beds may all lead to treatment delay or even inability to provide it. Inflammatory and prothrombotic states in patients with covid-19 increase the risk of developing STEMI as well as that of STEMI complications. Hypoxia due to covid-19 lung disease deepens myocardial ischemia during STEMI and may extend the volume of STEMI and increase the risk of heart failure. Covid myocarditis Conclusion: It is apparent that STEMI in covid-19 infected patients is not the same disease process as STEMI that without covid-19 infection. Patients with STEMI and covid-19 have a higher risk of heart failure, cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, greater intracoronary thrombosis and stent thrombosis, resulting in higher cardiac and non-cardiac mortality. Aggressive antithrombotic treatment is recommended. Even in the covid era it is essential to insist on timely treatment of STEMI. Training of cardiac catheterization personnel on how to use personal protective equipment as well as vaccination are crucial to limit the risk of acquiring infection.

Výskyt, průběh, léčbu a prognózu STEMI ovlivňuje covidová epidemie v několika aspektech:  Část nemocných z obavy před covidovou nákazou v nemocnici oddaluje přivolání zdravotnické pomoci, nebo dokonce pomoc vůbec nezavolá. Příznaky STEMI a covid-19 se mohou překrývat a vzájemně napodobovat, navíc mohou koexistovat, nejistota při stanovení diagnózy může vést ke zpoždění léčby. Obava z covidové nákazy zdravotníků nebo nedostatek personálu katetrizačních laboratoří může vést ke změně léčebných algoritmů. Přetížené zdravotní služby, omezení „necovidové“ péče, chybějící personál, nedostatek lůžek mohou mít za následek prodlevu v léčbě STEMI až nemožnost léčbu poskytnout. Použítí ochranných prostředků proti šíření covid-19 může vést ke zpoždění léčby. Zánětlivý a protrombotický stav během covidové infekce zvyšuje riziko vzniku infarktu myokardu a zvyšuje riziko trombotických komplikací již probíhajícího STEMI. Hypoxie způsobená covidovým postižením plic prohlubuje ischemii myokardu při AIM, může zvětšit rozsah infarktu a zvyšuje riziko srdečního selhání při AIM. Covidová myokarditida. Závěr: STEMI u nemocného s covid-19 není stejná nemoc jako STEMI bez covid-19. Nemocní s covid-19 a STEMI mají častěji srdeční selhání a srdeční zástavu, rozsáhlejší intrakoronární trombózu, významně vyšší riziko akutní trombózy stentu, kardiogenního šoku po PCI a významně vyšší nemocniční kardiální i nekardiální mortalitu. Je indikována agresivnější antitrombotická léčba. I v covidové době je nutná maximální snaha o co nejrychlejší zajištění reperfuzní léčby a dodržení časových limitů pro její provedení.

We also detected the level of interferon &#945; (IFN-&#945;) and interferon Î³ (IFN-Î³) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results showed that IPEC-J2 cells exhibited a clear pathological change after PEDV infection at 24 h. In addition, TLR7, TLR9 and TLR10 expressions were significantly upregulated in PEDV-infected IPEC-J2 cells at 24 h. Interestingly, the expression patterns of TLR2 and TLR4 were consistent at different stages of PEDV infection. The expression level of TLR3 decreased significantly with the increase of infection time, but the expression levels of TLR5 and TLR8 genes at 6 h and 12 h were significantly lower than those in the control group (p&#10216;0.01). There were significant correlations among the expression levels of TLR genes (p&#10216;0.05). Cytokine detection showed that the secretion level of IFN-&#945; in the PEDV-infected group was significantly higher than that in the control group (p&#10216;0.01), and IFN-Î³ at 6 h and 12 h after PEDV infection was significantly higher than that in control group (p&#10216;0.01). Therefore, our results suggest that PEDV infection can induce innate immune responses in intestinal porcine jejunum epithelial cells, leading to changes in the expression of Toll-like receptors, and can regulate the resistance to virus infection by affecting the release levels of downstream cytokines.","Wang, F; Wang, S Q; Wang, H F; Wu, Z C; Bao, W B; Wu, S L",Pol J Vet Sci,389,16

Our aim was to provide a detailed account of case characteristics, resource use, and outcomes of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Germany, where the health-care system has not been overwhelmed by the pandemic. METHODS: In this observational study, adult patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, who were admitted to hospital in Germany between Feb 26 and April 19, 2020, and for whom a complete hospital course was available (ie, the patient was discharged or died in hospital) were included in the study cohort. Claims data from the German Local Health Care Funds were analysed. The data set included detailed information on patient characteristics, duration of hospital stay, type and duration of ventilation, and survival status. Patients with adjacent completed hospital stays were grouped into one case. Patients were grouped according to whether or not they had received any form of mechanical ventilation. To account for comorbidities, we used the Charlson comorbidity index. FINDINGS: Of 10â021 hospitalised patients being treated in 920 different hospitals, 1727 (17%) received mechanical ventilation (of whom 422 [24%] were aged 18-59 years, 382 [22%] were aged 60-69 years, 535 [31%] were aged 70-79 years, and 388 [23%] were aged &#8805;80 years). The median age was 72 years (IQR 57-82). Men and women were equally represented in the non-ventilated group, whereas twice as many men than women were in the ventilated group. The likelihood of being ventilated was 12% for women (580 of 4822) and 22% for men (1147 of 5199). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (5575 [56%] of 10â021), diabetes (2791 [28%]), cardiac arrhythmia (2699 [27%]), renal failure (2287 [23%]), heart failure (1963 [20%]), and chronic pulmonary disease (1358 [14%]). Dialysis was required in 599 (6%) of all patients and in 469 (27%) of 1727 ventilated patients. The Charlson comorbidity index was 0 for 3237 (39%) of 8294 patients without ventilation, but only 374 (22%) of 1727 ventilated patients. The mean duration of ventilation was 13·5 days (SD 12·1). In-hospital mortality was 22% overall (2229 of 10 021), with wide variation between patients without ventilation (1323 [16%] of 8294) and with ventilation (906 [53%] of 1727; 65 [45%] of 145 for non-invasive ventilation only, 70 [50%] of 141 for non-invasive ventilation failure, and 696 [53%] of 1318 for invasive mechanical ventilation). In-hospital mortality in ventilated patients requiring dialysis was 73% (342 of 469). In-hospital mortality for patients with ventilation by age ranged from 28% (117 of 422) in patients aged 18-59 years to 72% (280 of 388) in patients aged 80 years or older. INTERPRETATION: In the German health-care system, in which hospital capacities have not been overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic, mortality has been high for patients receiving mechanical ventilation, particularly for patients aged 80 years or older and those requiring dialysis, and has been considerably lower for patients younger than 60 years.

This is a cross-sectional study of 955 students from four universities carried out via a web survey containing social, economic, demographic, and health information. A food frequency questionnaire was used to evaluate diet. Weight and dietary alterations were reported. Exploratory factor analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used as statistical analyses. The mean age was 26 and 53.7% of the students observed an increase in their weight. Four dietary patterns were identified: (1) a predominantly in natura pattern, (2) a pattern of processed and ultra-processed foods, (3) a protein-based pattern, and (4) an infusion-based pattern. It was observed that students having a darker skin colour (OR 1.8; CI 95% 1.3-2.6) and 19-29 years old and not being a health course student (OR 1.5; CI 95% 1.1-2.1) were associated with greater adhesion to the in natura pattern. Not engaging in physical activity was statistically associated with not adhering (OR 0.5; CI 95% 0.4-0.7) to that pattern. The university students who saw an alteration in their weight during the social distancing period studied presented a greater probability of consuming the processed and ultra-processed foods pattern (OR 1.8; CI 95% 1.2-2.6), while the men (OR 0.7; CI 95% 0.4-0.9) and those not engaging in physical activity (OR 0.7; CI 95% 0.5-0.9) presented less adhesion to that pattern. These findings indicate that social isolation affected the dietary intake of university students, with adhesion to mixed dietary patterns in terms of health. The adhesion to the pattern of processed and ultra-processed foods identified may affect the students' health, especially the occurrence of excess weight and obesity.","Santana, Jerusa da Mota; Milagres, Maria Patricia; Silva Dos Santos, Caroline; Brazil, Jamille Marinho; Lima, Evely Rocha; Pereira, Marcos",Appetite,389,20

Prison governance and management under such circumstances have facilitated the revelation of existing mechanisms of control. Focusing on the experience of frontline officers, this paper explores how the Chinese prison system contained the spread of COVID-19 inside its walls by demanding officers work on 'lockdown shifts', and what we can learn about its governing logic. Multi-sourced data is utilized, including government-issued policies and reports, media reports, blog posts written by prison officers and participant observation as well as semi-structured interviews with frontline prison officers. This study offers a diachronic analysis of pandemic control within the prison system, focusing on key turning points. By examining frontline prison officers' accounts through first- and second-hand data, the study explores the execution of control policies and how they affect individual lives. The study found that prison officers were ordered to fight at the forefront of pandemic control in prisons by working on shifts inside for an extended and indefinite period of time, which proved effective in terminating the spread of the virus, but placed a heavy burden on the personal lives of the officers. The findings also reveal new facets in the mobility and experience of frontline officers. While effective in terms of what the statistics have demonstrated, the Chinese measures have been less effective in adjusting to the needs of frontline staff and acknowledging the personal sacrifices demanded and made in this process.","Zhang, Xiaoye; Wang, Lanrui",Asian J Criminol,389,32

Georgia announced a state-wide shelter-in-place on April 2 and partially lifted restrictions on April 27. We estimated the time-varying reproduction numbers (Rt) of COVID-19 in Georgia, Metro Atlanta, and Dougherty County and environs from March 2, 2020, to November 20, 2020. METHODS: We analyzed the daily incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Georgia, Metro Atlanta, and Dougherty County and its surrounding counties, and estimated Rt using the R package EpiEstim. We used a 9-day correction for the date of report to analyze the data by assumed date of infection. RESULTS: The median Rt estimate in Georgia dropped from between 2 and 4 in mid-March to < 2 in late March to around 1 from mid-April to November. Regarding Metro Atlanta, Rt fluctuated above 1.5 in March and around 1 since April. In Dougherty County, the median Rt declined from around 2 in late March to 0.32 on April 26. Then, Rt fluctuated around 1 in May through November. Counties surrounding Dougherty County registered an increase in Rt estimates days after a superspreading event occurred in the area. CONCLUSIONS: In Spring 2020, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 transmission in Georgia declined likely because of social distancing measures. However, because restrictions were relaxed in late April and elections were conducted in November, community transmission continued, with Rt fluctuating around 1 across Georgia, Metro Atlanta, and Dougherty County as of November 2020. The superspreading event in Dougherty County affected surrounding areas, indicating the possibility of local transmission in neighboring counties.","Muniz-Rodriguez, Kamalich; Chowell, Gerardo; Schwind, Jessica S; Ford, Randall; Ofori, Sylvia K; Ogwara, Chigozie A; Davies, Margaret R; Jacobs, Terrence; Cheung, Chi-Hin; Cowan, Logan T; Hansen, Andrew R; Chun-Hai Fung, Isaac",Perm. j.

PURPOSE: To explore pharmacy learner (eg, resident, fellow) and educator (eg, residency program director, preceptor) experiences and lessons learned during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: In May 2020, attendees of the virtual Research in Education and Practice Symposium (REPS) were invited to participate in two 1-hour networking sessions. During these sessions, participants completed individual and group reflection exercises during which they were asked questions about their experiences during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants who volunteered submitted their responses through an electronic survey application. Anonymous responses were coded using thematic analysis to address the research questions. RESULTS: Sixty-eight and 38 participants, respectively, attended the 2 networking discussions. Participant-identified professional impacts of the COVID-19 crisis included unexpected learning experiences, greater adaptability, workflow and learning interruptions, and decreased productivity. Personal impacts included a greater focus on well-being, physical and social isolation, and changes in travel plans. Participants noted positive and negative emotions including acceptance, encouragement, anxiety, stress, and frustration. The main lessons learned focused on adaptability, gratitude, and empathy. Participants indicated that they would have from foreknowledge of the anticipated duration of the pandemic, associated workflow changes, and the reliance on technology the pandemic would engender. In addition, they predicted that pharmacy practice will require changes to workflow flexibility, training expectations, the pharmacist's role, and organizational structure. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has positively and negatively impacted the professional and personal lives of pharmacy learners and educators, with the most notable impacts being in the areas of well-being and adaptability. Future research should explore the experiences of other workforce personnel and evaluate the long-term impact on pharmacy practice, patient outcomes, and workforce well-being and resiliency.","Sasser, Caroline Welles; Wolcott, Michael D; Morbitzer, Kathryn A; Eckel, Stephen F",Am. j. health system pharm,389,16

These circumstances presented many challenges for higher education faculty and students around the world but especially for nursing education programs which are traditionally conducted in a face-to-face learning environment that includes hands-on experiential learning. METHODS: Guided by Meleis' Transition Theory, a qualitative descriptive design was utilized to explore prelicensure nursing students' experiences of the transition to remote learning during the Spring 2020 semester. Participants were recruited from one baccalaureate program in the Pacific Northwestern United States. Interviews were conducted and transcribed using a web conferencing platform. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi's phenomenological reduction. RESULTS: Eleven students participated. Interviews revealed four overarching themes: technological challenges, academic relationship changes, role stress and strain, and resilience. CONCLUSION: The sudden transition to remote learning resulted in a number of challenges for nursing students. Despite these challenges, students demonstrated a remarkable sense of resilience and perseverance. Faculty have an opportunity to address student stressors and design remote courses in such a way to facilitate student engagement and community building.","Wallace, Sharon; Schuler, Monika S; Kaulback, Michelle; Hunt, Karen; Baker, Manisa",Nurs. forum,389,16

Métodos Se utilizó un modelo determinista compartimental SEIR considerando los estados: susceptibles (S), expuestos (E), infectados (I) y recuperados (R). Los parámetros del modelo fueron seleccionados de acuerdo a la revisión de literatura. En el caso de la tasa de letalidad, se usaron los datos de la Secretaría de Salud Municipal de Cali. Se plantearon varios escenarios teniendo en cuenta variaciones en el número básico de reproducción (R0) y en la tasa de letalidad; además, se comparó la predicción hasta el 9 de abril con los datos observados. Resultados A través del modelo SEIR se encontró que, con el número básico de reproducción más alto (2,6) y utilizando la letalidad calculada para la ciudad de 2,0%, el número máximo de casos se alcanzaría el primero de junio con 195 666 (prevalencia); sin embargo, al comparar los casos observados con los esperados, al inicio la ocurrencia observada estaba por encima de la proyectada; pero luego cambia la tendencia con una disminución marcada de la pendiente.

Due to the heterogeneity of ACHD and secondary complications, risk profiles are, however, not uniform. This document aims to give an overview of relevant data and outline our pragmatic approach to disease prevention and management. Based on anatomy and additional physiological factors including symptoms, exercise capacity, heart failure, pulmonary hypertension and cyanosis, we propose a pragmatic approach to categorising patients into low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk groups. We regard especially patients with complex cyanotic conditions, those with palliated univentricular hearts, heart failure, severe valvular disease or pulmonary hypertension as high-risk patients. To avoid infection, we recommend self-isolation and exemption from work for these cohorts. Infected ACHD patients with low or moderate risk and without signs of deterioration may be remotely followed and cared for at home while in self isolation. High-risk patients or those with signs of respiratory or cardiovascular impairment require admission ideally at a tertiary ACHD centre. Especially patients with complex, cyanotic disease, heart failure and arrhythmias require particular attention. Treatment in patients with cyanotic heart disease should be guided by the relative degree of desaturation compared with baseline and lactate levels rather than absolute oxygen saturation levels. Patients with right heart dilatation or dysfunction are potentially at increased risk of right heart failure as mechanical ventilation and acute respiratory distress syndrome can lead to increase in pulmonary arterial pressures.","Radke, Robert M; Frenzel, Tim; Baumgartner, Helmut; Diller, Gerhard-Paul",Heart,389,24

The effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on antibiotic dosing requirements is uncertain. We aimed to determine the effect of COVID-19 on ß-lactam pharmacokinetics (PK) and PK target attainment in critically ill patients with a personalized dosing strategy.Retrospective, single-center analysis of COVID-19â± critically ill patients with pneumonia (community-acquired pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia) who received continuous infusion of a ß-lactam antibiotic with dosing personalized through dosing software and therapeutic drug monitoring. A therapeutic exposure was defined as serum concentration between (css) 4 to 8 times the EUCAST non-species related breakpoint).Data from 58 patients with pneumonia was analyzed. Nineteen patients were tested COVID-19-positive before the start of the antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia. Therapeutic exposure was achieved in 71% of COVID-19 patients (68% considering all patients). All patients demonstrated css above the non-species-related breakpoint. Twenty percent exceeded css above the target range (24% of all patients). The median ß-lactam clearance was 49% compared to ß-lactam clearance in a standard patient without a significant difference regarding antibiotic, time of sampling or present COVID-19 infection. Median daily doses were 50% lower compared to standard bolus dosing.COVID-19 did not significantly affect ß-lactam pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients. Personalized ß-lactam dosing strategies were safe in critically ill patients and lead to high PK target attainment with less resources.","Chiriac, Ute; Frey, Otto R; Roehr, Anka C; Koeberer, Andreas; Gronau, Patrick; Fuchs, Thomas; Roberts, Jason A; Brinkmann, Alexander",Medicine (Baltimore),389,16

More than 60 VOCs were determined from 850 samples collected from four sites in and around the complexes through a 2-year monitoring campaign from 2005 to 2007. The VOCs of particular concern found in the area were benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, trichloroethylene, and formaldehyde, given their toxicity, concentration, and detection frequency. Toluene was the most abundant one. The VOC concentration rankings were consistent with their emission rankings. Most VOCs had higher concentrations at the industrial sites than at residential sites, indicating a significant impact of industrial emissions. The ambient levels of benzene and formaldehyde were additionally affected by vehicular emissions and secondary formation, respectively. Overall, the VOC levels increased in winter and at night, because of the local weather conditions. In contrast, the formaldehyde concentration increased in summer, owing to its secondary formation in the atmosphere. The ambient VOC levels in Sihwa-Banwol were higher than those in other parts of Korea. Additionally, the cumulative cancer risks posed by the toxic VOCs exceeded a tolerable risk level of 1 × 10-4 in not only the industrial areas but also the residential areas. The sum of the non-cancer risks in both areas significantly exceeded the threshold criterion of 1. The large amounts of aromatic compounds emitted from the industrial complexes are believed to play a crucial role in the elevated levels of surface ozone in the Seoul metropolitan area during the summer season. Therefore, comprehensive measures for controlling the VOC emissions in the Sihwa-Banwol area need to be prioritized to reduce the health risks for residents of not only this area but also the capital Seoul and its surrounding areas.","Kim, Min-Ji; Seo, Young-Kyo; Kim, Jong-Ho; Baek, Sung-Ok",,389,8

Other than vaccination, effective public health measures (including contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine) are critical for deterring viral transmission, preventing infection progression, and resuming normal activities. Viral transmission is affected by many factors, but the viral load and vitality could be among the most important ones. Although in vitro studies have indicated that the amount of virus isolated from infected people affects the successful rate of virus isolation, whether the viral load carried at the individual level would determine the transmissibility was unknown. We aimed to examine, from a diagnostic point of view, whether the cycle threshold (Ct) value, a measurement of viral load by RT-PCR assay, could differentiate the spreaders from the nonspreaders in a population of college students. Our results indicate that although at the population level the Ct value is lower (suggesting a higher viral load) in the symptomatic spreaders than in the asymptomatic nonspreaders, there is significant overlap in the Ct values between the two groups. Thus, the Ct value, or the viral load, at the individual level could not predict transmissibility. Our studies also suggest that a sensitive method to detect the presence of virus is needed to identify asymptomatic persons who may carry a low viral load but can still be infectious.","Tian, Di; Lin, Zhen; Kriner, Ellie M; Esneault, Dalton J; Tran, Jonathan; DeVoto, Julia C; Okami, Naima; Greenberg, Rachel; Yanofsky, Sarah; Ratnayaka, Swarnamala; Tran, Nicholas; Livaccari, Maeghan; Lampp, Marla; Wang, Noel; Tim, Scott; Norton, Patrick; Scott, John; Hu, Tony Y; Garry, Robert; Hamm, Lee; Delafontaine, Patrice; Yin, Xiao-Ming",J. mol. diagn,389,26

We aimed to describe the incidence, risk factors and outcomes for infection in these patients in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We used linked data sets to compare disease characteristics and mortality between patients receiving long-term dialysis in Ontario who were diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 positive and those who did not acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection, between Mar. 12 and Aug. 20, 2020. We collected data on SARS-CoV-2 infection prospectively. We evaluated risk factors for infection and death using multivariable logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: During the study period, 187 (1.5%) of 12 501 patients undergoing dialysis were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 117 (62.6%) were admitted to hospital and the case fatality rate was 28.3%. Significant predictors of infection included in-centre hemodialysis versus home dialysis (odds ratio [OR] 2.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59-4.05), living in a long-term care residence (OR 7.67, 95% CI 5.30-11.11), living in the Greater Toronto Area (OR 3.27, 95% CI 2.21-4.80), Black ethnicity (OR 3.05, 95% CI 1.95-4.77), Indian subcontinent ethnicity (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.02-2.81), other non-White ethnicities (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.38-2.97) and lower income quintiles (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.15-2.89).

On the other hand, as COVID-19 keeps on spreading, the popularization of cross-border mobile payment can lower the risk of infection caused by cash payment of tourists. However, though previous researchers already examined mobile payment users’ behavioral intention from different perspectives, these research findings tend to concentrate on the non-cross-border section of mobile payment. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to examine factors influencing cross-border mobile payment use intention from the user perspective, and combining three theoretical models, chiefly UTAUT2 (extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology), ITM (initial trust model), and TTF (task technology fit). In this research, 786 Chinese with the experience of using cross-border mobile payment while traveling to South Korea are adopted as respondents, and the structural equation model is used to empirically analyze the data of these research samples. The study found that initial trust, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, price value, task technology fit, and initial trust have significant effects on use intention.

In the first part, it presents the author's CKSK method, measuring whether and how Catholics listen to sermons from a theological and psychological point of view. The study was conducted on 130 people aged 16-92 years, in three Roman Catholic churches, in natural conditions, non-experimental. The research on the audience of sermons shows that Catholics usually listen to sermons in a fragmentary, medium-attentive way. The results indicate that the listenability of sermons is gender independent. It does not depend also on whether the parish is urban or rural, so it depends on other features and factors. However, listening to sermons varies from one age group to another. The study confirmed also the lack of correspondence between the declared listenability of sermons and their actual listening; only 7.84% of the variance of the declared listenability of sermons is explained by the variance of the actual listening to sermons.","Noworol Ov, Anna Maria; Ostafinski, Witold",,389,24

This was a retrospective study in a tertiary care center conducted through the period between March 2020 and November 2020 and included all adult patients with rheumatic diseases who tested positive on the COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. We assessed the patients' demographic data, history of rheumatic disease, COVID-19 symptoms and experimental treatment, if any, their disease course, and outcome. In all, 47 patients were included, and most were females. The commonest rheumatic diseases were rheumatoid arthritis (53.2%), followed by systemic lupus erythematosus (21.3%), and psoriatic arthritis (10.6%). Methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine were the most commonly used disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in 36.1% and 25.5%, respectively. Out of 47 patients, 48.9% required hospitalization with a median hospital stay of 7 days. Severe COVID-19 pneumonia, defined as clinical signs of pneumonia plus one of the following: respiratory rate > 30 bpm, severe respiratory distress, or oxygen saturation < 90% in room air was observed in 19.1% of the patients, and one patient died. We found that elderly patients with a mean age of 65.3 years were more likely to develop severe COVID-19 pneumonia and that was statistically significant. Our study showed that elderly patients with a mean age of 65 years and having rheumatic diseases had an increased risk of hospital admission and development of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.","Alzahrani, Zeyad A; Alghamdi, Khalid Abdullah; Almaqati, Ahmed Saeed",Rheumatol Int,389,3

Design/methodology/approach: A descriptive survey research design was used for this study. A total of 1,200 social media users, regardless of their professions, were randomly selected for the study betweenmid-June and July 2020. Stratified and purposive sampling techniques were used for this study. The questionnaire was designed using Google form and administered using WhatsApp and Telegram to social media users above 18 years old in Nigeria. The data generated was analyzed using descriptive (frequency count) and inferential (mean) statistics, and was presented in tables. Findings: It was found that people make use of social media during COVID-19 pandemic for diverse reasons such as listening to announcement to be informed, knowing the necessary measures to take by those infected and spreading up-to-date information on the pandemic. Social media tools were highly used during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially WhatsApp and Zoom. Findings reflected that misinformation was spread on social media. This study also showed that the infodemic associated with COVID-19 is managed by confirming the source of the information before sharing it and trusting information from reliable sources. Research limitations/implications: The result of this research will contribute to the body of knowledge on social media application, fake news and the spread of COVID-19 infodemic in Nigeria and beyond. Practical implications: Infodemic is a disaster in the health sector. The spread of infodemic is capable of misleading people, losing trust in government, health providers and health regulatory authorities. This study will help social media users to know how to properly manage social media infodemic during a pandemic or any health-related situations. Originality/value: This study is novel as it approaches fake news from a COVID-19 perspective. Very few articles emanate from the developing countries in this area. This was because most of the narrative around fake news previously centered around the Western occurrences such as the Iraqi invasion by the USA, the US presidential elections and BREXIT.

This model of development of the IT sector of Ukraine is due, in particular, to the low efficiency of competitiveness management technologies used by IT companies. The latter actualizes the development of adequate mechanisms for managing the competitiveness of companies in the IT sector of Ukraine. The purpose of the paper is to develop the theory and procedural guidelines for the formation of assessment and forecasting of the level of competitiveness of companies in the IT sector. The works in the field of cognitive management, cognitive control, adaptive management, proactive management, competitiveness management are the theoretical-methodological basis of the paper. The assessment and forecasting of the state of the environment of 20 IT companies of Ukraine were carried out, the inertial scenario of their development was created, and forecasting of threats to sustainable operation of the companies was carried out. Comparison of the current and forecast level of competitiveness allowed to assess the stability of competitive positions of the companies, to identify the IT companies, for which it is advisable to develop proactive strategies aimed at reversing the negative trends, which are formed according to forecast data on the accepted competitiveness management strategy. It was demonstrated that the negative consequences of the ""shock"" of COVID-19 (in particular, 61 of the 68 largest companies in the IT sector (90 %) included in the S & P500 index are characterized by negative market value dynamics) lead to the need to consider adaptive strategy as a focus strategy.","Fedorenko, V.; Filipenko, N.; Shumilo, I.; Nesterovych, V.; Nischymna, S.",Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Issues,389,22

Numerous clinical trials are being reviewed for use of different drugs, biologics, and vaccines in COVID-19. A much empirical approach will be to repurpose existing drugs for which pharmacokinetic and safety data are available, because this will facilitate the process of drug development. The article discusses the evidence available for the use of Ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug with antiviral properties, in COVID-19. METHODS: A rational review of the drugs was carried out utilizing their clinically significant attributes. A more thorough understanding was met by virtual embodiment of the drug structure and realizable viral targets using artificial intelligence (AI)-based and molecular dynamics (MD)-simulation-based study. CONCLUSION: Certain studies have highlighted the significance of ivermectin in COVID-19; however, it requires evidences from more Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) and dose- response studies to support its use. In silico-based analysis of ivermectin's molecular interaction specificity using AI and classical mechanics simulation-based methods indicates positive interaction of ivermectin with viral protein targets, which is leading for SARS-CoV 2 N-protein NTD (nucleocapsid protein N-terminal domain).","Kaur, Harpinder; Shekhar, Nishant; Sharma, Saurabh; Sarma, Phulen; Prakash, Ajay; Medhi, Bikash",Pharmacol. rep,389,32

COVID-19 is a viral respiratory tract disease that poses an increasing risk of infection through person-to-person transmission in a confined space or close proximity to an infected person. It is thus crucial to maintain a sufficiently safe distance from others during leisure activities. In this study, measures concerning leisure activity spaces and the current status of leisure activities were investigated. Data were gathered from a total of 1078 participants via an online survey conducted from 26 to 29 October 2020. Frequency analysis was performed to investigate the sample characteristics and exploratory factor analysis was performed to analyze the validity of the measurement tools. Results revealed that people's perceived crowding of leisure activity spaces directly influenced their participation in leisure activities. Regarding age, those in their 20s were more aware of congestion and their risk perception was higher than those in their 40s and 50s. It was found that people perceived cultural and artistic activities to be dangerous as they often take place as part of tourism and leisure activities and amidst crowds. However, their high-risk perception indirectly influenced their participation patterns, making it difficult to enjoy leisure activities. To lower the risk perception of leisure activity spaces, it was necessary to secure more safe distancing than current regulations require. Future research must conduct a longitudinal investigation by objectively stratifying the degree of perceived crowding.","Kim, Young-Jae; Kang, Seung-Woo",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),389,16

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic people is an urgent priority for the prevention and containment of disease outbreaks in communities. However, few data are available in asymptomatic persons regarding the accuracy of PCR testing. Additionally, although self-collected saliva has significant logistical advantages in mass screening, its utility as an alternative specimen in asymptomatic persons is yet to be determined. METHODS: We conducted a mass-screening study to compare the utility of nucleic acid amplification, such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, using nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva samples from each individual in two cohorts of asymptomatic persons: the contact tracing cohort and the airport quarantine cohort. RESULTS: In this mass-screening study including 1,924 individuals, the sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification testing with nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens were 86% (90%CI:77-93%) and 92% (90%CI:83-97%), respectively, with specificities greater than 99.9%. The true concordance probability between the nasopharyngeal and saliva tests was estimated at 0.998 (90%CI:0.996-0.999) on the estimated airport prevalence at 0.3%. In positive individuals, viral load was highly correlated between NPS and saliva. CONCLUSION: Both nasopharyngeal and saliva specimens had high sensitivity and specificity. Self-collected saliva is a valuable specimen to detect SARS-CoV-2 in mass screening of asymptomatic persons.","Yokota, Isao; Shane, Peter Y; Okada, Kazufumi; Unoki, Yoko; Yang, Yichi; Inao, Tasuku; Sakamaki, Kentaro; Iwasaki, Sumio; Hayasaka, Kasumi; Sugita, Junichi; Nishida, Mutsumi; Fujisawa, Shinichi; Teshima, Takanori",Clin. infect. dis,389,1

The change to prone position is generally accompanied by a marked improvement in arterial blood gases, which is mainly due to a better overall ventilation/perfusion matching. Improvement in oxygenation and reduction in mortality are the main reasons to implement prone position in patients with ARDS. The main reason explaining a decreased mortality is less overdistension in non-dependent lung regions and less cyclical opening and closing in dependent lung regions. The only absolute contraindication for implementing prone position is an unstable spinal fracture. The maneuver to change from supine to prone and vice versa requires a skilled team of 4-5 caregivers. The most frequent adverse events are pressure sores and facial edema. Recently, the use of prone position has been extended to non-intubated spontaneously breathing patients affected with COVID-19 ARDS.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to develop and apply a methodology for evaluating the identity disclosure risks of fully synthetic data. METHODS: A full risk model is presented, which evaluates both identity disclosure and the ability of an adversary to learn something new if there is a match between a synthetic record and a real person. We term this ""meaningful identity disclosure risk."" The model is applied on samples from the Washington State Hospital discharge database (2007) and the Canadian COVID-19 cases database. Both of these datasets were synthesized using a sequential decision tree process commonly used to synthesize health and social science data. RESULTS: The meaningful identity disclosure risk for both of these synthesized samples was below the commonly used 0.09 risk threshold (0.0198 and 0.0086, respectively), and 4 times and 5 times lower than the risk values for the original datasets, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We have presented a comprehensive identity disclosure risk model for fully synthetic data. The results for this synthesis method on 2 datasets demonstrate that synthesis can reduce meaningful identity disclosure risks considerably. The risk model can be applied in the future to evaluate the privacy of fully synthetic data.","El Emam, Khaled; Mosquera, Lucy; Bass, Jason",J Med Internet Res,389,16

The aim of this study was to understand the level of depression as a result of the COVID-19 situation and possible associations with sociodemographic variables. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: It's a cross-sectional study. The participants were 155 respondents recruited online in the period 27.04.2020 until 05.06.2020, who completed the Albanian version of PHQ-9. RESULTS: Mean score of depression resulted 10.94 (SD=9.22). 63% of participants agreed that the situation has worsened their psychological state; 35.6% had a mild to severe form of depression and 18.7% had minimal symptoms. 13.4% of participants saw iCBT as helpful, 16.8% a little while 65.8% wanted to try it. Significantly higher depression resulted for females and age-group 18 to 24 years. No significant differences by levels of education, marital status, employment, socio-economic status and by expectations regarding iCBT. Gender and perception of worsened psychological state showed predictive abilities for depression. CONCLUSION: The situation with Covid-19 has increased depression levels especially among females and 18 to 24 years old and thus expectations for e-psychotherapy.

Since the disorder is self-limiting, it is frequently underdiagnosed. However, the disease should not be overlooked since the associated thyrotoxicosis may worsen the clinical course of concomitant disorders (e.g., respiratory distress) and long-term sequelae, such as autoimmune hypothyroidism, have been reported. METHODS: Here we describe a woman who developed SAT with thyrotoxicosis after SARS-COV-2 infection. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) symptoms were mild and the patient was managed with no specific treatment and recovered rapidly. RESULTS: Six weeks after the onset of the upper respiratory tract infection, the patient developed pain and tenderness in the anterior cervical region, fatigue, tremors, and palpitations. Physical examination revealed mild tremors of the extremities, a diffuse and painful goiter, and enlarged and tender cervical and submandibular lymph nodes. At biochemical evaluation, TSH was suppressed, FT3 and FT4 were high, and serum thyroglobulin was markedly increased (188 pg/mL; n.v. 0-40). Thyroid scintigraphy showed markedly reduced 99mTc-perthecnetate uptake in the gland. All findings were consistent with SAT, and treatment with oral prednisone (25 mg/day as the starting dose, gradually tapered) was started. Under the corticosteroid therapy, there was progressive resolution of symptoms and signs, and, within 4 weeks, all thyroid functional tests and inflammatory indexes normalized. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should be aware of thyroid manifestations potentially associated with COVID-19.","Ruggeri, Rosaria Maddalena; Campennì, Alfredo; Siracusa, Massimiliano; Frazzetto, Giuseppe; Gullo, Damiano",Hormones (Athens),389,26

The Wuhan shutdown was associated with the delayed arrival of COVID-19 in other cities by 2.91 days. Cities that implemented control measures preemptively reported fewer cases on average (13.0) in the first week of their outbreaks compared with cities that started control later (20.6). Suspending intracity public transport, closing entertainment venues, and banning public gatherings were associated with reductions in case incidence.

CP donors with non-detectable levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in their serum were characterized by higher Th9 and Th17 cells, which were possibly expanded at the expense of Th2 humoral immunity. The most noticeable alterations were identified in previously hospitalized CP donors, who presented the lowest levels of CD8+ regulatory T cells, the highest levels of CD56+CD16- NKT cells, and a promotion of a Th17-type phenotype, which might be associated with a prolonged pro-inflammatory response.

In an attempt to assess the emerging mutants of SARS-CoV-2 and determine their spread in India, we analysed 112 complete genomes of SARS-CoV-2 in a time-lapse manner. We found 72 distinct SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes, defined by 143 polymorphic sites and high haplotype diversity, suggesting that this virus possesses a high evolutionary potential. We also demonstrated that early introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into India was from China, Italy and Iran and observed signs of community spread of the virus following its rapid demographic expansion since its first outbreak in the country. Additionally, we identified 18 mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and a few selected mutations showed to increase stability, binding affinity, and molecular flexibility in the overall tertiary structure of the protein that may facilitate interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The study provides a pragmatic view of haplotype-dependent spread of SARS-CoV-2 in India which could be important in tailoring the pharmacologic treatments to be more effective for those infected with the most common haplotypes. The findings based on the time-lapse sentinel surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 will aid in the development of a real-time practical framework to tackle the ongoing, fast-evolving epidemic challenges in the country.","Thakur, Mukesh; Singh, Abhishek; Joshi, Bheem Dutt; Ghosh, Avijit; Singh, Sujeet Kumar; Singh, Neha; Sharma, Lalit Kumar; Chandra, Kailash",PLoS One,389,20

236159,236159,236159,Letter from the Editor,15.128528,5.740577,2021,"Context: Early diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and patient isolation are important for both individual patient care and disease containment. The diagnosis is confirmed by testing for the presence of nasopharyngeal viral RNA with a polymerase chain reaction assay, which has limited availability, variable turnaround time, and a high false-negative rate. The authors report that a rapid laboratory test, the eosinophil count, readily obtained from a routine complete blood cell count (CBC), may provide actionable clinical information to aid in the early recognition of COVID-19 in patients, as well as provide prognostic information. Objective: To investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of eosinopenia in COVID-19-positive patients. Methods: The eosinophil results of routine CBC from the first 50 admitted COVID-19-positive patients were compared with the eosinophil results of 50 patients with confirmed influenza infection at the time of presentation to the emergency department at Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn, New York. The number of patients with 0 eosinophils on the day of presentation was also compared between the 2 groups. Furthermore, the eosinophil counts in the 50 COVID-19 patients were reviewed for the first 5 days of their hospital stay and before discharge, along with the outcome (deceased vs discharged), and trends in eosinophil data were compared based on the outcome. Results: On the day of presentation, 30 patients in the COVID-19 group (60%) and 8 patients in the influenza group (16%) had an eosinophil count of 0. An additional 14 patients in the COVID-19 group had 0 eosinophils during the following 2 days; the total number of patients in the COVID-19 group who had 0 eosinophils on admission or during the ensuing 2 days was 44 (88%). In addition, 18 of 21 deceased patients in the COVID-19 group (86%) who initially presented with eosinopenia remained eosinopenic compared with 13 of 26 survivors (50%). Conclusion: The absence of an eosinophil count in a CBC can aid in early diagnosis of COVID-19. It may be a useful tool in deciding whether to promptly isolate a patient and initiate specific therapies while waiting for confirmatory test results. Persistent eosinopenia after admission correlated with high disease severity and low rates of recovery.","Tanni, Fahmina; Akker, Eleonora; Zaman, Muhammad M; Figueroa, Nilka; Tharian, Biju; Hupart, Kenneth H",J.

Outpatient care and dental care were limited to telephone advice and emergency services. Dental staff is particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 contraction, because of the inevitable contact with patients' body fluids during aerosol-generating procedures. The implementation of diagnostic tests among ambulatory patients could improve the occupational safety among outpatient care personnel. The aim of this review was to introduce information regarding COVID-19 diagnostics with a particular focus on the methods which can be utilized in an outpatient and dental care setting. An online PubMed database review of articles on COVID-19 diagnostics, published on February 12-May 15, 2020, was conducted. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is the gold standard in COVID-19 diagnostics, which determines if a person has an active infection. Unfortunately, its utilization in outpatient care is limited. Serological enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays identify people who were infected, including those who have had an asymptomatic infection, but they do not give sufficient information about the acute infection. Rapid serological assays developed to facilitate testing outside of laboratories, especially in dental offices, are not recommended by the World Health Organization to be used outside research settings, and they should not constitute the basis for clinical decision-making because of frequent false-negative results which may consequently contribute to personnel infections. Out of all available COVID-19 diagnostic methods, rapid serological assays seemed to be a method of choice in outpatient medical care. Unfortunately, their results turned out to be unreliable. The best methods to ensure the occupational safety of medical staff and to avoid cross-infections in outpatient care facilities include a thorough epidemiological interview, temperature measurement to rule out patients with an active infection, and the implementation of strict infection control procedures.

Descriptive analysis was performed to provide summary statistics of the frequencies of tweets related to different dental treatment needs and also the differences in volume content between the years 2019 and 2020. Moreover, the data were analyzed by qualitative analysis using an inductive approach. A total of 1,763 tweets from 2020 and 1,339 tweets from 2019 were screened. Those tweets posted by non-Brazilian users, duplicates, and those unrelated to dental treatment needs were removed and, therefore 1,197 tweets from 2020 and 719 tweets from 2019 were selected. Content volume related to dental treatment needs greatly increased during the COVID-19 outbreak. Findings from the word cloud and content analysis suggest that dental pain, related or not to the third molar, and problems with orthodontic appliances were the topics most commonly related to dental treatment needs discussed during the COVID-19 outbreak, mainly conveying anxiety and distress. The volume of tweets related to dental treatment needs posted by Brazilian users increased during the COVID-19 outbreak and self-reported pain and urgencies were the most popular topics.","Oliveira, Leandro Machado; Zanatta, Fabrício Batistin",Braz Oral Res,389,2

This is a multi-phase observatory study conducted in the SG Moscati Hospital of Taranto in Italy that was converted into COVID-19 Special Care Unit for SARS-Co-V2 risk management. Patients were admitted to the 118 Emergency Pre-Hospital and Emergency Department based on two diagnostic criteria, the nasopharyngeal swab assessed by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) and CT-scan image characterized by ground glass opacity. Patients were divided into four groups, positive-positive (ER-PP), negative-positive (ER-NP), negative-negative (ER-NN) and a group admitted to the ICU (ER-IC). A further control group was added when the T and B lymphocyte subsets were analyzed. Data included gender, age, vital signs, arterial blood gas analysis (ABG), extensive laboratory results with microbiology and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) which were analyzed and compared. Fundamental differences were reported among the groups.

Mean and standard deviation were used to represent continuous variables while we used frequencies and percentages to represent categorical variables. The Kruskal-Wallis H test was used for continuous variables since they were not normally distributed. Moreover, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rho) was used to determine the relationship between different variables. There was a significantly positive correlation between the vaccine coverage (%) and both of total cases per one million populations (rho = 0.37; p-value < 0.001) and deaths per one million populations (rho = 0.30; p-value < 0.001).

Due to chronic inflammation, COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) or renal disease (RD) have more severe symptoms and higher mortality. However, the factors that contribute to severe outcomes of COVID-19 patients with DM and RD have received little attention. In an effort to investigate potential treatments for COVID-19, recent research has focused on the immunomodulation functions of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In this study, the correlation between DM and RD and the severity of COVID-19 was examined by a combined approach with a meta-analysis and experimental research. The results of a systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that the odd of mortality in patients with both DM and RD was increased in comparison to those with a single comorbidity. In addition, in the experimental research, the data showed that high glucose and uremic toxins contributed to the induction of cytokine storm in human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (Calu-3 cells) in response to SARS-CoV Peptide Pools. Of note, the incorporation of Wharton's jelly MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (WJ-EVs) into SARS-CoV peptide-induced Calu-3 resulted in a significant decrease in nuclear NF-&#954;B p65 and the downregulation of the cytokine storm under high concentrations of glucose and uremic toxins. This clearly suggests the potential for WJ-EVs to reduce cytokine storm reactions in patients with both chronic inflammation diseases and viral infection.","Khanh, Vuong Cat; Fukushige, Mizuho; Chang, Yun Hsuan; Hoang, Ngo Nhat; Yamashita, Toshiharu; Obata-Yasuoka, Mana; Hamada, Hiromi; Osaka, Motoo; Hiramatsu, Yuji; Ohneda, Osamu",Stem cells dev,389,16

METHODS: We used routine care data from 36 hospitals in France and Luxembourg to assess the effectiveness of corticosteroids with at least 0.4 mg/kg/day equivalent prednisone (treatment group) versus standard of care (control group). Participants were adults aged 80 years or older with PCR-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or CT scan images typical of COVID-19 pneumonia, requiring oxygen &#8805;3 L/min, and with an inflammatory syndrome (C-reactive protein &#8805;40 mg/L). The primary outcome was overall survival at day 14. In our main analysis, characteristics of patients at baseline (i.e. time when patients met all inclusion criteria) were balanced by using propensity-score inverse probability of treatment weighting. RESULTS: Among the 267 patients included in the analysis, 98 were assigned to the treatment group. Their median age was 86 years (interquartile range 83-90 years) and 95% had a SARS-CoV-2 PCR-confirmed diagnosis. In total, 43/98 (43.9%) patients in the treatment group and 84/166 (50.6%) in the control group died before day 14 (weighted hazard ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.99). The treatment and control groups did not differ significantly for the proportion of patients discharged to home/rehabilitation at day 14 (weighted relative risk 1.12, 95% CI 0.68-1.82). Twenty-two (16.7%) patients receiving corticosteroids developed adverse events, but only 11 (6.4%) from the control group.

Objective: To describe case characteristics, including viral dynamics and transmission of infection, for individuals who have clinically recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection but continued to have positive test results following discontinuation of isolation precautions. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used data collected from June 11, 2020, to October 19, 2020, as part of the National Basketball Association (NBA) closed campus occupational health program in Orlando, Florida, which required daily RT-PCR testing and ad hoc serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. Nearly 4000 NBA players, staff, and vendors participated in the NBA's regular and postseason occupational health program in Orlando. Persistent positive cases were those who recovered from a documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, satisfied US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for discontinuation of isolation precautions, and had at least 1 postinfection positive RT-PCR test(s) result. Exposures: Person-days of participation in indoor, unmasked activities that involved direct exposure between persistent positive cases and noninfected individuals. Main Outcomes and Measures: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 following interaction with persistent positive individuals, as measured by the number of new COVID-19 cases in the Orlando campus program. Results: Among 3648 individuals who participated, 36 (1%) were persistent positive cases, most of whom were younger than 30 years (24 [67%]) and male (34 [94%]). Antibodies were detected in 33 individuals (91.7%); all remained asymptomatic following the index persistent positive RT-PCR result. Cycle threshold values for persistent positive RT-PCR test results were typically above the Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2 limit of detection. Cases were monitored for up to 100 days (mean [SD], 51 [23.9] days), during which there were at least 1480 person-days of direct exposure activities, with no transmission events or secondary infections of SARS-CoV-2 detected (0 new cases). Conclusions and Relevance: In this retrospective cohort study of the 2020 NBA closed campus occupational health program, recovered individuals who continued to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 following discontinuation of isolation were not infectious to others. These findings support time-based US Centers of Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for ending isolation.","Mack, Christina D; DiFiori, John; Tai, Caroline G; Shiue, Kristin Y; Grad, Yonatan H; Anderson, Deverick J; Ho, David D; Sims, Leroy; LeMay, Christopher; Mancell, Jimmie; Maragakis, Lisa L",JAMA Intern Med,389,26

A detailed dynamic and energetic view of the binding mechanisms underlying virus entry is not fully understood and the consensus around the molecular origins behind binding preferences of SARS-CoV-2 for binding with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) host receptor is yet to be established. In this work, we performed a comprehensive computational investigation in which sequence analysis and modeling of coevolutionary networks are combined with atomistic molecular simulations and comparative binding free energy analysis of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domains with the ACE2 host receptor. Different from other computational studies, we systematically examine the molecular and energetic determinants of the binding mechanisms between SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 proteins through the lens of coevolution, conformational dynamics, and allosteric interactions that conspire to drive binding interactions and signal transmission. Conformational dynamics analysis revealed the important differences in mobility of the binding interfaces for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are not confined to several binding hotspots, but instead are broadly distributed across many interface residues. Through coevolutionary network analysis and dynamics-based alanine scanning, we established linkages between the binding energy hotspots and potential regulators and carriers of signal communication in the virus-host receptor complexes. The results of this study detailed a binding mechanism in which the energetics of the SARS-CoV-2 association with ACE2 may be determined by cumulative changes of a number of residues distributed across the entire binding interface. The central findings of this study are consistent with structural and biochemical data and highlight drug discovery challenges of inhibiting large and adaptive protein-protein interfaces responsible for virus entry and infection transmission.","Verkhivker, Gennady",Int. j. mol. sci.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) denotes the phase between the preclinical phase and clinical overt dementia. AD mouse models that overexpress human amyloid-ß (Aß) are used to study disease pathogenesis and to conduct drug development/testing. However, there is no direct correlation between the Aß deposition, the age of onset and the severity of cognitive dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: To detect and predict MCI when Aß plaques start to appear in the hippocampus of an AD mouse. METHODS: We trained wild-type and AD mice in a Morris water maze (WM) task with different inter-trial intervals (ITI) at 3 months of age and assessed their WM performance. Additionally, we used a classification algorithm to predict the genotype (APPtg versus wild-type) of individual mice from their respective WM data. RESULTS: MCI can be empirically detected using a short-ITI protocol. We show that the ITI modulates the spatial learning of AD mice without affecting the formation of spatial memory. Finally, a simple classification algorithm such as logistic regression on WM data can give an accurate prediction of the cognitive dysfunction of a specific mouse. CONCLUSION: MCI can be detected as well predicted simultaneously with the onset of Aß deposition in the hippocampus in AD mouse model. The mild cognitive impairment prediction can be used for assessing the efficacy of a treatment.","Rai, Surya Prakash; Bascuñana, Pablo; Brackhan, Mirjam; Krohn, Markus; Möhle, Luisa; Paarmann, Kristin; Pahnke, Jens",J. alzheimers dis,389,24

In this study, we developed dual-targeting cationic microbubbles conjugated with iRGD peptides(Cyclo(Cys-Arg-Gly-Asp-Lys-Gly-Pro-Asp-Cys)) and CCR2 (chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2) antibodies (MBiRGD/CCR2) for ultrasound molecular imaging and targeted tumor gene therapy. The ultrasound molecular imaging experiments showed that there were significantly enhanced ultrasound molecular imaging signals in the tumor that received MBiRGD/CCR2, compared with those that received MBiRGD, MBCCR2, or MBcontrol. As a therapy plasmid, pGPU6/GFP/Neo-shAKT2, carrying an expression cassette for the human AKT2 RNA interference sequence, was used. Our results demonstrated that MBiRGD/CCR2 had a significantly higher gene transfection efficiency than MBiRGD, MBCCR2, or MBcontrol under ultrasound irradiation, resulting in much lower AKT2 protein expression and stronger tumor growth inhibition effects in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, our study demonstrated a novel gene delivery system via MBiRGD/CCR2 for ultrasound molecular-imaging-guided gene therapy of breast cancer.","Liu, Yingying; Zhou, Yuli; Xu, Jinfeng; Luo, Hui; Zhu, Yao; Zeng, Xinxin; Dong, Fajin; Wei, Zhanghong; Yan, Fei; Zheng, Hairong",Biomaterials science,389,1

The mRNA vaccines are not new: vaccines that are based on attenuated mRNA viruses, such as Mumps, Measles, and Rubella, immunize by delivering their mRNAs into the cells of the vaccinated individual, who produces the viral proteins that then prime the immune response. Synthetic mRNA in liposomes can be seen as a modern, more refined, and thereby a safer version of those live attenuated RNA viruses. The anti-COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (coding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein) is the third synthetic RNA therapeutic being approved. It follows the aptamer Macugen® (which neutralizes VEGF) and the siRNA Onpattro® (which destroys the transthyretin-coding mRNA). Remarkably, the 30 µg of mRNA that are contained in the first approved anti-COVID-19 vaccine are sufficient for generating high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the virus in all injected volunteers (including participants over 65 years old).

Harm reduction (HR) services, which aim to reduce the negative effects of drug use on health, are likely to be diminished in a pandemic. However, innovative HR interventions and messaging may also develop in response to such a crisis. It is vital to understand the most effective ways to deliver HR in pandemic situations so that guidance can be provided for current and future disruptions to service provision. METHODS: A rapid evidence review was conducted with the aim of exploring what HR interventions and messaging are most effective during a pandemic-type situation. Ten health databases were systematically searched using terms relevant to the research aim. A search was also made of grey literature, including a targeted search of HR messaging from key national and service provider websites. RESULTS: In the initial search, 121 pieces of evidence were identified which, after screening and de-duplication, resulted in 60 for inclusion. The included evidence consists mainly of non-peer reviewed, pre-publication or expert opinion pieces. The rapid findings suggest that HR services should be deemed essential during a pandemic, with staff supported to work safely and social distancing adaptations implemented. Services should be encouraged to operate more flexibly; for instance, in deciding the amounts of take-home supplies of injecting equipment and medications. The evidence on HR communication was very limited but key messages on infection control, uncertain drug supply and accessing services were identified. CONCLUSIONS: This rapid evidence review identifies implications for national policy makers, commissioners and HR service providers. A person-centred rather than disease-centred approach to HR delivered by collaborating partners, as well as prioritizing tailored HR messaging, is recommended. Further research evaluating the delivery of HR services and messaging, particularly focusing on health inequalities, is urgently needed.","Wilkinson, Rebecca; Hines, Lindsey; Holland, Adam; Mandal, Sema; Phipps, Emily",Harm Reduct J,389,33

We aimed to analyze which symptoms and laboratory abnormalities were associated with the presence of headache and to evaluate if patients with headache had a higher adjusted in-hospital risk of mortality. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. We included all consecutive patients admitted to the Hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 8th and April 11th, 2020. We collected demographic data, clinical variables and laboratory abnormalities. We used multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: During the study period, 576 patients were included, aged 67.2 (SD: 14.7), and 250/576 (43.3%) being female. Presence of headache was described by 137 (23.7%) patients. The all-cause in-hospital mortality rate was 127/576 (20.0%). In the multivariate analysis, patients with headache had a lower risk of mortality (OR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.17-0.88, p = 0.007). After adjusting for multiple comparisons in a multivariate analysis, variables that were independently associated with a higher odds of having headache in COVID-19 patients were anosmia, myalgia, female sex and fever; variables that were associated with a lower odds of having headache were younger age, lower score on modified Rankin scale, and, regarding laboratory variables on admission, increased C-reactive protein, abnormal platelet values, lymphopenia and increased D-dimer. CONCLUSION: Headache is a frequent symptom in COVID-19 patients and its presence is an independent predictor of lower risk of mortality in COVID-19 hospitalized patients.","Trigo, Javier; García-Azorín, David; Planchuelo-Gómez, Álvaro; Martínez-Pías, Enrique; Talavera, Blanca; Hernández-Pérez, Isabel; Valle-Peñacoba, Gonzalo; Simón-Campo, Paula; de Lera, Mercedes; Chavarría-Miranda, Alba; López-Sanz, Cristina; Gutiérrez-Sánchez, María; Martínez-Velasco, Elena; Pedraza, María; Sierra, Álvaro; Gómez-Vicente, Beatriz; Arenillas, Juan Francisco; Guerrero, Ángel L",J Headache Pain,389,20

Therefore, the enterprises are more and more difficult. Many enterprises are not strong enough to restore production, so it is necessary to find solutions to overcome this difficult period. In this research, the author used the application of modern statistical techniques, along with the Grey method, to predict enterprises’ business results in the future, combined with the model of Super-slacks-based-measure efficiency (Super-SBM) to help businesses select the right partners in a supply chain to achieve their business goals. By our proposed approach, the selected solution (AG6 combined with AG10) should be implemented in the future to upgrade efficiency to help stabilize output and raise productivity;thus, both parties are able not only to improve their product quality but also achieve business goals and sustainable development. In fact, it is necessary to further this study, in combination with these factors and other quantitative models, to give investors a more comprehensive view, helping them to make the right decisions and appropriately develop their businesses and social and economic development. © 2021 by the author.

In this study, we performed a retrospective case-control study of adipokine levels in patients with acute respiratory failure caused by either COVID-19 or other viral/bacterial source. All patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure in the University of Virginia Biorepository and Tissue Research database were included. We also selected patients with non-COVID-19 infectious respiratory failure from the same biorepository to serve as a comparison cohort. Plasma adipokine levels were measured on three occasions during the first 72 hours of hospitalization. Twelve patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure and 17 patients with other infectious respiratory failure were studied. Adiponectin levels were significantly lower in patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure, even after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, and other covariates. In conclusion, adiponectin levels appear to be reduced in COVID-19 respiratory failure.

Social distancing or isolation measures were taken to mitigate the pandemic. Furthermore, stress and low socioeconomic status in humans confer increased vulnerability to morbidity and mortality, what can be biologically observed. This condition tends to remain during the Covid-19 pandemic. Social disruption stress (SDR) raises important questions regarding the functioning of the immune system, and the release of several stress hormones. A molecular pattern, conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA), is thought to have evolved to defend against physical injury during periods of heightened risk. Chronic CTRA activation could leave an organism vulnerable to viral infections, leading to increased pro-inflammatory gene expression and a suppression of anti-viral gene expression. The activation of such transcriptional status is related to conditions of social stress through either hostile human contact, or increased predatory vulnerability due to separation from the social group and also low socioeconomic status. This review aims to point out questions for government officials, researchers and health professionals to better target their actions during a pandemic and encourage studies for a better understanding of these characteristics.","Mattos dos Santos, Rodrigo","Brain, Behav., Immun. - Health",389,20

In this article, the role and significance of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in drug development and the treatment of COVID-19 are discussed. It was found that the binding of ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2-RBD involved two core regions (31st and 353rd lysine) and 20 amino acids of the ACE2 protein. The mutation of these amino acids could lead to a great change of the binding ability of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2-RBD. This information was important for us to find more efficient ACE2 peptides to block the 2019-nCoV infection. So during this study, we summarized the role of ACE2 in the regulation of 2019-nCoV infection and stress, and hypothesized that the development and optimization of ACE2 peptide can effectively block 2019-nCoV infection and reliably treat the COVID-19.","Liu, Yang; He, Huanzhong; Huang, Huilian",J Clin Lab Anal,389,16

Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) was employed as a means of analyzing DNA polymorphisms in six common physiological races of Pgt in China and Ug99. In total, 64 pairs of primers were used for AFLP screening of race-specific molecular markers. One primer pair-namely, E7/M7 (5'-GACTGCGTACCAATTCG G-3'/5'-GATGAGTCCTGAGTAACGG-3')-yielded a unique band for the race 34MKG that was purified and cloned into the pGEM-T vector for sequencing. We then designed a new primer pairs (sequence-characterized amplified region marker) to amplify the 171-bp fragment and confirmed that the marker was highly specific for 34MKG. These results provide a new tool for monitoring different races of Pgt for improved control of wheat stem rust in China.","Chen, Si; Yang, Xue; Huang, Wen-Gong; Liu, Yan; Yu, Ying; Wu, Guang-Wen; Zhang, Shu-Quan; Li, Tian-Ya; Cao, Yuan-Yin",Mol.

RECENT FINDINGS: There has been a transient counterbalancing, in which the response to Covid-19 has briefly mitigated pollution and greenhouse gasses. This divergence belies multiple commonalities of cause and effect. SUMMARY: The convergence of these two pandemics is unprecedented. Although at first glance, they appear to be completely unrelated, they share striking commonalities. Both are caused by human behaviors, and some of those behaviors contribute to both pandemics at the same time. Both illustrate the fact that isolation is not an option; these are global issues that inescapably affect all persons and all nations. Both incur prodigious current and anticipated costs. Both have similar societal impacts, and disproportionately harm those with lesser resources, widening the gap between the 'haves and the have-nots.' One can only hope that the devastation caused by these unprecedented pandemics will lead to increased awareness of how human beings have helped to create them and how our responses can and will shape our future.","Joshi, Manish; Caceres, Jose; Ko, Steven; Epps, Sarenthia M; Bartter, Thaddeus",Curr Opin Pulm Med,389,14

Herein, we developed EGYVIR as a potent immunomodulatory herbal extract with promising antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. It constitutes of a combination of black pepper extract with curcumin extract. The antiviral effect of EGYVIR extract is attributed to the two key phases of the disease in severe cases. First, the inhibition of the nuclear translocation of NF-kß p50, attenuating the SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated cytokine storm. Additionally, the EGYVIR extract has an in vitro virucidal effect for SARS-CoV-2. The in vitro study of EGYVIR extract against SARS-CoV-2 on Huh-7 cell lines, revealed the potential role of NF-kß/TNF&#945;/IL-6 during the infection process. EGYVIR antagonizes the NF-kß pathway in-silico and in-vitro studies. Consequently, it has the potential to hinder the release of IL-6 and TNF&#945;, decreasing the production of essential cytokines storm elements.","Roshdy, Wael H; Rashed, Helmy A; Kandeil, Ahmed; Mostafa, Ahmed; Moatasim, Yassmin; Kutkat, Omnia; Abo Shama, Noura M; Gomaa, Mokhtar R; El-Sayed, Ibrahim H; El Guindy, Nancy M; Naguib, Amal; Kayali, Ghazi; Ali, Mohamed A",PLoS One,389,3

An increasing use of technology, both in care and dementia clinical trials, depends upon caregivers' abilities as a user. Accordingly, the aim of our study was to verify the current technology (smartphone and computer) use and acceptance in care, regarding socio-demographic variables; (2) Methods: Questionnaires were distributed to 102 dementia caregivers, mostly of patients with moderate dementia; (3) Results: The majority of participants were women (63%), and large number of them used technological devices such as a smartphone (91%) or computer (81%). Results revealed differences between age, gender, and education level on technology acceptance. Interestingly, smartphone use and acceptance seemed to be feasible, regardless of age, whereas computer use was negatively correlated with age. Technology was perceived by respondents as most useful for patients' activities including locomotion, toileting, and meals; (4) Conclusions: The future of technology use in dementia care should indicate solutions tailored to individual characteristics such as new technology solutions (GPS trackers, smartphone apps, dietary intervention, and meal planning apps).","Wójcik, Daniel; Szczechowiak, Katarzyna; Konopka, Patrycja; Owczarek, Mateusz; Kuzia, Agata; Rydlewska-Liszkowska, Izabela; Pikala, Malgorzata",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),389,15

Patients and Methods: We enrolled all consecutive patients admitted to Internal Medicine wards of Padova University Hospital between 7 March and 30 April 2020 for COVID-19-related pneumonia (cases) vs. non-COVID-19 pneumonia (controls). A group of healthy subjects acted as baseline for thromboelastometry parameters. Results: Fifty-six cases (mean age 64±15 yrs, M/F 37/19) and 56 controls (mean age 76±11 yrs, M/F 35/21) were enrolled. Cases and controls showed markedly hypercoagulable thromboelastometry profiles vs. healthy subjects, mainly characterized by a significantly shorter propagation phase of coagulation (Clot Formation Time, CFT) and significantly increased maximum clot firmness (MCF) (p <0.001 in all comparisons). COVID-19 patients with pneumonia had significantly shorter CFT and higher MCF (p <0.01 and <0.05, respectively in all comparisons) vs. controls. Conclusion: Patients admitted to internal medicine wards for COVID-19 pneumonia presented a markedly prothrombotic state, which seems peculiar to COVID-19 rather than pneumonia itself.","Spiezia, Luca; Campello, Elena; Cola, Marco; Poletto, Francesco; Cerruti, Lorenzo; Poretto, Anna; Simion, Chiara; Cattelan, Annamaria; Vettor, Roberto; Simioni, Paolo",,389,33

We show that purely mathematical procedures for site selection should be supervised by known phylogeny (i) to ensure that solid tree branches are represented instead of mutational hotspots with poor phylogeographic proprieties, and (ii) to avoid phylogenetic redundancy. We propose a procedure that prevents information redundancy in site selection by considering the cumulative informativeness of previously selected sites (as a proxy for phylogenetic-based criteria). This procedure demonstrates that, for short barcodes (e.g., 11 sites), there are thousands of informative site combinations that improve previous proposals. We also show that barcodes based on worldwide databases inevitably prioritize variants located at the basal nodes of the phylogeny, such that most representative genomes in these ancestral nodes are no longer in circulation. Consequently, coronavirus phylodynamics cannot be properly captured by universal genomic barcodes because most SARS-CoV-2 variation is generated in geographically restricted areas by the continuous introduction of domestic variants.","Pardo-Seco, Jacobo; Gómez-Carballa, Alberto; Bello, Xabier; Martinón-Torres, Federico; Salas, Antonio",Zool Res,389,16

There was also a cluster of three central venous catheter (CVC) infections along with increases in the number of patients from whom enteric Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) were isolated from sterile sites. Environmental sampling of near-patient surfaces and frequently touched sites demonstrated that 11.5% of areas were contaminated with enteric GNB in the COVID-19 CC area, compared with 2.6% and 2.7% in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 general wards, respectively. Following a risk assessment, hospital policy was changed to replace long-sleeved gowns with short-sleeved gowns. The CC unit underwent enhanced cleaning with hypochlorite-based disinfectant and was resampled 8 days later. On resampling, no GNB were isolated from the CC unit. Following this change in PPE, hand hygiene compliance returned to baseline standards and no further CVC infections were identified. Staff reported a preference for short-sleeved gowns. No evidence currently exists that PPE beyond that recommended for pandemic influenza (respiratory protection plus standard PPE) adds to the protection of healthcare workers (HCWs) from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. Long-sleeved gowns prevent HCWs performing hand hygiene effectively. While it is imperative that HCWs are adequately protected, protection of patients from infection hazards is equally important. Further studies are necessary to establish risks from PPE to inform a review of current guidance.","Meda, M; Gentry, V; Reidy, P; Garner, D",J Hosp Infect,389,10

Three of them died from the infection. This study monitors the antibodies formation in group of seniors who have overcome the infection. Between April and November (1-8 months after the infection), the antibodies were measured repeatedly within the period of several weeks. The virus neutralizing tests was used as well as the ECLIA assay by Roche (total immunoglobulins), CMIA assay by Abbott (IgG) and ELISA assay by Euroimmun (IgG and IgA). Six months from the infection, neutralizing antibodies were detected in 18 out of 20 seniors. High levels of neutralizing antibodies correlated with higher levels of immunoglobulins and were a good predictor of an increase of IgG in the autumn during the second wave of the epidemic in the Czech Republic. During the autumn wave, neither any of the clients, nor any staff contracted the virus, although the prevalence of PCR positivity in the Vyso&#269;ina region reached around 5 %. The antigen tests also came out all negative. This study shows that in the senior population, the production of protective antibodies follows a normal pattern, and the seniors are probably immune to a repeated infection for at least 8 months from the first infection. Based on these results, we would like to open the discussion on the testing for seroprevalence in nursing homes, possible changes to the epidemiologic regime in relation to the risk of infection, and about vaccination schemes in these centers.","Fejt, Václav; Krátká, Zuzana; Zelená, Hana; Fürst, Tomás",Cas Lek Cesk,389,1

This is an infectious and even life-threatening disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has rapidly spread to other countries from its originating place infecting millions of people globally. To understand future phenomena, strong mathematical models are required with the least prediction errors. In the present study, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) models are applied to the data consisting of daily confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in the most affected five countries of the world for modeling and predicting one-month confirmed cases of this disease. To validate these models, the prediction results were tested by comparing it with testing data. The results revealed better accuracy of the LS-SVM model over the ARIMA model and also suggested a rapid rise of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases in all the countries under study. This analysis would help governments to take necessary actions in advance associated with the preparation of isolation wards, availability of medicines and medical staff, a decision on lockdown, training of volunteers, and economic plans.","Singh, Sarbjit; Parmar, Kulwinder Singh; Makkhan, Sidhu Jitendra Singh; Kaur, Jatinder; Peshoria, Shruti; Kumar, Jatinder",Chaos Solitons Fractals,389,1

Remote learning may impact health behaviors and coping strategies among adolescents, including reduced physical activity and increased screen time. Social media and peers provide information about the pandemic to adolescents and may influence prevention behaviors. This study aims to assess adolescent knowledge and information about COVID-19, determine students' behavior change, and identify sources students turn to for information on the pandemic. METHODS: Students from 2 high schools in semi-rural Georgia participated in a cross-sectional online survey in March 2020 (N = 761). RESULTS: Common sources for COVID-19 news were peers (80%) and social media (58%). Few adolescents (3%) indicated that teenagers were at higher risk of severe illness due to COVID-19. Responses reveal adolescents understand social distancing and many are participating in prevention behaviors, including handwashing (87%) and staying at home as much as possible (87%). Most respondents reported increases in screen time outside of class (82%). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest adolescents are obtaining COVID-19 knowledge from various sources, including social media, with varying degrees of implementation of prevention practices. Increases in screen time and reduced physical activity may impact long-term health among adolescents.","Campbell, Katherine; Weingart, Rachel; Ashta, Jasleen; Cronin, Thomas; Gazmararian, Julie",J. sch. health,389,17

The virus concentration in faeces and its temporal variations are essential information for WBE. While some clinical studies have reported SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in faeces, the value varies amongst patients and changes over time. The present study aimed to examine how the temporal variations in the concentration of virus in faeces affect the monitoring of disease incidence. We reanalysed the experimental findings of clinical studies to estimate the duration of virus shedding and the faecal virus concentration. Available experimental data as of 23 October 2020 were collected. The viral shedding kinetics was modelled, and the dynamic model was fitted to the collected data by a Bayesian framework. Using posterior distributions, the duration of viral shedding and the concentration of virus copies in faeces over time were computed. We estimated the median concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in faeces as 2.6 (95% CrI: 0.22-4.8) log copies per gram-faeces over the shedding period, and our model implied that the duration of viral shedding was 23.2 days (95% CrI: 19.5-31.5), given the current standard quantification limit (Ct = 40). With simulated incidences, our results also indicated that a one-week delay between symptom onset and wastewater sampling increased the estimation of incidence by a factor of 7.4 (i.e., 100.87 times higher). Our results demonstrated that the temporal variation in virus concentration in faeces affects microbial monitoring systems such as WBE. The present study also implied the need for adjusting the estimates of virus concentration in faeces by incorporating the kinetics of unobserved concentrations. The method used in this study is easily implemented in further simulations; therefore, the results of this study might contribute to enhancing disease surveillance and risk assessments that require quantities of virus to be excreted into the environment.","Miura, Fuminari; Kitajima, Masaaki; Omori, Ryosuke",Sci Total Environ,389,16

It has not only associated with physiological disorder but also with psychological distress and symptoms of mental illness. Whether the vaccines and antivirals can provide protects remains unknown. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is recommended as an alternative and significant way of preventing and treating COVID-19 in China. However, few studies have assessed the benefits of this treatment and mental health after they recover. Our study is designed to investigate effects and safety when using TCM on the course of this disease and the impact of COVID-19 on pandemic-related anxiety. METHOD: For this prospective cohort study, we will enroll 300 COVID-19 patients aged 18 to 80 years at 4 centers. We divide them into 2 groups, according to whether they use Baidu Jieduan Granule at a ratio of 1:1. We will compare treatments combined Baidu Jieduan Granule with conventional Western medicine (experimental group) vs treatment of conventional Western medicine only (control group). The basic information of patients including demographic, general condition, primary diseases, and complications will be assessed. Related examines will be conducted at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days. The primary outcomes are clinical outcome. A follow-up time of 1 year (to June 30, 2021) allow us to evaluate the psychiatric disorder after recovery. We will monitor adverse events throughout the trial. DISCUSSION: It will be the first prospective cohort study which uses Baidu Jieduan Granule, based on the innovation traditional Chinese medicine strategy of "" Internal and External Relieving -Truncated Torsion "" to treat the common type of COVID-19. The result of this study may provide evidence-based recommendations of TCM for treatment and psychological distress or symptoms of mental illness of the common type of COVID-19.","Wu, Xinxin; Lu, Wei; Guo, Quan; Cao, Min; Zhang, Wen; Liu, Changya; Qu, Yao; Peng, Wei; Che, Jinhua; Fang, Bangjiang; Zhou, Shuang",Medicine (Baltimore),389,16

The scientific community has mounted a strong response by accelerating research and innovation, and has quickly set the foundation for understanding the molecular determinants of the disease for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. The replication of the viral genome within the infected cells is a key stage of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. It is a complex process involving the action of several viral and host proteins in order to perform RNA polymerization, proofreading and final capping. This review provides an update of the structural and functional data on the key actors of the replicatory machinery of SARS-CoV-2, to fill the gaps in the currently available structural data, which is mainly obtained through homology modeling. Moreover, learning from similar viruses, we collect data from the literature to reconstruct the pattern of interactions among the protein actors of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase machinery. Here, an important role is played by co-factors such as Nsp8 and Nsp10, not only as allosteric activators but also as molecular connectors that hold the entire machinery together to enhance the efficiency of RNA replication.","Romano, Maria; Ruggiero, Alessia; Squeglia, Flavia; Maga, Giovanni; Berisio, Rita",,389,16

METHOD: Five cities (i.e., Shanghai, Suzhou, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hangzhou) with the largest number of H7N9 cases in mainland China from 2013 to 2017 were selected in this study. Data on laboratory-confirmed H7N9 human cases in those five cities were obtained from the Chinese National Influenza Centre. The detailed information of LPMs closure (i.e., area and duration) was obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture. We used a generalized linear model with a Poisson link to estimate the effect of LPMs closure, reported as relative risk reduction (RRR). We used classification and regression trees (CARTs) model to select and quantify the dominant factor of H7N9 infection. RESULTS: All five cities implemented the LPMs closure, and the risk of H7N9 infection decreased significantly after LPMs closure with RRR ranging from 0.80 to 0.93. Respectively, a long-term LPMs closure for 10-13 weeks elicited a sustained and highly significant risk reduction of H7N9 infection (RRR = 0.98). Short-time LPMs closure with 2 weeks in every epidemic did not reduce the risk of H7N9 infection (p > 0.05). Partially closed LPMs in some suburbs contributed only 35% for reduction rate (RRR = 0.35). Shenzhen implemented partial closure for first 3 epidemics (p > 0.05) and all closure in the latest 2 epidemic waves (RRR = 0.64). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that LPMs all closure in whole city can be a highly effective measure comparing with partial closure (i.e. only urban closure, suburb and rural remain open). Extend the duration of closure and consider permanently closing the LPMs will help improve the control effect. The effect of LPMs closure seems greater than that of meteorology on H7N9 transmission.","Chen, Ying; Cheng, Jian; Xu, Zhiwei; Hu, Wenbiao; Lu, Jiahai",BMC Infect Dis,389,6

Rapid serological tests (RSTs) could be an invaluable tool for HCWs to control COVID-19 transmission. This study assesses the benefits of RSTs for HCWs in Marseille, France. Study design: Mixed-methods exploratory analysis. Methods: A mixed-methods approach was used, combining quantitative and qualitative data, to prospectively analyse acceptability of RSTs, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and prevention behaviours in 106 HCWs from 18 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and health or social institutions in Marseille from June 1 to July 31, 2020. For the qualitative dimension, semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 21 HCWs from 7 of 18 NGOs and institutions. Results: Most of the 106 HCWs in the quantitative study reported better prevention measures at work than in their homes. Despite this, the majority reported that they felt unsafe at work in terms of COVID-19 infection risk. SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence among the study population was 6.1%. Only four HCWs refused to have an RST.The 21 qualitative interviews highlighted that HCWs were not afraid of RSTs or of any possible stigma associated with a positive serological status, although they were sometimes suspicious about RST validity. Downplaying their risk of infection was a coping strategy to keep both a sense of control and remain motivated at work. Conclusions: RSTs should be adopted as an additional tool in the strategy to protect both HCWs and healthcare service users. Additional follow-up of these observational findings is needed, especially with the increasing prevalence of vaccination in HCWs.","Mosnier, Emilie; Nevissas, Olivia; Loubière, Sandrine; Mosnier, Marine; Bosetti, Thomas; Bottero, Julie; Roux, Perrine; Monfardini, Elisabetta; Tinland, Aurélie",Public Health Pract (Oxf),389,21

In most of these patients, uncontrolled local and systemic hyperinflammation induces severe and often lethal outcomes. The aging process is characterized by the gradual development of a chronic subclinical systemic inflammation (inflamm-aging) and by acquired immune system impairment (immune senescence). Here, we advance the hypothesis that four well-recognized features of aging contribute to the disproportionate SARS-CoV-2 mortality suffered by elderly men: i. the presence of subclinical systemic inflammation without overt disease, ii. a blunted acquired immune system and type I interferon response due to the chronic inflammation; iii. the downregulation of ACE2 (i.e. the SARS-CoV-2 receptor); and iv. accelerated biological aging. The high mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection suggests that clarification of the mechanisms of inflamm-aging and immune senescence can help combat not only age-related disorders but also SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Bonafè, Massimiliano; Prattichizzo, Francesco; Giuliani, Angelica; Storci, Gianluca; Sabbatinelli, Jacopo; Olivieri, Fabiola",Cytokine Growth Factor Rev,389,25

Therefore, the identification of lipids and metabolic pathways that are suitable targets for antiviral development is crucial. Using a library of compounds targeting host lipid metabolic factors and testing them for their ability to block pseudorabies virus (PRV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection, we found that U18666A, a specific inhibitor of Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), is highly potent in suppressing the entry of diverse viruses including pseudotyped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). NPC1 deficiency markedly attenuates viral growth by decreasing cholesterol abundance in the plasma membrane, thereby inhibiting the dynamics of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), which are indispensable for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Significantly, exogenous cholesterol can complement the dynamics of CCPs, leading to efficient viral entry and infectivity. Administration of U18666A improves the survival and pathology of PRV- and influenza A virus-infected mice. Thus, our studies demonstrate a unique mechanism by which NPC1 inhibition achieves broad antiviral activity, indicating a potential new therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2, as well as other emerging viruses.","Li, Guoli; Su, Bingqian; Fu, Pengfei; Bai, Yilin; Ding, Guangxu; Li, Dahua; Wang, Jiang; Yang, Guoyu; Chu, Beibei","Sci.

Previous research reported the tolerance of crops to acid soil stress. However, the molecular response of woody plant to acid conditions remains largely unclear. Rhododendron L. is a widely distributed woody plant genus and prefers to grow in acidic soils. Herein, weighted gene coexpression network analysis was performed on R. protistum var. giganteum seedlings subjected to five pH treatments (3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.0, 7.0), and their ecophysiological characteristics were determined for the identification of their molecular responses to acidic environments. Through pairwise comparison, 855 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with photosynthesis, cell wall, and phenylpropanoid metabolism were identified. Most of the DEGs related to photosynthesis and cell wall were up-regulated after pH 4.5 treatment. Results implied that the species improves its photosynthetic abilities and changes its cell wall characteristics to adapt to acidic conditions. Weighted gene co-expression network analyses showed that most of the hub genes were annotated to the biosynthetic pathways of ribosomal proteins and photosynthesis. Expression pattern analysis showed that genes encoding subunit ribosomal proteins decreased at pH 7.0 treatment, suggesting that pH 7.0 treatment led to cell injury in the seedlings. The species regulates protein synthesis in response to high pH stress (pH 7.0). The present study revealed the molecular response mechanism of woody plant R. protistum var. giganteum to acid environments.

Now, it has spread to over 200 countries. COVID 19-associated respiratory syndrome is causing a lot of mortality and morbidity. There are reports suggesting that the complications and ARDS associated with COVID 19 is an immune response reaction. The cytokine storm associated with severe cases of COVID 19 acts as a cause of death in many sick patients. It has been shown that COVID 19 is associated with a peculiar immune profile: Decrease in CD3, CD4, CD8, natural killer cell and B-cells; Rise in interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha; Decrease in IL-10; Decrease in interferon-gamma. Low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) immunosuppressive features resulting from M2 macrophage phenotype activation, increase in IL-10, transforming growth factor beta, a decrease in IL-6, TNF alpha and an increase in CD3, CD4, and CD8 T cell counts may negate the harmful effects of cytokine release syndrome.

In radiology, social determinants of health lead to disparate use of imaging services through multiple intersecting contributors, on both the provider and patient side, affecting diagnosis and treatment. Disparities on the provider side include ordering of initial or follow-up imaging studies and providing standard-of-care interventional procedures, while patient factors include differences in awareness of screening exams and confidence in the healthcare system. Disparate utilization of mammography and lung cancer screening lead to delayed diagnosis, while differential provision of minimally invasive interventional procedures contributes to differential outcomes related to treatment.

We assessed the independent effects of diabetes status, by type, on in-hospital death in England in patients with COVID-19 during the period from March 1 to May 11, 2020. METHODS: We did a whole-population study assessing risks of in-hospital death with COVID-19 between March 1 and May 11, 2020. We included all individuals registered with a general practice in England who were alive on Feb 16, 2020. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the effect of diabetes status, by type, on in-hospital death with COVID-19, adjusting for demographic factors and cardiovascular comorbidities. Because of the absence of data on total numbers of people infected with COVID-19 during the observation period, we calculated mortality rates for the population as a whole, rather than the population who were infected. FINDINGS: Of the 61â414â470 individuals who were alive and registered with a general practice on Feb 16, 2020, 263â830 (0·4%) had a recorded diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, 2â864â670 (4·7%) had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, 41â750 (0·1%) had other types of diabetes, and 58â244â220 (94·8%) had no diabetes. 23â698 in-hospital COVID-19-related deaths occurred during the study period. A third occurred in people with diabetes: 7434 (31·4%) in people with type 2 diabetes, 364 (1·5%) in those with type 1 diabetes, and 69 (0·3%) in people with other types of diabetes. Unadjusted mortality rates per 100â000 people over the 72-day period were 27 (95% CI 27-28) for those without diabetes, 138 (124-153) for those with type 1 diabetes, and 260 (254-265) for those with type 2 diabetes. Adjusted for age, sex, deprivation, ethnicity, and geographical region, compared with people without diabetes, the odds ratios (ORs) for in-hospital COVID-19-related death were 3·51 (95% CI 3·16-3·90) in people with type 1 diabetes and 2·03 (1·97-2·09) in people with type 2 diabetes. These effects were attenuated to ORs of 2·86 (2·58-3·18) for type 1 diabetes and 1·80 (1·75-1·86) for type 2 diabetes when also adjusted for previous hospital admissions with coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, or heart failure. INTERPRETATION: The results of this nationwide analysis in England show that type 1 and type 2 diabetes were both independently associated with a significant increased odds of in-hospital death with COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: PAOS is a neurodegenerative syndrome in which patients present with apraxia of speech, a motor speech disorder affecting programming and planning of speech. Patients with PAOS predictably develop Parkinsonism. DAT scan is a neuroimaging tool that assesses the integrity of presynaptic dopamine transporters in striatum and is usually abnormal in PSP and CBS. METHODS: As part of an NIH-funded grant, we performed a DAT scan on 17 PAOS patients early in the disease course. DaTQUANT software was used to quantify uptake in the left and right caudate and anterior/posterior putamen, with striatum to background ratios (SBRs). The PAOS cohort was compared to 15 PSP and 8 CBS patients. RESULTS: Five PAOS patients (29%) showed abnormalities in at least one striatal region on DAT scan. When the five PAOS patients with abnormal DAT were compared to the PSP and CBS patients, the only difference observed was lower uptake in the posterior putamen in PSP (p = 0.03). There were no differences is putamen/caudate ratio or in symmetry of uptake, across all groups. There was also no difference in MDS-UPDRS-III scores between PAOS patients with and without abnormal DAT scans (p = 0.56). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal DAT scan is observed early in the disease course in approximately 30% of PAOS patients, with striatal abnormalities similar to those in PSP and CBS.","Seckin, Zeynep Idil; Whitwell, Jennifer L; Utianski, Rene L; Botha, Hugo; Ali, Farwa; Duffy, Joseph R; Clark, Heather M; Machulda, Mary M; Jordan, Lennon G; Min, Hoon-Ki; Lowe, Val J; Josephs, Keith A",J. neurol,389,24

However, the beneficial effects of this community-based intervention have not been proven or quantified for the COVID-19 pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: This is a regional population-level observational study. METHODS: Using publicly available data, we examined the effect of timing of mandated social distancing on the rate of COVID-19 cases in 119 geographic regions, derived from 41 states within the United States and 78 other countries. The highest number of new COVID-19 cases per day recorded within a geographic unit was the primary outcome. The total number of COVID-19 cases in regions where case numbers had reached the tail end of the outbreak was an exploratory outcome. RESULTS: We found that the highest number of new COVID-19 cases per day per million persons was significantly associated with the total number of COVID-19 cases per million persons on the day before mandated social distancing (ß = 0.66, P < 0.0001). These findings suggest that if mandated social distancing is not initiated until the number of existing COVID-19 cases has doubled, the eventual peak would result in 58% more COVID-19 cases per day. Subgroup analysis on those regions where the highest number of new COVID-19 cases per day has peaked showed increase in ß values to 0.85 (P < 0.0001). The total number of cases during the outbreak in a region was strongly predicted by the total number of COVID-19 cases on the day before mandated social distancing (ß = 0.97, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Initiating mandated social distancing when the numbers of COVID-19 cases are low within a region significantly reduces the number of new daily COVID-19 cases and perhaps also reduces the total number of cases in the region.","Qureshi, A I; Suri, M F K; Chu, H; Suri, H K; Suri, A K",Public health,389,24

The limited published experience of this practice suggests that it enables the delivery of needle-free symptom relief, with the potential to train family carers to administer anticipatory medications without reliance on trained health professionals. AIMS: To identify orodispersible and potential transmucosal alternatives that may be used in adults in the event of a patient having no oral or intravenous route and no access to subcutaneous injections. METHODS: The author panel identified medications through review of multiple drug formularies, review of the published evidence and their experience. Where possible, licensed alternatives were identified and any 'off label' or unlicensed medications clearly highlighted. RESULTS: A list of 27 medications is provided, which could be used either via the orodispersible or transmucosal alternative route for healthcare professionals delivering end of life care to consider when the licensed alternative routes are unavailable. All users of this guide are encouraged to use their professional judgement whenever selecting a medication for a patient, recognising that this review is neither a guideline nor a systematic review, and taking account of licensing considerations, adverse effects, potential unpredictability of time to effect and contraindications. CONCLUSION: Should it be necessary to use these orodispersible or transmucosal alternatives then any experience gained should be reported in the literature. Combined with further research, this experience offers the possibility of reducing injection frequency and inherent delays in medication administration, particularly in the community setting during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sutherland, Anna Elizabeth; Presland, Melinda; Harrop, Emily; Carey, Matthew; Miller, Mary; Wong, Ian Chi Kei Ck",BMJ support. palliat. care (Online),389,30

As a phenotype of atherosclerosis, carotid plaque and its influence factors are rarely discussed among dialysis patients. The study aimed to investigate the prognosis-predictive significance of carotid plaques in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), and explore risks factors for carotid plaque-presence. METHODS: It was an observational, prospective study. Patients that had undergone stable peritoneal dialysis for at least 3 months were recruited and divided into two subgroups: group with carotid plaques and group without carotid plaques. Cox regression model was used to identify independent predictors of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Pathogenic factors correlated to the plaque-occurrence were explored by logistic regression and verified by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: A total of 233 PD patients were recruited. The cohort was followed for up to 86 months. The carotid plaque-presence turned out to be an independent risk factor both of cardiovascular events (HR:2.659; 95%CI: 1.231-5.741; p=0.013) and cardiovascular mortality (HR:3.716; 95%CI: 1.168-11.823; p=0.026). The apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 (ApoB/ApoA1) ratio was significantly associated with the presence of carotid plaques. ROC analysis indicated that the AUC of the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio was higher than that of the traditional lipid metabolism index for detecting plaque-presence. CONCLUSIONS: Carotid plaque-presence can predict cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality in PD patients. The ApoB/ApoA1 ratio is significantly correlated to the carotid plaques and the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio had a greater sensitivity than traditional lipid indices for predicting plaque presence.","Chen, Yun; Shang, Da; Shao, Jie; Dai, Shuqi; Ge, Xiaolin; Hao, Chuanming; Zhu, Tongying",Nephrology (Carlton),389,26

A total of 185 WWTPs inflow samples were collected over the period consisting of both the first wave (mid-March to June) and the second wave (July to November). Concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (N1 and N2 assays) were quantified in these wastewaters as well as those of Human adenoviruses (HAdV) and JC polyomavirus (JCPyV), as indicators of human faecal contamination. SARS-CoV-2 N gene daily loads strongly correlated with the number of cases diagnosed one week after sampling i.e. wastewater levels were a good predictor of cases to be diagnosed in the immediate future. The conditions present at small WWTPs relative to larger WWTPs influence the ability to follow the pandemic. Small WWTPs (<24,000 inhabitants) had lower median loads of SARS-CoV-2 despite similar incidence of infection within the municipalities served by the different WWTP (but not lower loads of HAdV and JCPyV).

We evaluated the degree of correlation between neutralizing antibodies (NtAb) binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and SARS-CoV-2-S-IgG levels measured by four commercial immunoassays in sera drawn from hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Ninety sera from 51 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were tested by a pseudotyped virus neutralization assay, the LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA, the MAGLUMI 2019-nCoV IgG, and the COVID-19 ELISA IgG assays. Overall, the results obtained with the COVID-19 ELISA IgG test showed the highest agreement with the NtAb assay (&#954;, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63-1). The most sensitive tests were the pseudotyped virus NtAb assay and the COVID-19 ELISA IgG assay (92.2% for both). Overall, the degree correlation between antibody titers resulting in 50% virus neutralization (NtAb50) in the pseudotyped virus assay and SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels was strong for the Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (rho = 0.73) and moderate for the remaining assays (rho = 0.48 to 0.59). The kinetic profile of serum NtAb50 titers could not be reliably predicted by any of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassays. The suitability of SARS-CoV-2-S-IgG commercial immunoassays for inferring neutralizing activity of sera from hospitalized COVID-19 patients varies widely across tests and is influenced by the time of sera collection after the onset of symptoms.","Valdivia, Arantxa; Torres, Ignacio; Latorre, Víctor; Francés-Gómez, Clara; Albert, Eliseo; Gozalbo-Rovira, Roberto; Alcaraz, María Jesús; Buesa, Javier; Rodríguez-Díaz, Jesús; Geller, Ron; Navarro, David",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,389,25

METHODS: Seven focus groups with 28 undergraduate physical therapist students were conducted following the transitioning to full eLearning as a result of strict physical distancing measures. Focus group questions explored the students' experiences of the transition from face-to-face to full eLearning approach and the students' recommendations for improving future eLearning experiences. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: The 3 themes identified were: (1) students presenting heightened negative feelings such as anxiety, stress, and reduced motivation to study; (2) students continuing to value the face-to-face learning, as it provided social support and facilitated feedback from peers and tutors; (3) student recommendations for eLearning included having online lectures and supplementary videos but face-to-face practical classes and developing healthy learning habits such as scheduled times for studying, exercise, and other activities that regulate stress. CONCLUSIONS: The transition to a full eLearning approach in an undergraduate physical therapist education program during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that students had heightened negative emotions due to the pandemic. Students valued face-to-face practical classes to learn and receive social support from peers and tutors. Student recommendations to future eLearning suggested changes to curriculum development geared toward a greater blended approach to learning. Blended learning may include using online lectures instead of face-to-face lectures and online resources to supplement student learning of practical skills. IMPACT: As higher education moves toward a more blended approach, lessons learned from this study can help educators design future physical therapist education programs. The findings can also assist programs in delivering a full eLearning approach as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.","Ng, Leo; Seow, Kuang Cheng; MacDonald, Laetitia; Correia, Christina; Reubenson, Alan; Gardner, Peter; Spence, Angela L; Bunzli, Samantha; De Oliveira, Beatriz Ito Ramos",Phys. ther,389,29

This pandemic devastated the world by killing more than a million people, as of October 2020. It is imperative to understand the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV2 so that novel and interdisciplinary prevention, diagnostic, and therapeutic techniques could be developed. In this work, we model and analyze the transmission of SARS-CoV2 through the human respiratory tract from a molecular communication perspective. We consider that virus diffusion occurs in the mucus layer so that the shape of the tract does not have a significant effect on the transmission. Hence, this model reduces the inherent complexity of the human respiratory system. We further provide the impulse response of SARS-CoV2-ACE2 receptor binding event to determine the proportion of the virus population reaching different regions of the respiratory tract. Our findings confirm the results in the experimental literature on higher mucus flow rate causing virus migration to the lower respiratory tract. These results are especially important to understand the effect of SARS-CoV2 on the different human populations at different ages who have different mucus flow rates and ACE2 receptor concentrations in the different regions of the respiratory tract.","Koca, Caglar; Civas, Meltem; Sahin, Selin M.; Ergonul, Onder; Akan, Ozgur B.",,389,3

Exposure to epidemics and confinement have been consistently associated with psychological consequences, but changes on lifestyle behaviours remain under-researched. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey was conducted among the general population living in Spain during the COVID-19 home-isolation. In addition to demographic and clinical data, participants self-reported changes in seven lifestyle domains. The Short Multidimensional Inventory Lifestyle Evaluation was developed specifically to evaluate changes during the confinement (SMILE-C). RESULTS: A total of 1254 individuals completed the survey over the first week of data collection. The internal consistency of the SMILE-C to assess lifestyles during confinement was shown (Cronbach's Alpha=0.747). Most participants reported substantial changes on outdoor time (93.6%) and physical activity (70.2%). Moreover, about one third of subjects reported significant changes on stress management, social support, and restorative sleep. Several demographic and clinical factors were associated to lifestyle scores. In the multivariate model, those independently associated with a healthier lifestyle included substantial changes on stress management (p<0.001), social support (p=0.001) and outdoor time (p<0.001), amongst others. In contrast, being an essential worker (p=0.001), worse self-rated health (p<0.001), a positive screening for depression/anxiety (p<0.001), and substantial changes on diet/nutrition (p<0.001) and sleep (p<0.001) were all associated with poorer lifestyles. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, sizable proportions of participants reported meaningful changes in lifestyle behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. Moreover, the SMILE-C was sensitive to detect these changes and presented good initial psychometric properties. Further follow-up studies should collect relevant data to promote healthy lifestyles in pandemic times.","Balanzá-Martínez, Vicent; Kapczinski, Flavio; de Azevedo Cardoso, Taiane; Atienza-Carbonell, Beatriz; Rosa, Adriane R; Mota, Jurema C; De Boni, Raquel B","Rev. psiquiatr. salud ment.

This study was planned to find out the number of obstetrical emergency admissions and their outcomes in the form of procedures done, maternal mortality and intrauterine dead fetus in our rural tertiary care center during Covid-19 pandemic and compare it before Covid-19 pandemic in India. Material and methods: This study was a retrospective observational study conducted over a period of 1 year (6 month during Covid-19 pandemic in India from April 2020 to September 2020 and 6 months before Covid 19 pandemic). All the patients who were admitted in the Covid-19 labour room as well as in the non Covid-19 labour room of our institute were included in the study. Ethical clearance for the study was taken from ethical committee of institute before study. Data was collected from hospital record and patients case sheets. Comparison of data before and during Covid-19 pandemic was done by using chi square test and p values analysed. Results: During the total study period of 12 months including 6 months during Covid-19 pandemic and 6 months before pandemic the total number of admissions in obstetrical emergency ward were 7630 out of which 5806 admissions (76.1%) were before Covid-19 pandemic and 1824 admissions were (23.9%) during Covid-19 pandemic and it showed significant reduction (p value &lt;0.001) in emergency obstetrical admissions during pandemic. Out of total admissions, the number of cesareans were more during Covid-19 pandemic as compared to before it. Thus it showed significant increase in (p value &lt; 0.001) number of caesarean deliveries during Covid-19 pandemic at our institute. Maternal mortalities were 0.89% (52 in 5754 admissions) of obstetrical emergency admissions before Covid-19 pandemic whereas it was significantly increased during Covid-19 pandemic to 2.63%. Total number of Intrauterine death and still births were 180 in 2652 vaginal deliveries (6.7%) before Covid-19 pandemic which was also increased significantly to 108 in 842 vaginal deliveries (12.8%) during 6 month of study period during Covid-19 pandemic. Conclusions: In this study we observed significant reduction in number of admissions in obstetrical emergency ward whereas significant increase in maternal mortality and intrauterine dead fetus and stillborn babies during Covid-19 pandemic. We should educate the women that delay in seeking health care can have more dangerous complications than Covid-19 infection if they will follow the Covid-19 prevention protocols.

Herein, we report an in silico docking study of more than 860 COVID19-related compounds from the PubChem database. Molecular dynamic simulations were carried out to validate the conformation stability of compound-ligand complexes with best docking scores. The MM-PBSA approach was employed to calculate binding free energies. The comparison with ca. 50 previously reported potential SARS-CoV-2's proteases inhibitors show a number of new compounds with excellent binding affinities. Anti-inflammatory drugs Montelukast, Ebastine and Solumedrol, the anti-migraine drug Vazegepant or the anti-MRSA pro-drug TAK-599, among many others, all show remarkable affinities to 3CLpro and with known side effects present candidates for immediate clinical trials. This study reports thorough docking scores summary of COVID19-related compounds found in the PubChem database and illustrates the asset of computational screening methods in search for possible drug-like candidates. Several yet-untested compounds show affinities on par with reported inhibitors and warrant further attention.

Currently, the COVID-19 epidemic that had largely subsided during last summer is resurging in Hamburg and in other parts of the world, underlining the need for additional tools to monitor SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. AIM: We aimed to develop and validate a simple, low-cost assay for detecting antibodies against the native coronavirus 2 spike protein (CoV-2 S) that does not require recombinant protein or virus. METHOD: We transiently co-transfected HEK cells or CHO cells with expression vectors encoding CoV-2 S and nuclear GFP. Spike protein-specific antibodies in human serum samples bound to transfected cells were detected with fluorochrome conjugated secondary antibodies by flow cytometry orimmunofluorescence microscopy. We applied this assay to monitor antibody development in COVID-19 patients, household contacts, and hospital personnel during the ongoing epidemic in the city state of Hamburg. RESULTS: All recovered COVID-19 patients showed high levels of CoV-2 S-specific antibodies. With one exception, all household members that did not develop symptoms also did not develop detectable antibodies. Similarly, lab personnel that worked during the epidemic and followed social distancing guidelines remained antibody-negative. CONCLUSION: We conclude that high-titer CoV-2 S-specific antibodies are found in most recovered COVID-19 patients and in symptomatic contacts, but only rarely in asymptomatic contacts. The assay may help health care providers to monitor disease progression and antibody responses in vaccination trials, to identify health care personnel that likely are resistant to re-infection, and recovered individuals with high antibody titers that may be suitable asplasma and/or antibody donors.","Hambach, Julia; Stähler, Tobias; Eden, Thomas; Wendt, Dorte; Tode, Natalie; Haag, Friedrich; Tolosa, Eva; Altfeld, Marcus; Fathi, Anahita; Dahlke, Christine; Addo, Marylyn M; Menzel, Stephan; Koch-Nolte, Friedrich",Immun.

We ran a survey of parents who had at least one child aged 3 to 17 years old living in the United Kingdom. We received 384 valid responses, which were analysed via a variance-based structural equation modeling approach to test our hypotheses. The results revealed that COVID-19 perceptions effects were Janus-faced. While they indirectly and negatively impact healthy eating behavior mediated by triggering negative experiences during the pandemic, COVID-19 perceptions, however, directly get parents, especially fathers, more engaged into healthy eating behavior - making COVID-19 perceptions total effects positive on healthy eating behavior. This explorative model is novel in the sense that it is the first of its kind to cast light on how parental healthy eating behavior can be shaped in pandemic time. The research is particularly timely due to the uncertain times in which the research is situated, that is, the worldwide pandemic (also termed COVID-19); the paper highlights how family eating practices can undergo dramatic shifts during acute crises.","Mahmoud, Ali B; Hack-Polay, Dieu; Fuxman, Leonora; Nicoletti, Maria",Scand J Psychol,389,1

METHODS: Cross-sectional study of CSF neuroinflammatory profiles from 18 COVID-19 subjects with neurological complications categorized by diagnosis (stroke, encephalopathy, headache) and illness severity. COVID-19 CSF was compared with CSF from healthy, infectious and neuroinflammatory disorders and stroke controls (n = 82). Cytokines (IL-6, TNF&#945;, IFNÎ³, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A), inflammation and coagulation markers (high-sensitivity-C Reactive Protein [hsCRP], ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, Factor VIII) and neurofilament light chain (NF-L), were quantified. SARS-CoV2 RNA and SARS-CoV2 IgG and IgA antibodies in CSF were tested with RT-PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: CSF from COVID-19 subjects showed absence of pleocytosis or specific increases in pro-inflammatory markers (IL-6, ferritin, or D-dimer). Although pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF&#945;, IL-12p70) and IL-10 were increased in CSF of stroke COVID-19 subjects, a similar increase was observed in non-COVID-19 stroke subjects. Anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies in CSF of COVID-19 subjects (77%) were observed despite no evidence of SARS-CoV2 viral RNA. CSF-NF-L was elevated in subjects with stroke and critical COVID-19 as compared to controls and other COVID-19 severity categories. CSF-hsCRP was present in all subjects with critical stages of COVID-19 (7/18) but only in 1/82 controls. CONCLUSION: The paucity of neuroinflammatory changes in CSF of COVID-19 subjects and lack of SARS-CoV2 RNA do not support the presumed neurovirulence of SARS-CoV2 or neuroinflammation in pathogenesis of neurological complications in COVID-19. The role of CSF SARS-CoV2 IgG antibodies and mechanisms of neuronal damage are still undetermined.","Garcia, Maria A; Barreras, Paula V; Lewis, Allie; Pinilla, Gabriel; Sokoll, Lori J; Kickler, Thomas; Mostafa, Heba; Caturegli, Mario; Moghekar, Abhay; Fitzgerald, Kathryn C; Pardo, Carlos A",J Neurol Sci,389,16

Thus, we predicted that levels of well-being would show minimal change in the first 4 months of COVID-19, with older adults faring better than younger adults. Adults (N = 325, M age = 39.7, SD = 12.3) were surveyed before the pandemic began and at four additional time points throughout the first 4 months of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. Participants provided demographic information and completed measures of positive and negative affect. Latent growth curves were used to analyze changes in well-being over time, with age as a covariate. There was a significant linear increase in positive affect. Older age was positively associated with initial levels, but age was not associated with the slope. There was a significant curvilinear pattern in negative affect, with an initial increase, which, although remaining elevated, exhibited slow decreases over time. Age was significantly and negatively associated with initial negative affect, but age did not influence the shape or rate of change over time. We detected changes in both positive affect and negative affect during the first 4 months of COVID-19. The magnitude of these changes suggests that the stress of COVID-19 does not lead to an immediate decrease in well-being. Moreover, although older adults showed higher positive affect and lower negative affect relative to other adults, age differences in the trajectory of change did not emerge. Delayed and long-term effects on well-being and whether those effects are age-invariant should be examined over longer periods of time.","Ebert, Alexandria R; Bernstein, Laura E; Carney, Amy Knepple; Patrick, Julie Hicks",J Adult Dev,389,16

DESIGN: Data resource comprising linked person level records from national healthcare settings for the English population, accessible within NHS Digital's new trusted research environment. SETTING: EHRs from primary care, hospital episodes, death registry, covid-19 laboratory test results, and community dispensing data, with further enrichment planned from specialist intensive care, cardiovascular, and covid-19 vaccination data. PARTICIPANTS: 54.4 million people alive on 1 January 2020 and registered with an NHS general practitioner in England. MAIN MEASURES OF INTEREST: Confirmed and suspected covid-19 diagnoses, exemplar cardiovascular conditions (incident stroke or transient ischaemic attack and incident myocardial infarction) and all cause mortality between 1 January and 31 October 2020. RESULTS: The linked cohort includes more than 96% of the English population. By combining person level data across national healthcare settings, data on age, sex, and ethnicity are complete for around 95% of the population. Among 53.3 million people with no previous diagnosis of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, 98 721 had a first ever incident stroke or transient ischaemic attack between 1 January and 31 October 2020, of which 30% were recorded only in primary care and 4% only in death registry records. Among 53.2 million people with no previous diagnosis of myocardial infarction, 62 966 had an incident myocardial infarction during follow-up, of which 8% were recorded only in primary care and 12% only in death registry records. A total of 959 470 people had a confirmed or suspected covid-19 diagnosis (714 162 in primary care data, 126 349 in hospital admission records, 776 503 in covid-19 laboratory test data, and 50 504 in death registry records). Although 58% of these were recorded in both primary care and covid-19 laboratory test data, 15% and 18%, respectively, were recorded in only one. CONCLUSIONS: This population-wide resource shows the importance of linking person level data across health settings to maximise completeness of key characteristics and to ascertain cardiovascular events and covid-19 diagnoses. Although this resource was initially established to support research on covid-19 and cardiovascular disease to benefit clinical care and public health and to inform healthcare policy, it can broaden further to enable a wide range of research.","Wood, Angela; Denholm, Rachel; Hollings, Sam; Cooper, Jennifer; Ip, Samantha; Walker, Venexia; Denaxas, Spiros; Akbari, Ashley; Banerjee, Amitava; Whiteley, William; Lai, Alvina; Sterne, Jonathan; Sudlow, Cathie",BMJ,389,1

However, to our knowledge, SARS-COV2 infection inducing such an alteration has reported only in a few series. Objectif To describe a case series of patients developing SLG alteration after SARS-COV2 infection. Method It was a prospective study (February2020 - March 2020), performed in the cardiology and pneumology departments of Mahdia Hospital-Tunisia. We included in this study, young patients without any medical history, developing SLG alteration after SARS-COV2 infection. For each patient, we assessed the SLG at the acute phase of SARS-Cov 2 infection (SLG initial: SLGi) and at one month after infection recovery (SLG control: SLGc). The comparison between SLGi and SLGc was based on delta SLG (=SLGc-SLGi) and Mc Nemar test. Continuous data were expressed as mean+-SD [min-max] and dichutomous variables were expressed as number (percentage). Results A total of 34 patients were included in the study. The sex ratio M/F was 0.45. The mean age was 34.9± 8.0 years [19-47]. The mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was 25.7 [19–29]. The severity grade of SARS-cov2 infection was 11%;3%;83%;3% for severe, moderate, mild and asymptomatic, respectively. The SLGi varied from −11% to −18.1% with a mean value at −16.24%. During the second visit, the SLGc was normal in 15 Patients (44.1%). The mean absolute delta SLG was 2.5±1.8. Mac Nemar test showed a significant improvement of SLG one month after SRS-COV 2 recovery (P&lt;10̄3: SLGi versus SLGc). Conclusion We reported here an original case series of SLG alteration induced by SARS-COV2 infection. However, this affection seems to be spontaneously reversible with the total extinction of symptoms several weeks after SARS-COV2 infection recovery.","Salma, K.; Hassen, I. H. A.; Imen, T.; Fares, B.

Virtual reality (VR) is an immersive technology that may provide effective behavioral therapeutics for chronic pain. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to conduct a double-blind, parallel-arm, single-cohort, remote, randomized placebo-controlled trial for a self-administered behavioral skills-based VR program in community-based individuals with self-reported chronic low back pain during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A national online convenience sample of individuals with self-reported nonmalignant low back pain with duration of 6 months or more and with average pain intensity of 4 or more/10 was enrolled and randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 daily (56-day) VR programs: (1) EaseVRx (immersive pain relief skills VR program); or (2) Sham VR (2D nature content delivered in a VR headset). Objective device use data and self-reported data were collected. The primary outcomes were the between-group effect of EaseVRx versus Sham VR across time points, and the between-within interaction effect representing the change in average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, stress, mood, and sleep over time (baseline to end-of-treatment at day 56). Secondary outcomes were global impression of change and change in physical function, sleep disturbance, pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance, pain medication use, and user satisfaction. Analytic methods included intention-to-treat and a mixed-model framework. RESULTS: The study sample was 179 adults (female: 76.5%, 137/179; Caucasian: 90.5%, 162/179; at least some college education: 91.1%, 163/179; mean age: 51.5 years [SD 13.1]; average pain intensity: 5/10 [SD 1.2]; back pain duration &#8805;5 years: 67%, 120/179). No group differences were found for any baseline variable or treatment engagement. User satisfaction ratings were higher for EaseVRx versus Sham VR (P<.001). For the between-groups factor, EaseVRx was superior to Sham VR for all primary outcomes (highest P value=.009), and between-groups Cohen d effect sizes ranged from 0.40 to 0.49, indicating superiority was moderately clinically meaningful. For EaseVRx, large pre-post effect sizes ranged from 1.17 to 1.3 and met moderate to substantial clinical importance for reduced pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress. Between-group comparisons for Physical Function and Sleep Disturbance showed superiority for the EaseVRx group versus the Sham VR group (P=.022 and .013, respectively). Pain catastrophizing, pain self-efficacy, pain acceptance, prescription opioid use (morphine milligram equivalent) did not reach statistical significance for either group. Use of over-the-counter analgesic use was reduced for EaseVRx (P<.01) but not for Sham VR. CONCLUSIONS: EaseVRx had high user satisfaction and superior and clinically meaningful symptom reduction for average pain intensity and pain-related interference with activity, mood, and stress compared to sham VR. Additional research is needed to determine durability of treatment effects and to characterize mechanisms of treatment effects. Home-based VR may expand access to effective and on-demand nonpharmacologic treatment for chronic low back pain.

Next, these data were used to create a regression model to estimate the reduction in aerosol concentration as distance from a source increased. Finally, these regression models were applied to conceptual aircraft seating scenarios to simulate the reduction in exposure resulting from vacant middle seats in an aircraft cabin. Based on laboratory modeling of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 on single-aisle and twin-aisle aircraft, exposures in scenarios in which the middle seat was vacant were reduced by 23% to 57%, compared with full aircraft occupancy, depending upon the model.

METHODS: Two observers independently examined the CT images of COVID-19 patients, and the SCT severity score was calculated. The SCT score was calculated as the sum of values ranging from 0 to 4, according to the volumetric rate of involvement for each lung lobe. In quantitative assessment, total lung volume (TLV) was automatically calculated from CT density values between -200 and -950 HU. Besides, healthy lung volume (HLV) was calculated from voxels between -800 and -950 HU. The QCT score was calculated with the following formula: (TLV - HLV / TLV) ×100. All patients were clinically divided into four groups: mild, common, severe, and critical. Interobserver agreement for SCT assessment was investigated using the Cohen's Kappa statistics (&#954;). Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for the relationship between continuous data. The diagnostic accuracy of SCT and QCT in the differentiation of clinically limited (mild, common) and extensive (severe, critical) disease was investigated using ROC analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. There was good agreement between the two observers in the SCT evaluation of pulmonary disease severity (&#954; = 0.796; 95% CI, 0.751-0.841). A significant correlation was found between QCT and SCT scores (P < 0.001, r = 0.661). Both QCT and SCT scores showed a significant correlation with clinical severity score (P < 0.001, r = 0.620 and P = 0.004, r = 0.529, respectively). The ROC analysis revealed the AUC of QCT and SCT for differentiation of limited and extensive disease as 0.873 (95% CI, 0.774-0.972) and 0.816 (95% CI, 0.673-0.959), respectively. CONCLUSION: The QCT assessment is an objective method in the evaluation of COVID-19 severity and is more successful than semiquantitative CT assessment to discriminate extensive from limited disease.","Ufuk, Furkan; Demirci, Mahmut; Ugurlu, Erhan; Çetin, Nazli; Yigit, Nilüfer; Sari, Tugba",Diagn. interv. radiol,389,16

Although the mutation at the population level had been extensively investigated, how the mutations evolve at the individual level is largely unknown. Eighteen time-series fecal samples were collected from nine patients with COVID-19 during the convalescent phase. The nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 were enriched by the hybrid capture method. First, we demonstrated the outstanding performance of the hybrid capture method in detecting intra-host variants. We identified 229 intra-host variants at 182 sites in 18 fecal samples. Among them, nineteen variants presented frequency changes >0.3 within 1-5 days, reflecting highly dynamic intra-host viral populations. Moreover, the evolution of the viral genome demonstrated that the virus was probably viable in the gastrointestinal tract during the convalescent period.

Despite the controversy around the clinical benefits of HCQ, the existence of a chiral center in the molecule to possess two optical isomers suggests that there might be an enantiomeric difference on the treatment of COVID-19. Due to their poor resolution and the inability of quantification by previously reported methods for the analysis of HCQ enantiomers, it is necessary to develop an analytical method to achieve baseline separation for quantitative and accurate determination of the enantiomeric purity in order to compare the efficacy and toxicity profiles of different enantiomers. In this study, we developed and validated an accurate and reproducible normal phase chiral high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for the analysis of two enantiomers of HCQ, and the method was further evaluated with biological samples. With this newly developed method, the relative standard deviations of all analytes were lower than 5%, and the limits of quantification were 0.27 µg/ml, 0.34 µg/ml and 0.20 µg/ml for racemate, R- and S-enantiomer, respectively.

We present the evolution in cases and deaths according to epidemiological weeks. We analyzed the series of accumulated daily confirmed COVID-19 cases, with projections for the subsequent 15 days, using the JoinPoint app. This software allows identifying turning points, testing their statistical significance. We also analyze the trend in the spread of COVID-19 to the interior of the state, considering the percent distribution of cases in the state capital, Recife, municipalities in Greater Metropolitan Recife, and the state's interior, by sets of three weeks, constructing thematic maps. The first hundred days of the COVID-19 epidemic resulted in 52,213 cases and 4,235 deaths from March 12, or epidemiological week 11, until June 20, 2020 (epidemiological week 25). The peak in the epidemic curve occurred in epidemiological week 21 (May 23), followed by deceleration in the number of cases. We initially detected the spread of cases from the city center to the periphery of the state capital and Metropolitan Area, followed by rapid spread to the state's interior. There was a decrease in the mean daily growth starting in April, but with an average threshold of more than 6,000 weekly cases of COVID-19.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have proved their capability in time series forecasting non-linear problems. In the present study, the relationship between weather factor and COVID-19 cases was assessed, and also developed a forecasting model using long short-term memory (LSTM), a deep learning model. The study found that the specific humidity has a strong positive correlation, whereas there is a negative correlation with maximum temperature, and a positive correlation with minimum temperature was observed in various geographic locations of India. The weather data and COVID-19 confirmed case data (1 April to 30 June 2020) were used to optimize univariate and multivariate LSTM time series forecast models. The optimized models were utilized to forecast the daily COVID-19 cases for the period 1 July 2020 to 31 July 2020 with 1 to 14 days of lead time. The results showed that the univariate LSTM model was reasonably good for the short-term (1 day lead) forecast of COVID-19 cases (relative error <20%). Moreover, the multivariate LSTM model improved the medium-range forecast skill (1-7 days lead) after including the weather factors. The study observed that the specific humidity played a crucial role in improving the forecast skill majorly in the West and northwest region of India.

The effects of those interventions on hospital use have not been systematically evaluated. The investigation could provide data-driven evidence to potentially improve the implementation of public health interventions in the future. OBJECTIVE: We aim to study two representative areas in the United States and one area in China (New York State, Ohio State, and Hubei Province), and investigate the effects of their public health interventions by time periods according to key interventions. METHODS: This observational study evaluated the numbers of infected, hospitalized, and death cases in New York and Ohio from March 16 through September 14, 2020, and Hubei from January 26 to March 31, 2020. We developed novel Bayesian generalized compartmental models. The clinical stages of COVID-19 were stratified in the models, and the effects of public health interventions were modeled through piecewise exponential functions. Time-dependent transmission rates and effective reproduction numbers were estimated. The associations of interventions and the numbers of required hospital and intensive care unit beds were studied. RESULTS: The interventions of social distancing, home confinement, and wearing masks significantly decreased (in a Bayesian sense) the case incidence and reduced the demand for beds in all areas. Ohio's transmission rates declined before the state's ""stay at home"" order, which provided evidence that early intervention is important. Wearing masks was significantly associated with reducing the transmission rates after reopening, when comparing New York and Ohio. The centralized quarantine intervention in Hubei played a significant role in further preventing and controlling the disease in that area. The estimated rates that cured patients become susceptible in all areas were small (<0.0001), which indicates that they have little chance to get the infection again. CONCLUSIONS: The series of public health interventions in three areas were temporally associated with the burden of COVID-19-attributed hospital use. Social distancing and the use of face masks should continue to prevent the next peak of the pandemic.","Wang, Xiaofeng; Ren, Rui; Kattan, Michael W; Jehi, Lara; Cheng, Zhenshun; Fang, Kuangnan",JMIR Public Health Surveill,389,23

Previous studies have found that air pollution is a risk factor for respiratory infection by carrying microorganisms and affecting body's immunity. This study aimed to explore the relationship between ambient air pollutants and the infection caused by the novel coronavirus. Daily confirmed cases, air pollution concentration and meteorological variables in 120 cities were obtained from January 23, 2020 to February 29, 2020 in China. We applied a generalized additive model to investigate the associations of six air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2 and O3) with COVID-19 confirmed cases. We observed significantly positive associations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3 in the last two weeks with newly COVID-19 confirmed cases. A 10-µg/m3 increase (lag0-14) in PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3 was associated with a 2.24% (95% CI: 1.02 to 3.46), 1.76% (95% CI: 0.89 to 2.63), 6.94% (95% CI: 2.38 to 11.51), and 4.76% (95% CI: 1.99 to 7.52) increase in the daily counts of confirmed cases, respectively. However, a 10-µg/m3 increase (lag0-14) in SO2 was associated with a 7.79% decrease (95% CI: -14.57 to -1.01) in COVID-19 confirmed cases. Our results indicate that there is a significant relationship between air pollution and COVID-19 infection, which could partially explain the effect of national lockdown and provide implications for the control and prevention of this novel disease.","Zhu, Yongjian; Xie, Jingui; Huang, Fengming; Cao, Liqing",Sci Total Environ,389,20

ICIs work through the blockage of immune inhibitory signals, while increasing the T-cell specific immune antitumoral response. However, due to the fact that ICIs' mechanism of action is not tissue antigen-specific and not limited to the tumor microenvironment, the use of cancer immunotherapy can produce a broad range of immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Neurological immune-related adverse events (NirAEs) are rare (the overall incidence varies between 1% to 6%), and these adverse events mainly concern the peripheral nervous system, rather than the central nervous system. Due to their potential severity, which could cause interruptions to cancer treatment, NirAEs are of particular clinical importance. Currently, the pathogenesis of these complications is not completely understood, although T-cells seem to play a principal role. Nevertheless, the development of NirAEs is likely to be a multifactorial and complex process. This conclusion can be extracted from the wide range of neurological auto-inflammatory and autoimmune disorders triggered or exacerbated by ICIs, and the extensive variability of the limited histological findings reported. The aim of this review is to summarize the potential immune-driven pathological mechanisms of NirAEs.","Vilariño, Noelia; Bruna, Jordi; Kalofonou, Foteini; Anastopoulou, Garifallia G; Argyriou, Andreas A",,389,5

There is a growing recognition that dynamic qualitative and quantitative differences in immunity over development contribute to these observations. The liver plays a key role as an immunologic organ, but whether its contribution to the acute innate immune response changes over lifetime is unknown. We hypothesized that the liver would activate a developmentally-regulated acute innate immune response to intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We first assessed the hepatic expression and activity of the NF-&#954;B, a key regulator of the innate immune response, at different developmental ages (p0, p3, p7, p35, and adult). Ontogeny of the NF-&#954;B subunits (p65/p50) revealed a reduction in Rela (p65) and Nfkb1 (p105, precursor to p50) gene expression (p0) and p65 subunit protein levels (p0 and p3) vs. older ages. The acute hepatic innate immune response to LPS was associated by the degradation of the NF-&#954;B inhibitory proteins (I&#954;B&#945; and I&#954;Bß), and nuclear translocation of the NF-&#954;B subunit p50 in all ages, whereas nuclear translocation of the NF-&#954;B subunit p65 was only observed in the p35 and adult mouse. Consistent with these findings, we detected NF-&#954;B subunit p65 nuclear staining exclusively in the LPS-exposed adult liver compared with p7 mouse. We next interrogated the LPS-induced hepatic expression of pro-inflammatory genes (Tnf, Icam1, Ccl3, and Traf1), and observed a gradually increase in gene expression starting from p0. Confirming our results, hepatic NF-&#954;B subunit p65 nuclear translocation was associated with up-regulation of the Icam1 gene in the adult, and was not detected in the p7 mouse. Thus, an inflammatory challenge induces an NF-&#954;B-mediated hepatic innate immune response activation across all developmental ages, but nuclear translocation of the NF-&#954;B subunit p65 and associated induction of pro-inflammatory genes occurred only after the first month of life. Our results demonstrate that the LPS-induced hepatic innate immune response is developmentally regulated by the NF-&#954;B subunit p65 in the mouse.","Zarate, Miguel A; Nguyen, Leanna M; De Dios, Robyn K; Zheng, Lijun; Wright, Clyde J",Front Immunol,389,1

Two important products of tryptophan metabolism, viz kynurenine and interleukin (IL)4-inducible1 (IL41)-driven indole 3 pyruvate (I3P), activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), thereby altering the nature of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. AhR activation dysregulates the initial pro-inflammatory cytokines production driven by neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells, whilst AhR activation suppresses the endogenous antiviral responses of natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells. Such immune responses become further dysregulated by the increased and prolonged pro-inflammatory cytokine suppression of pineal melatonin production coupled to increased gut dysbiosis and gut permeability. The suppression of pineal melatonin and gut microbiome-derived butyrate, coupled to an increase in circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) further dysregulates the immune response. The AhR mediates its effects via alterations in the regulation of mitochondrial function in immune cells. The increased risk of severe/fatal SARS-CoV-2 infection by high risk conditions, such as elderly age, obesity, and diabetes are mediated by these conditions having expression levels of melatonin, AhR, butyrate, and LPS that are closer to those driven by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This has a number of future research and treatment implications, including the utilization of melatonin and nutraceuticals that inhibit the AhR, including the polyphenols, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and resveratrol.","Anderson, George; Carbone, Annalucia; Mazzoccoli, Gianluigi",Int. j. mol. sci.

Specifically, immunosuppression and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are two important risk factors. This case report describes the rehabilitation course of a 62-yr-old woman with a history of a double lung transplant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2016 who contracted a severe COVID-19 infection. After nearly a month in the intensive care unit, she underwent a 10-day course of inpatient rehabilitation and regained substantial independence and was able to return home only needing supervision. Although other cases in the rehabilitation literature have documented successful rehabilitation after COVID-19 infection, this transplant-related case required intensive coordination of care to meet goals and achieve success for the patient. Because of the limited numbers of studies, this information may prove valuable in future considerations for candidates of inpatient rehabilitation.","Nicolosi, Christian; Barber, Kristina; Draganich, Christina; Niehaus, William",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,389,5

However, few studies have evaluated factors that lead to increased detection of deposition or the individual differences among patients. OBJECTIVE: To measure the effect of repeated dosages of gadopentetate dimeglumine on pediatric brains and to determine the factors that influence signal intensity changes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study evaluated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients <18 years of age who received >5 doses of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Regions of interest were placed in 30 locations in the brain on axial precontrast T1 images. Signal intensity ratios were evaluated throughout the brain. The effect of increasing gadopentetate dimeglumine exposure on signal intensity ratios was assessed using linear mixed models adjusted for gender, age, imaging sequence type (fast spin echo or gradient echo), MRI manufacturer (General Electric, Philips or Siemens), and field strength (1.5 tesla [T] or 3 T). Finally, the variance of the random slope in the linear mixed models was tested to determine if there were differences in the rate of signal intensity ratio change among individuals. RESULTS: Fifty patients (M:F=25:25; mean age at first imaging: 6.4 years) with a mean of 21.5 gadopentetate dimeglumine administrations (range: 6-86) were included. There were significant increases in T1 signal in the globus pallidus, dentate nucleus and pulvinar with an increasing number of contrast administrations. Patient gender, age, and MRI field strength were not associated with changing signal intensity ratios. However, MRI sequence type and vendor significantly impacted some measured signal intensity ratios. Finally, significant differences in the slopes of the ratios were present among patients for multiple locations. CONCLUSION: Repeated administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine is associated with T1 hyperintense signal in the dentate nucleus, globus pallidus and pulvinar. Detection is significantly affected by MRI sequence type and scanner vendor. Even when accounting for these differences, there are individual differences in the slope of signal intensity change suggesting a patient-level effect influences gadolinium deposition.","Towbin, Alexander J; Zhang, Bin; Dillman, Jonathan R",Pediatr Radiol,389,24

Italy is immersed in the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the world will soon follow. The United States currently has the most documented cases of COVID-19 of any nation. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-associated acute cardiomyopathy is common in critical care patients and is associated with a high mortality rate. Patients with COVID-19 frequently require mechanical support for adequate oxygenation. A severe shortfall of ventilators is predicted. Of equal concern is the projected shortage of trained professionals required to care for patients on mechanical ventilation. Ultrasonography is proving to be a valuable tool for identifying the pulmonary manifestations and progression of COVID-19. Lung ultrasound also facilitates successful weaning from mechanical ventilation. Ultrasonography of the lung, pleura, and diaphragm are easily mastered by experienced echocardiographers. Echocardiography has an established role for optimal fluid management and recognition of cardiac disease, including SARS-CoV-2-associated acute cardiomyopathy. Cardiologists, anesthesiologists, sonographers, and all providers should be prepared to commit their full spectrum of skills to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic. We should also be prepared to collaborate and cross-train to expand professional services as necessary. During a declared health care crisis, providers must be familiar with the ethical principles, organizational structure, practical application, and gravity of limited resource allocation.","Drake, Daniel H; De Bonis, Michele; Covella, Michele; Agricola, Eustachio; Zangrillo, Alberto; Zimmerman, Karen G; Cobey, Frederick C",J Am Soc Echocardiogr,389,1

This study aimed to determine the effect of ACEI/ARB use in patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was done in two Saudi public specialty hospitals designated as COVID-19 referral facilities. We included 354 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between April and June 2020, of which 146 were ACEI/ARB users and 208 were non-ACEI/ARB users. Controlling for confounders, we conducted multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses using propensity score matching (PSM) and Inverse propensity score weighting (IPSW) for high-risk patient subsets. RESULTS: Compared to non-ACEI/ARB users, ACEI/ARB users had an eight-fold higher risk of developing critical or severe COVID-19 (OR = 8.25, 95%CI = 3.32-20.53); a nearly 7-fold higher risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR = 6.76, 95%CI = 2.88-15.89) and a nearly 5-fold higher risk of requiring noninvasive ventilation (OR = 4.77,95%CI = 2.15-10.55). Patients with diabetes, hypertension, and/or renal disease had a five-fold higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease (OR = 5.40,95%CI = 2.0-14.54]. These results were confirmed in the PSM and IPSW analyses.

This may have caused particular challenges for students with disabilities. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe the availability of remote instruction and counseling resources on the disability/accessibility websites of colleges and universities in the greater New York City area. At the time this study was conducted, this region was the global COVID-19 epicenter. METHODS: All colleges/universities in the New York City metropolitan area were identified using Petersen's online search guide. Descriptive information (institution's name, size, and location) was recorded. The disability/accessibility pages of websites were located and examined for remote instructional resources for both educators and for students, a way to make an appointment with the counseling center (phone number and/or email address), and a link to the counseling center. Descriptive statistics were recorded (percentages of small, medium, large size institutions, mean, median, range and standard deviations of enrollments, and number and percentage of institutions that provided online accessibility resources) and one-sided Chi square tests were conducted to test the relationship between school size and the availability of resources. RESULTS: 17% of the colleges/universities had no link to disability/accessibility services on their websites. Of the remaining 127 institutions, few made the aforementioned resources available on the disability/accessibility page. The most prevalent resource observed was providing students with remote instruction assistance. The association between school size and the aforementioned resources was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Making information available to students with disabilities is a fundamental part of accessibility in higher education. Doing so is all the more necessary given the challenges wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic, challenges which are likely to continue for years to come.","Meleo-Erwin, Zoë; Kollia, Betty; Fera, Joe; Jahren, Alyssa; Basch, Corey",Disabil Health J,389,24

There is only limited data about the clinical features of COVID-19 during pregnancy, especially in first trimester. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a COVID-19 infection in a 35 years-old patient in first trimester of pregnancy and its consequent medical care. At 7 weeks of pregnancy, the patient, who did not have any pregestational comorbidities, complained of intense nausea and asthenia. An important liver cytolysis was discovered with biological perturbations of transaminases levels. No respiratory symptoms were recorded. Classical viral aetiologies and drug-related toxicity were discarded. Because of the aggravation of the symptoms and the occurrence of the breathlessness, the patient was tested for the COVID-19 in a nasopharyngeal swab. The RTq-PCR assay indicated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In the absence of severe symptoms, the patient was monitored at home according to the French government guidelines. After a few days, the symptoms resolved without any complications. The pregnancy is still ongoing without any visible sequelae on the foetus so far. CONCLUSIONS: This first case illustrated the difficulty of COVID-19 diagnosis in patients with isolated digestive symptoms in first trimester of pregnancy that could be confused with gravida hyperemesis. Monitoring of pregnancy after an episode of COVID-19 should be strengthened with bimonthly foetal growth ultrasounds and doppler assessments because of the risks for intrauterine growth restriction. Comprehensive data on larger numbers of first trimester gravid women with COVID-19 are required to better understanding the overall impact of SARS-CoV-2 on maternal and birth outcomes.","Lamazou, F; Oger, P; Dieli-Crimi, R; Guerin, A; Letouzey, V; Octernaud, S; Place, V; Calès, P; Descamps, P; Delaroche, L",BMC Infect Dis,389,16

FINDINGS: We found compelling evidence of ongoing replication and infectivity for up to 162 days from initial positive by subgenomic RNA, single-stranded RNA, and viral culture analysis. Our results reveal a broad spectrum of infectivity, host immune responses, and accumulation of mutations, some with the potential for immune escape. INTERPRETATION: Our results highlight the potential need to reassess infection control precautions in the management and care of immunocompromised patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 104 patients with ALD were examined: 15 (14.4%) with liver steatosis (LS), 19 (18.3%) with steatohepatitis and 70 (67.3%) with liver cirrhosis (LC); men 50 (48.1%), women 54 (51.9%); age 45.78.4 years. Traditional clinical, laboratory, instrumental studies were performed, the levels of fragments of cytokeratin-18 (FCK-18), cytokines IL-1, TNF-, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 were determined by ELISA. The control group consisted of 39 healthy individuals: men 20 (51.2%), women 19 (48.7%), age 48.58.3 years. RESULTS: In LS, an increase in the level of FCK-18 was noted with normal aminotransferase activity, the content of TNF-, IL-6, IL-1, IL-8 increased and the level of IL-4 decreased compared to those in healthy individuals. In steatohepatitis, a triple increase in aminotransferases and FCK-18 was observed compared with LS, as well as an increase in the level of inflammatory mediators, to a greater extent IL-6, to a lesser extent IL-8, TNF-, a decrease in IL-4, IL-1 remained at the same level. In LC, there was a further increase in FCK-18, significantly more pronounced than an increase in AST, and the increase in cytokines continued to the same extent, the levels of IL-6 and IL-8, to a lesser extent IL-1 and TNF-, and the level of IL-4. CONCLUSION: With the progression of ALD from LS to steatohepatitis, hepatic cell damage was carried out by equally pronounced processes of hepatocyte necrosis and apoptosis, with the development of cirrhosis of the liver, parenchyma damage occurred mainly due to hepatocyte apoptosis. The immuno-inflammatory process progressively increased from the stage of LS to LC with IL-6 and IL-8 undergoing the greatest dynamics. FCK-18 can serve as a non-invasive marker of hepatic cell damage, and IL-6 and IL-8 markers of immune inflammation in ALD.","Rodina, A S; Shubina, M E; Kurbatova, I V; Topchieva, L V; Dudanova, O P",Ter Arkh,389,23

In the hospital environment, certain high-risk procedures have the potential to cause transmission of the virus to health-care workers and nosocomial transmission to patients through different mechanisms including the generation of aerosols and fomite formation via contamination of medical devices.Areas covered: Aerosol-generating procedures such as bronchoscopy are considered high risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission. As a result, single-use devices should be used where possible and changing to single-use flexible bronchoscopes has been advised by respiratory societies internationally. In this paper, we outline the rationale for this advice and have analyzed the evidence relating to the reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission arising from a switch to these single-use devices and the potential impact that this switch may have on the quality of pulmonology services.Expert opinion: In this paper, we outline the rationale for this advice and have analyzed the evidence relating to the reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission arising from a switch to these single-use devices and the potential impact that this switch may have on the quality of pulmonology services.","Barron, Sarah; Kennedy, Marcus Peter",Expert Rev Med Devices,389,18

Although the elicitation of humoral responses against different viral proteins is rapid and occurs in most infected individuals, its magnitude is highly variable among them and positively correlates with COVID-19 disease severity. This rapid response is characterized by the almost concomitant appearance of virus-specific IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies that contain neutralizing antibodies directed against different epitopes of the Spike glycoprotein. Of particularly interest, the antibodies against domain of the Spike that interacts with the cellular receptor ACE2, known as the receptor binding domain (RBD), are present in most infected individuals and are block viral entry and infectivity. Such neutralizing antibodies protect different animal species when administered before virus exposure; therefore, its elicitation is the main target of current vaccine approaches and their clinical use as recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is being explored. Yet, little information exists on the duration of humoral responses during natural infection. This is a key issue that will impact the management of the pandemic and determine the utility of seroconversion studies and the level of herd immunity. Certainly, several cases of reinfection have been reported, suggesting that immunity could be transient, as reported for other coronaviruses. In summary, although the kinetics of the generation of antibodies against SASR-CoV-2 and their protective activity have been clearly defined, their role in COVID-19 pathogenesis and the length of these responses are still open questions.","Carrillo, Jorge; Izquierdo-Useros, Nuria; Ávila-Nieto, Carlos; Pradenas, Edwards; Clotet, Bonaventura; Blanco, Julià",,389,25

Although the exact mechanism of extensive thromboembolism and myocardial injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 is not illuminated, it is clear that COVID-19 related hypercoagulation increasing the fatality of the disease. Herein, we reported a patient with extensive biventricular thrombi along with the new-onset severe systolic dysfunction as an unusual catastrophic presentation of COVID-19. In our patient, there was both a right atrial ""clot in transit"" from his DVT as well as extensive muralized biventricular thrombus from severe global hypokinesis. We believe that the hypercoagulable state of his COVID-19 infection, along with severe systolic dysfunction, caused this unusual presentation. Although the hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 is well recognized, there have not been any reported cases of extensive de-novo intracardiac thrombus as of yet.

Here we reflect on how our integrated organisational model has faced the first impact of the pandemic and describe what challenges, opportunities and lessons have emerged. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The organisational model of the Catalan Blood and Tissue Bank (Banc de Sang i Teixits, BST) is described. The new scenario was managed by following international recommendations and considering the pandemic in a context of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA), allowing rapid measures to be taken. These aimed to: ensure donor safety, promote proper responses to patients' needs, ensure the health and well-being of personnel, and prepare for future scenarios. RESULTS: The BST has adapted its activities to the changes in demand. No shortage of any product or service occurred. Donor acceptance, safety and wellbeing were maintained except for tissue donation, which almost completely stopped. To support the health system, several activities have been promoted: large-scale convalescent plasma (CP) production, clinical trials with CP and mesenchymal stromal cells, massive COVID-19 diagnoses, and participation in co-operative research and publications. Haemovigilance is running smoothly and no adverse effects have been detected among donors or patients. DISCUSSION: Several elements have proven to be critical when addressing the pandemic scenario: a) the early creation of a crisis committee in combination with technical recommendations and the recognition of a VUCA scenario; b) identification of the strategies described; c) the integrated donor-to-patient organisational model; d) active Research and Development (R&D); and e) the flexibility of the staff. It is essential to underline the importance of the need for centralised management, effective contingency strategies, and early collaboration with peers.","Garcia-Lopez, Joan; Delgadillo, Joaquin; Vilarrodona, Anna; Querol, Sergi; Ovejo, Joan; Coll, Ruth; Millan, Anna; Madrigal, Alejandro; Soria, Gloria; Vidal, Francisco; Vives, Joaquim; Herrero, María J; Lopez, Isabel; Sauleda, Silvia; Contreras, Enric; Grifols, Joan Ramon; Guasch, Rosa; Tahull, Elisabet; Puig, Lluís; Masip, Aurora; Argelagués, Enric; Muñiz-Diaz, Eduardo",Blood Transfus,389,24

While the cellular recognition of well-known HDL-based carriers occurs via interactions with an HDL receptor, the selective delivery and uptake of LDL particles by target cells are more complex. The most well-known mode of LDL-based delivery is via the interaction between apolipoprotein B (Apo-B) - the main protein of LDL - and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). LDLR is expressed in the liver, adipocytes, and macrophages, and thus selectively delivers LDL carriers to these cells and tissues. Moreover, the elevated expression of LDLR in tumor cells indicates a role for LDL in the targeted delivery of chemotherapy drugs. In addition, chronic inflammation associated with hypercholesterolemia (i.e., high levels of endogenous LDL) can be abated by LDL carriers, which outcompete the deleterious oxidized LDL for uptake by macrophages. In this case, synthetic LDL nanocarriers act as 'eat-me' signals and exploit mechanisms of native LDL uptake for targeted drug delivery and imaging. Lastly, recent studies have shown that the delivery of LDL-based nanocarriers to macrophages via fluid-phase pinocytosis is a promising tool for atherosclerosis imaging. Hence, the present review summarizes the use of natural and synthetic LDL-based carriers for drug delivery and imaging and discusses various mechanisms of targeting.","Di, Lin; Maiseyeu, Andrei",Drug Deliv,389,16

In patients hospitalised for severe flare, who previously experienced multiple drug failures, including steroids and anti-TNF agents, new quick-acting medical options are needed. Tofacitinib is effective in refractory UC and has a rapid onset of action. AIM: To evaluate effectiveness and safety of tofacitinib as rescue therapy in patients hospitalised for UC flare. METHODS: We conducted an observational and multicentre study with both retrospective and prospective collections in 14 GETAID centres. The primary objective was to assess the survival without colectomy following tofacitinib initiation in patients hospitalised for a UC flare. We determined rates of clinical response, clinical remission, and steroid-free clinical remission at week 6 and week 14 and safety. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were included (49 with prior infliximab failure and 19 previously exposed to ciclosporin). With a median follow-up of 6.5 months (interquartile range [IQR] [3-12.3]), rate of colectomy-free survival was estimated at 78.9% (95 CI [68.5-90.9]) and 73.6% (95 CI [61.9-87.3]) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Rates of clinical response, clinical remission and steroid-free clinical remission were 60%, 45.5% and 37.5% at week 6 and 41.8%, 34.5% and 32.7% at week 14. Regarding safety, no death was observed, three patients withdrew tofacitinib due to adverse events. Two herpes zoster infections occurred in patients aged over 60 years old. No venous thrombotic or major adverse cardiovascular events occurred. CONCLUSION: Tofacitinib appears as a promising option in patients hospitalised with a UC flare but needs further validation in controlled trials.","Uzzan, Mathieu; Bresteau, Clément; Laharie, David; Stefanescu, Carmen; Bellanger, Christophe; Carbonnel, Franck; Serrero, Mélanie; Viennot, Stéphanie; Nachury, Maria; Amiot, Aurélien; Altwegg, Romain; Picon, Laurence; Nahon, Stéphane; Vuitton, Lucine; Ah Soune, Philippe; Kirchgesner, Julien; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent; Bouhnik, Yoram",Aliment. pharmacol. ther,389,28

We aimed to delineate distinct anxiety-response trajectories during the early stages of the pandemic and to identify baseline risk and resilience factors as predictors of anxiety responses. MethodsUsing a crowdsourcing website, we enrolled 1,362 participants, primarily from the United States (n = 1064) and Israel (n = 222) over three time-points from April-September 2020. We used latent growth mixture modeling to identify anxiety trajectories over time. Group comparison and multivariate regression models were used to examine demographic and risk and resilience factors associated with class membership. ResultsA four-class model provided the best fit. The resilient trajectory (stable low anxiety) was the most common (n = 961, 75.08%), followed by chronic anxiety (n = 149, 11.64%), recovery (n = 96, 7.50%) and delayed anxiety (n = 74, 5.78%). While COVID-19 stressors did not differ between trajectories, resilient participants were more likely to be older, living with another person and to report higher income, more education, fewer COVID-19 worries, better sleep quality, and more dispositional resilience factors at baseline. Multivariate analyses suggested that baseline emotion regulation capabilities and low conflictual relationships uniquely distinguished participants in distinct trajectories. ConclusionsConsistent with prior resilience research following major adversities, a majority of individuals showed stable low levels of low anxiety in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge about dispositional resilience factors may prospectively inform mental health trajectories early in the course of ongoing adversity.","Shilton, Tal; Mancini, Anthony D; Perlstein, Samantha; DiDomenico, Grace E; Visoki, Elina; Greenberg, David M; Brown, Lily A; Gur, Raquel E; Waller, Rebecca; Barzilay, Ran",,389,1

Our methodology is based on a specific SEIR model, called ATVBG-SEIR model, which is explained in detail. The results are especially interesting for vaccination-free society since they show what the Covid-19 mortality would be in different scenarios. We include vaccinations in the model which are carried out according to a vaccination plan provided on a daily basis. The main constraint to be accounted by the methodology is the number of Intensive Care Units (ICU) reserved for Covid-19 patients (they are e.g. about 1100 in Bulgaria, about 8000 in Germany, etc.). A Web-based Lockdown Scenarios Tool has been developed, based on the present methodology, which is available at www.atvbg-seir.eu.

Therefore, the diagnosis is challenging, and there are no recommendations regarding a specific surgical approach. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present the case of a 56-year-old woman with a De Garengeot's hernia doubly complicated: strangulated and with appendicitis in the hernia sac. The diagnosis was made intraoperatively, and it was managed fully through a single inguinal incision. No postoperative complication was presented, and the patient was discharged 48 h after. DISCUSSION: The clinical presentation of this sub-type of hernia is non-specific. Precise knowledge of the hernia sac content preoperatively is not mandatory, and it should not delay prompt emergency surgery. As long as there are no local signs of complicated appendicitis, a single inguinal incision may be sufficient to perform appendectomy and hernia repair. In the event of complicated appendicitis, an exploratory of the abdominal cavity is mandatory, and hybrid approaches are recommended. For an experienced surgeon, the laparoscopic approach (TAPP), including the treatment of the two pathologies and the exploration of the peritoneal cavity, represents the surgical technique of choice. CONCLUSION: De Garengeot's strangulated hernia with appendicitis is an exceedingly rare double surgical emergency. When uncomplicated appendicitis, a single inguinal incision is sufficient to treat both appendicitis and abdominal wall defect. Hernia reduction, which young surgeons in the emergency room commonly attempt, should be abolished.","Mejri, Atef; Omry, Ahmed; Arfaoui, Khaoula; Rchidi, Jasser",Int J Surg Case Rep,389,16

Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (eu-DKA) is a rare life-threatening complication associated with the use of SGLT2 inhibitor that may be unnoticed, particularly in a pandemic setting, due to the absence of significant hyperglycemia, delaying its treatment. In this report, we describe a case of a 56-year-old patient who presented an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis during a SARS-CoV-2 infection and was diagnosed with SGLT2-associated euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. COVID-19 may increase patients' insulin demand, present gastrointestinal symptoms, and increase the production of ketone bodies. This situation can be worsened in susceptible diabetic patients on SLGT2 inhibitors, due to the persistent glycosuria, which can cause volume depletion. Recently some authors recommended that insulin-deficient patients or those using SGLT2 inhibitors should monitor for ketosis using available home testing kits in case of infections and should discontinue the medication in case of COVID-19. Given the increased use of this drug class in the management of type 2 DM patients due to its reduction of cardiovascular risk, we set out to emphasize the importance for the medical community to consider the possibility of eu-DKA on SARS-CoV-2-infected patients using SLGT2 inhibitors, so physicians can provide these patients with appropriate therapy promptly.","Batista, Daniel Valente; Vieira, Carla Antoniana Ferreira de Almeida; Costa, Thomaz Alexandre; Lima, Eduardo Gomes",Diabetol Int,389,1

METHODS: Participants of a 1-year open-label phase 1b study of IT delivered rituximab to patients with PMS were offered extended treatment with follow-up for an additional 2 years. During the extension phase, treatment with 25 mg rituximab was administered every 6 months via a subcutaneous Ommaya reservoir connected to the right frontal horn with a ventricular catheter. RESULTS: Mild to moderate vertigo and nausea occurred in 4 out of 14 participants as temporary adverse events associated with IT rituximab infusion. During the entire 3-year period, two cases of low-virulent bacterial meningitis occurred, which were successfully treated. Walking speed deteriorated significantly during the study. CONCLUSIONS: IT administration of rituximab via a ventricular catheter was well tolerated. Considering the meningitis cases, the risk of infection was not negligible. The continued loss of walking speed indicates that IT rituximab was not able to stop disease progression. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides class IV evidence that intraventricularly administered rituximab in progressive MS is associated with a risk for bacterial meningitis and does not halt disease progression.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that COVID-19 is a pandemic having a higher spread rate rather than the mortality. Identification of a potential approach or therapy against COVID-19 is still under consideration. Therefore, it is essential to have an insight into SARS-CoV-2, its interacting partner, and domains for an effective treatment. The present study is divided into three main categories, including SARS-CoV-2 prominent receptor and its expression levels, other interacting partners, and their binding domains. The first section focuses primarily on coronaviruses' general aspects (SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses (MERS-CoV)) their structures, similarities, and mode of infections. The second section discusses the host receptors which includes the human targets of coronaviruses like dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), CD147, CD209L, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), and other miscellaneous targets (type-II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), furin, trypsin, cathepsins, thermolysin, elastase, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 5-kinase, two-pore segment channel, and epithelium sodium channel C-&#945; subunit). The human cell receptor, ACE2 plays an essential role in the Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) pathway and COVID-19. Thus, this section also discusses the ACE2 expression and risk of COVID-19 infectivity in various organs and tissues such as the liver, lungs, intestine, heart, and reproductive system in the human body. Absence of ACE2 protein expression in immune cells could be used for limiting the SARS-CoV-2 infection. The third section covers the current available approaches for COVID-19 treatment. Overall, this review focuses on the critical role of human cell receptors involved in coronavirus pathogenesis, which would likely be used in designing target-specific drugs to combat COVID-19.","Raghav, Pawan Kumar; Kalyanaraman, Keerthana; Kumar, Dinesh",Amino acids,389,21

There is evidence of increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and other interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) due to innate immune activation. These have been linked with severity of symptoms and clinical outcomes of infected patients. However, there is still little known about the expression of one particular ISG, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), more specifically ADAR1p150 isoform that in addition to its role in transcriptome diversity is also responsible for fighting off viral infections by editing viral RNA. Genomes of both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to experience RNA editing that in turn influences viral evolution. However, the effects of altered ADAR editing patterns in the host transcriptome in coronavirus infections have not been explored. We hypothesize that changes to ADAR editing patterns, driven by differential expression of ADAR during viral infection, negatively affect protein structure and function. Changes in ADAR editing profiles can help explain underlying molecular mechanisms of the broad spectrum of symptoms seen in patients with COVID-19. Methods Here we use a publicly available RNA sequencing dataset with intestinal (Caco2), lung epithelial (Calu3) and lymph node (H1299) cell lines infected with SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 to map differential ADAR editing patterns during infection. We used our previously developed RNA-seq pipeline AIDD (Automated Isoform Diversity Detector) to explore immune gene expression profiles and map ADAR editing landscapes using machine learning, including Guttman scaling and random forest analysis. Results There is significantly higher expression of ADAR1p150 isoform in lung epithelial cell line, but not in the intestinal cell line or the lymph node cell line in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, expression of ADAR1p150 is highly correlated with identification of ADAR editing sites with high and moderate impact on protein structure and function in SARS-CoV-1 in lung epithelium, but is negatively correlated in intestinal cells. SARS-CoV-2-infected cells show similar patterns;however, the strength of the correlation is moderate. These results indicate differential ADAR editing in protein coding regions seen in SARS-CoV-1 and -2 infections may play a role in molecular mechanisms underlying clinical symptoms seen during infection. Conclusions Dynamic changes to protein structure and function like those caused by ADAR editing can help shed light on the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and may provide novel investigative avenues for therapeutic options.","Plonski, Noel-Marie Nitirahardjo Caroline Meindl Richard Piontkivska Helen",The FASEB Journal,389,4

This retrospective study performed at a tertiary teaching hospital was aimed to evaluate the effects of a physician-pharmacist joint clinic for cancer pain management. The study was performed between December 2016 and August 2019 and included 113 outpatients with moderate to severe cancer-related pain. Patients were divided into two groups according to the clinic each patient visited: the physician-pharmacist joint clinic (joint group, n=59) or physician-only clinic (usual group, n=54). Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and Morisky Medication Adherence Measure (MMAM) were used to collect data on pain intensity, interference, and medication adherence. Pain Management Index (PMI) was also calculated. BPI, MMAM, and PMI were assessed at baseline (patients' first visit, week 0) and week-4 follow-up. The Chinese version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) was used to assess patients' Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) at week 4. The primary outcomes were the improvement in pain intensity, adequacy of pain management, and medication adherence. The secondary outcome was the improvement in HRQoL. At week 4, compared to the usual group, the BPI pain intensity categories except the pain right now were significantly lower in the joint group: worst pain, 4 (3 - 7) versus 6 (4 - 8), P = 0.020; least pain, 1 (0 - 2) versus 2 (1 - 3), P = 0.010; average pain, 3 (2 - 4) versus 4 (2 - 5), P = 0.023; pain right now, 2 (1 - 3) versus 2 (0 - 4), P = 0.796. For the seven pain interference categories, there were no significant improvements in the joint group (P > 0.05). Significantly more patients achieved adequate pain control in the joint group than the usual group ((P = 0.002). There was also a significant difference in medication adherence between the two groups (P = 0.001). There were no significant differences in HRQoL between the two groups. The study suggests that pharmacist participation in outpatient cancer pain management is associated with improvement of patients' pain control and medication adherence.","Liu, Keke; Huang, Hangxing; Zhang, Lu; Huang, Yamin; Sun, Shusen; Chen, Xiaoping; Chen, Yao; Liu, Wenhui; Xiao, Jian",Basic clin. pharmacol. toxicol,389,21

Where Does COVID-19 Stand?,15.114926,5.731596,2020,"BACKGROUND: There may be a risk of COVID-19 transmission to rescuers delivering treatment for cardiac arrest. The aim of this review was to identify the potential risk of transmission associated with key interventions (chest compressions, defibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation) to inform international treatment recommendations. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review comprising three questions: (1) aerosol generation associated with key interventions; (2) risk of airborne infection transmission associated with key interventions; and (3) the effect of different personal protective equipment strategies. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization COVID-19 database on 24th March 2020. Eligibility criteria were developed individually for each question. We assessed risk of bias for individual studies, and used the GRADE process to assess evidence certainty by outcome. RESULTS: We included eleven studies: two cohort studies, one case control study, five case reports, and three manikin randomised controlled trials. We did not find any direct evidence that chest compressions or defibrillation either are or are not associated with aerosol generation or transmission of infection. Data from manikin studies indicates that donning of personal protective equipment delays treatment delivery. Studies provided only indirect evidence, with no study describing patients with COVID-19. Evidence certainty was low or very low for all outcomes. CONCLUSION: It is uncertain whether chest compressions or defibrillation cause aerosol generation or transmission of COVID-19 to rescuers. There is very limited evidence and a rapid need for further studies.

As the matter of fact, it needs unreserved effort to monitor the prevalence of the virus. However, applying an effective prediction of the prevalence is thought to be the fundamental requirement to effectively control the spreading rate. Time series models have extensively been considered as the convenient methods to predict the prevalence or spreading rate of the disease. This study, therefore, aimed to apply the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modeling approach for projecting coronavirus (COVID-19) prevalence patterns in East Africa Countries, mainly Ethiopia, Djibouti, Sudan and Somalia. The data for the study were obtained from the reports of confirmed COVID-19 cases by the official website of Johns Hopkins University from 13th March, 2020 to 30th June, 2020.The results of the study, then, showed that in the coming four month, the number of COVID-19 positive people in Ethiopia may reach up to 56,610 from 5,846 on June 30, 2020 in average-rate scenario. However, in worst case scenario forecast, the model showed that the cases will be around 84,497. The analysis further depicted that with average interventions and control scenario, cumulative number of infected persons in Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan will increase from 4,656, 2,904 and 9,258 respectively at the end of June to 8,336, 3,961 and 21,388, which is by the end of October, 2020, after four-months. But, with insufficient intervention, the number of infected persons may grow quickly and reach up to 14,072, 10,037 and 38,174 in Djibouti, Somalia and Sudan respectively. Generally, the extent of the coronavirus spreading was increased from time to time in the past four month, until 30 th June, 2020, and it is expected to continue quicker than before for the coming 4-month, until the end of October, 2020, in Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, and Sudan and more rapidly than before in Sudan and Ethiopia, while the peak will remain unknown yet. Therefore, an effective implementation of the preventive measures and a rigorous compliance by avoiding negligence with the rules such as prohibiting public gatherings, travel restrictions, personal protection measures, and social distancing may alleviate the spreading rates of the virus, particularly, Sudan and Ethiopia. Moreover, more efforts should be exerted on Ethiopian side to control the population movement across all the border areas and to strengthen border quarantining. Further, through updating more new data with continuous reconsideration of predictive model, provide useful and more precise prediction.

Methods and Results Cardiorespiratory fitness was estimated as watts per kilogram from a submaximal bicycle test in 77 169 men and women from the UK Biobank cohort and combined with World Health Organization standard body mass index categories, yielding 9 unique fitness-fatness combinations. We also formed fitness-fatness combinations based on bioimpedance as a direct measure of body composition. All-cause mortality was ascertained from death registries. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% CIs. We examined the association between fitness-fatness combinations and all-cause mortality in models with progressively more conservative approaches for accounting for reverse causation, misclassification of body composition, and confounding. Over a median follow-up of 7.7 years, 1731 participants died. In our base model, unfit men and women had higher risk of premature mortality irrespective of levels of adiposity, compared with the normal weight-fit reference. This pattern was attenuated but maintained with more conservative approaches in men, but not in women. In analysis stratified by sex and excluding individuals with prevalent major chronic disease and short follow-up and using direct measures of body composition, mortality risk was 1.78 (95% CI, 1.17-2.71) times higher in unfit-obese men but not higher in obese-fit men (0.94 [95% CI, 0.60-1.48]). In contrast, there was no increased risk in obese-unfit women (1.09 [95% CI, 0.44-1.05]) as compared with the reference. Conclusions Cardiorespiratory fitness modified the association between obesity and mortality in men, but this pattern appeared susceptible to biases in women.","Tarp, Jakob; Grøntved, Anders; Sanchez-Lastra, Miguel A; Dalene, Knut Eirik; Ding, Ding; Ekelund, Ulf",J Am Heart Assoc,389,16

But the role of immune dysregulation of malignant patients on poor prognosis of COVID-19 has remained insufficiently investigated. Here we conducted a retrospective cohort study that included 2,052 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (Cancer, n = 93; Non-cancer, n = 1,959), and compared the immunological characteristics of both cohorts. We used stratification analysis, multivariate regressions, and propensity-score matching to evaluate the effect of immunological indices. In result, COVID-19 patients with cancer had ongoing and significantly elevated inflammatory factors and cytokines (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, interleukin (IL)-2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8), as well as decreased immune cells (CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, B cells, NK cells, Th and Ts cells) than those without cancer. The mortality rate was significantly higher in cancer cohort (24.7%) than non-cancer cohort (10.8%). By stratification analysis, COVID-19 patients with immune dysregulation had poorer prognosis than those with the relatively normal immune system both in cancer and non-cancer cohort. By logistic regression, Cox regression, and propensity-score matching, we found that prior to adjustment for immunological indices, cancer history was associated with an increased mortality risk of COVID-19 (p < .05); after adjustment for immunological indices, cancer history was no longer an independent risk factor for poor prognosis of COVID-19 (p > .30). In conclusion, COVID-19 patients with cancer had more severely dysregulated immune responses than noncancerous patients, which might account for their poorer prognosis.

The aim of this study was to screen the population in Germany for negative impact on mental health in the current COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze possible risk and protective factors. METHODS: A total of 6,509 people took part in an online survey in Germany from 27 March to 6 April. The questionnaire included demographic information and ascertained psychological distress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and risk and protective factors. RESULTS: In our sample, over 50% expressed suffering from anxiety and psychological distress regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants spent several hours per day thinking about COVID-19 (M = 4.45). Psychological and social determinants showed stronger associations with anxiety regarding COVID-19 than experiences with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The current COVID-19 pandemic does cause psychological distress, anxiety, and depression for large proportions of the general population. Strategies such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle and social contacts, acceptance of anxiety and negative emotions, fostering self-efficacy, and information on where to get medical treatment if needed, seem of help, while substance abuse and suppression of anxiety and negative emotions seem to be associated with more psychological burden.","Petzold, Moritz Bruno; Bendau, Antonia; Plag, Jens; Pyrkosch, Lena; Mascarell Maricic, Lea; Betzler, Felix; Rogoll, Janina; Große, Julia; Ströhle, Andreas",Brain Behav,389,1

While sustained transmission chains of human-to-human transmission suggest high basic reproduction number R 0, variation in the number of secondary transmissions (often characterised by so-called superspreading events) may be large as some countries have observed fewer local transmissions than others. Methods: We quantified individual-level variation in COVID-19 transmission by applying a mathematical model to observed outbreak sizes in affected countries. We extracted the number of imported and local cases in the affected countries from the World Health Organization situation report and applied a branching process model where the number of secondary transmissions was assumed to follow a negative-binomial distribution. Results: Our model suggested a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission of COVID-19. Within the current consensus range of R 0 (2-3), the overdispersion parameter k of a negative-binomial distribution was estimated to be around 0.1 (median estimate 0.1; 95% CrI: 0.05-0.2 for R0 = 2.5), suggesting that 80% of secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small fraction of infectious individuals (~10%). A joint estimation yielded likely ranges for R 0 and k (95% CrIs: R 0 1.4-12; k 0.04-0.2); however, the upper bound of R 0 was not well informed by the model and data, which did not notably differ from that of the prior distribution. Conclusions: Our finding of a highly-overdispersed offspring distribution highlights a potential benefit to focusing intervention efforts on superspreading. As most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare superspreading events.","Endo, Akira; Abbott, Sam; Kucharski, Adam J; Funk, Sebastian",Wellcome Open Res,389,1

Mismanagement of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a monthly estimated use of 129 billion face masks and 65 billion gloves globally, is resulting in widespread environmental contamination. This poses a risk to public health as waste is a vector for SARS-CoV-2 virus, which survives up to 3 days on plastics, and there are also broad impacts to ecosystems and organisms. Concerns over the role of reusable plastics as vectors for SARS-CoV-2 virus contributed to the reversal of bans on single-use plastics, highly supported by the plastic industry. While not underestimating the importance of plastics in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission, it is imperative not to undermine recent progress made in the sustainable use of plastics. There is a need to assess alternatives that allow reductions of PPE and reinforce awareness on the proper public use and disposal. Finally, assessment of contamination and impacts of plastics driven by the pandemic will be required once the outbreak ends.","Prata, Joana C; Silva, Ana L P; Walker, Tony R; Duarte, Armando C; Rocha-Santos, Teresa",Environ Sci Technol,389,23

Acute respiratory failure due to widespread lung inflammation progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with an altered pulmonary and alveolar function that can lead to disability, prolong hospitalizations, and adverse outcomes. While there is no specific treatment for severe acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS due to the COVID-19 and the management is mostly supportive, it is very important to better understand the pathophysiological processes activated by the inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and metalloproteinases with the aim of their subsequent inhibition in the course of the complex treatment. Herein, we will discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms of ALI/ARDS, with a focus on the pivotal role played by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and the kinin-kallikrein system (KKS), and the effects of the possible pharmacological interventions. Aprotinin is a nonspecific protease inhibitor especially of trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasmin, and kallikrein, and it is many years in clinical use. Aprotinin inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and involved in the process of glycoprotein homeostasis. Experimental data support that the use of aprotinin to inhibit MMPs and KKS may be a new potential approach to the treatment of ALI / ARDS.","Solun, B.; Shoenfeld, Y.",Med. Drug Disc.,389,16

OBJECTIVE: With a descriptive epidemiological framing, we assessed whether recent historical patterns of regional influenza burden are reflected in the observed heterogeneity in COVID-19 cases across regions of the world. METHODS: Weekly surveillance data reported by the World Health Organization from January 2017-December 2019 for influenza and through October 31, 2020 for COVID-19 were used to assess seasonal and temporal trends for influenza and COVID-19 cases across the seven World Bank regions. RESULTS: In regions with more pronounced influenza seasonality, COVID-19 epidemics have largely followed trends similar to those seen for influenza from 2017-2019. COVID-19 epidemics in countries across Europe and Central Asia and North America, have been marked by a first peak during the spring, followed by significant reductions in COVID-19 cases in the summer months, and a second wave in the fall. In Latin America and Caribbean, COVID-19 epidemics in several countries peaked in the summer, corresponding to months with highest influenza activity in the region. Countries from regions with less pronounced influenza activity including South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, showed more heterogeneity in COVID-19 epidemics seen to date. However, similarities in COVID-19 and influenza trends were evident within select countries irrespective of region. CONCLUSIONS: Ecological consistency in COVID-19 trends seen to date with influenza trends suggest the potential for shared individual, structural, and environmental determinants of transmission. Using a descriptive epidemiological framework to assess shared regional trends for rapidly emerging respiratory pathogens with better-studied respiratory infections may provide further insights into the differential impacts of non-pharmacologic interventions and intersections with environmental conditions. Ultimately, forecasting trends and informing interventions for novel respiratory pathogens like COVID-19 should leverage epidemiologic patterns in the relative burden of past respiratory pathogens as prior information.","Baral, Stefan David; Rucinski, Katherine Blair; Twahirwa Rwema, Jean Olivier; Rao, Amrita; Prata Menezes, Neia; Diouf, Daouda; Kamarulzaman, Adeeba; Phaswana-Mafuya, Nancy; Mishra, Sharmistha",,389,16

However, adherence to social distance measures presumably requires knowledge and understanding of the current social distancing restrictions. METHODS: A modified version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour examined the role of knowledge and understanding of current social distancing measures in predicting intentions to adhere to social distancing restrictions. An online survey was administered to respondents (N = 374) in Melbourne, Australia during a period of heightened social distancing restrictions. In addition to measuring respondents' general intentions to adhere to restrictions, vignettes were used to assess intended behaviour in specific situations. RESULTS: Knowledge of social distancing restrictions predicted intentions to adhere in specific situations, but not general intentions to adhere. Knowledge of restrictions also predicted positive attitudes towards current restrictions and a greater perceived ability to adhere to the restrictions, while positive attitudes was a good predictor of both general and specific intentions to adhere. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that attitudes towards restrictions may influence whether individuals attempt to adhere to restrictions, but knowledge of the restrictions influences whether the intended behaviour actually adheres to current restrictions. SO WHAT?: These outcomes indicate that members of the public should be educated regarding the negative consequences associated with the COVID-19 virus and the capacity of social distancing to reduce transmission of the virus, and a need for social distancing restrictions to be uncomplicated and clearly communicated.","Sturman, Daniel; Auton, Jaime C; Thacker, Jemma",Health promotion journal of Australia :official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,389,1

We examined weight-related behaviors and weight management barriers among UK adults during the COVID-19 social lockdown. During April-May of the 2020 COVID-19 social lockdown, UK adults (N = 2002) completed an online survey including measures relating to physical activity, diet quality, overeating and how mental/physical health had been affected by lockdown. Participants also reported on perceived changes in weight-related behaviors and whether they had experienced barriers to weight management, compared to before the lockdown. A large number of participants reported negative changes in eating and physical activity behavior (e.g. 56% reported snacking more frequently) and experiencing barriers to weight management (e.g. problems with motivation and control around food) compared to before lockdown. These trends were particularly pronounced among participants with higher BMI. During lockdown, higher BMI was associated with lower levels of physical activity and diet quality, and a greater reported frequency of overeating. Reporting a decline in mental health because of the COVID-19 crisis was not associated with higher BMI, but was predictive of greater overeating and lower physical activity in lockdown. The COVID-19 crisis may have had a disproportionately large and negative influence on weight-related behaviors among adults with higher BMI.","Robinson, Eric; Boyland, Emma; Chisholm, Anna; Harrold, Joanne; Maloney, Niamh G; Marty, Lucile; Mead, Bethan R; Noonan, Rob; Hardman, Charlotte A",Appetite,389,1

An understanding of the factors that affect severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection will help fight the COVID-19 pandemic. This study sought to investigate the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and blood type distribution. The big data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Johns Hopkins University were used to assess the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic. The infection data in the early phase of the pandemic from six countries in each of six geographic zones divided according to the WHO were used, representing approximately 5.4 billion people around the globe. We calculated the infection growth factor, doubling times of infection and death cases, reproductive number and infection and death cases in relation to the blood type distribution. The growth factor of infection and death cases significantly and positively correlated with the proportion of the population with blood type A and negatively correlated with the proportion of the population with blood type B. Compared with the lower blood type A population (&lt;30%), the higher blood type A population (30%) showed more infection and death cases, higher growth factors and shorter case doubling times for infections and deaths and thus higher epidemic dynamics. Thus, an association exists between SARS-CoV-2 and the ABO blood group distribution, which might be useful for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liu, YueFei Haussinger L.; Steinacker, J.

The patients relieved through respiratory support, hemodynamics management, nutritional support, the application of antiviral drugs, analgesic and sedation. The treatment experience in severe cases of 2019-nCov pneumonia patients were summarized as follows: in terms of respiratory support, we needed to pay attention to the advantages of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) and the intervention of mechanical ventilation, pay attention to the ventilator parameters, and adopt prone position timely. In the aspects of fluid resuscitation and volume management, we should pay attention to the characteristics of severe patients&apos; volume status, perform early evaluation, and clinicians should focused on hemodynamic management beside the bed.

Yet score-based categorical exclusions used in critical care triage guidelines disproportionately discriminate against older adults, the cognitively and physically impaired, and the disabled. Adults over the age of 60, who make up 9.1% of the SA population, are most likely to present with disabilities and comorbidities at triage. Score-based models, drawn from international precedents, deny these patients admission to an ICU when resources are constrained, such as during influenza and COVID-19 outbreaks. The Critical Care Society of Southern Africa and the South African Medical Association adopted the Clinical Frailty Scale, which progressively withholds admission to ICUs based on age, frailty and comorbidities in a manner that potentially contravenes constitutional and equality prohibitions against unfair discrimination. The legal implications for healthcare providers are extensive, ranging from personal liability to hate speech and crimes against humanity. COVID-19 guidelines and score-based triage protocols must be revised urgently to eliminate unlawful discrimination against legally protected categories of patients in SA, including the disabled and the elderly. That will ensure legal certainty for health practitioners, and secure the full protections of the law to which the health-vulnerable and those of advanced age are constitutionally entitled.","Erasmus, N",S Afr Med J,389,24

This review will discuss the complexity of both adaptive and innate immunomes and how a flow-based assay can detect up to 158 distinct cell subsets in the periphery. This assay has been employed to show the effect of age on differences in specific immune cell subsets, and the differences in the immunome between healthy donors and age-matched cancer patients. Also reviewed are the numerous soluble factors, in addition to cytokines, that may vary in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infections and may also be employed to help define the effectiveness of a given vaccine or other antiviral agents. Various steroids have been employed in the management of autoimmune adverse events in cancer patients receiving immunotherapeutics and may be employed in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The influence of steroids on multiple immune cells subsets will also be discussed.","Donahue, Renee N; Marté, Jennifer L; Goswami, Meghali; Toney, Nicole J; Tsai, Yo-Ting; Gulley, James L; Schlom, Jeffrey",J. immunotherap. cancer,389,24

Results showed that the variations in meteorological conditions led to a national PM2.5 concentration decreased of 1.7% from 2020-01 to 2020-03, whereas it increased by 1.6% in January and decreased by 1.3% and 7.9% in February and March, respectively. The reduction of pollutants emissions led to a decrease of 14.1% in national PM2.5 concentration during the first quarter of 2020 and a decrease of 4.0%, 25.7%, and 15.0% in January, February, and March, respectively. Compared to the same period last year, the PM2.5 concentration measured in Wuhan City decreased more than in the entire country. This was caused by improved meteorological conditions and a higher reduction of pollutant emissions in Wuhan City. PM2.5 in Beijing increased annually before the epidemic outbreak and during the strict control period, mainly due to unfavorable meteorological conditions. However, the decrease in PM2.5 in Beijing compared to March 2019 was closely related to the substantial reduction of emissions. The measured PM2.5 in the ""2+26"" cities, the Fenwei Plain and the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) decreased during the first quarter of 2020, with the largest drop occurring in the Yangtze River Delta due to higher YRD emissions reductions. The meteorological conditions of ""2+26"" cities and Fenwei Plain were unfavorable before the epidemic outbreak and greatly improved during the strict control period, whereas the Yangtze River Delta had the most favorable meteorological conditions in March. The decrease in PM2.5 concentration caused by the reduction of pollutant emissions in the three key areas was highest during the strict control period.","Lu, Shi-Ze; Shi, Xu-Rong; Xue, Wen-Bo; Lei, Yu; Yan, Gang",Huan Jing Ke Xue,389,1

This contactless method is a promising technology to continuously monitor the vital signs of patients in clinical environments. In this study, we investigated both skin temperature trend measurement and the extraction of respiration-related chest movements to determine the respiratory rate using low-cost hardware in combination with advanced algorithms. In addition, the frequency of medical examinations or visits to the patients was extracted. We implemented a deep learning-based algorithm for real-time vital sign extraction from thermography images. A clinical trial was conducted to record data from patients on an intensive care unit. The YOLOv4-Tiny object detector was applied to extract image regions containing vital signs (head and chest). The infrared frames were manually labeled for evaluation. Validation was performed on a hold-out test dataset of 6 patients and revealed good detector performance (0.75 intersection over union, 0.94 mean average precision). An optical flow algorithm was used to extract the respiratory rate from the chest region. The results show a mean absolute error of 2.69 bpm. We observed a computational performance of 47 fps on an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX module for YOLOv4-Tiny, which proves real-time capability on an embedded GPU system. In conclusion, the proposed method can perform real-time vital sign extraction on a low-cost system-on-module and may thus be a useful method for future contactless vital sign measurements.","Lyra, Simon; Mayer, Leon; Ou, Liyang; Chen, David; Timms, Paddy; Tay, Andrew; Chan, Peter Y; Ganse, Bergita; Leonhardt, Steffen; Hoog Antink, Christoph",Sensors (Basel),389,30

The problem of underrepresentation in clinical research persists today. In light of the considerable COVID-19 disparities observed, this study sought to assess the race reporting and representation among COVID-19 therapeutic studies published to date. Methods: All published COVID-19 treatment-related clinical research studies with study participants in the United States were identified. For each study, the date published, treatment investigated, study design, race/ethnicity of participants, sample size and study site were recorded. For each study site, the race/ethnicity demographics of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases were identified utilizing online publicly available department of public health data. Results: Six studies (n = 3, observational; n = 3, randomized clinical trial) have been published to date with participants in the United States. A subset (n = 4) reported race/ethnicity data in the publication. Black patients were underrepresented in all studies relative to the affected population in the cities in which the studies took place. Conclusions: Given that racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 disease burden and outcomes have emerged in the United States, it is essential that all investigators uniformly report race/ethnicity data as well as attempt, in earnest, to obtain representativeness among study participants in order to ensure that we do not develop a further widening of the treatment gap during this pandemic.","Borno, Hala T; Zhang, Sylvia; Gomez, Scarlett",Contemp Clin Trials Commun,389,16

Concerns regarding morbidity, mortality and quality of life have favored the introduction of bladder sparing strategies. Trimodal therapy, combining transurethral resection, chemotherapy and radiotherapy is the current standard of care for bladder preservation strategies in selected patients with MIBC. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A comprehensive search of the Medline and Embase databases was performed. A total of 19 studies were included in a systematic review of bladder sparing strategies in MIBC management was carried out following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA). EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The overall median complete response rate after trimodal therapy (TMT) was 77% (55-93). Salvage cystectomy rate with TMT was 17% on average (8-30). For TMT, the 5-year cancer-specific survival and overall survival rates range from 42-82% and 32-74%, respectively. Currently data supporting neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy in bladder sparing approaches are emerging, but robust definitive conclusions are still lacking. Gastrointestinal toxicity rates are low around 4% (0.5-16), whereas genitourinary toxicity rates reached 8% (1-24). Quality of life outcomes are still underreported. CONCLUSIONS: Published data and clinical experience strongly support trimodal therapy as an acceptable bladder sparing strategy in terms of oncological outcomes and quality of life in selected patients with MIBC. A strong need exists for specialized centers, to increase awareness among urologists, to discuss these options with patients and to stress the increased participation of patients and their families in treatment path decision-making.","Polo-Alonso, Elvira; Kuk, Cynthia; Guruli, Georgi; Paul, Asit K; Thalmann, George; Kamat, Ashish; Solsona, Eduardo; Urdaneta, Alfredo I; Zlotta, Alexandre R; Mir, Maria C",Minerva Urol Nefrol,389,20

The total population in these counties is 132,350,027, comprising 40.3% of the U.S. population. The ratio of green spaces by land-cover type in each county was extracted from satellite imagery. A hierarchical regression analysis measured cross-sectional associations between racial disparity in infection rates and green spaces, after controlling for socioeconomic, demographic, pre-existing chronic disease, and built-up area factors. We found a higher ratio of green spaces at the county level is significantly associated with a lower racial disparity in infection rates. Four types of green space have significant negative associations with the racial disparity in SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.

Efforts to contain it have resulted in measures such as closing of borders and restrictions around travel, social activities and attending places of worship. We conducted this rapid review to systematically examine, synthesize, and critically appraise the available evidence on the relationship between pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes. The methods were compliant with the PRISMA guidelines. The review was preregistered with PROSPERO (Registration #: CRD42020181576). A literature search was conducted from January 2010 to April 2020 using ProQuest, Web of Science, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Scopus, SAGE Journals, and CINAHL. Of 3844 articles identified, we included 11 quantitative articles in the final synthesis, representing data from 32, 049 individual respondents from eight countries. We identified three pandemics (COVID-19, MERS-CoV, Influenza A(H1N1) pdm09) as well as several psychological outcomes including anxiety, mental distress, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anger. We also identified several behaviours during pandemics and categorized them into protective, preparedness, and perverse behaviours. The review showed that even though there is limited evidence regarding pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes, the current findings showed that the psychological outcomes significantly impacted on the adoption of the pandemic-related behaviours. Given the negative effects of psychological outcomes on behaviours, we recommend that mental health professionals should promote mental health support to people exhibiting psychological distress resulting from similar events in the future. Also, we recommend that future research should test the hypothesized effects of pandemics and psychological outcomes on behaviour change.","Usher, Kim; Jackson, Debra; Durkin, Joanne; Gyamfi, Naomi; Bhullar, Navjot",Int. j. ment. health nurs,389,1

It seems that prevailing over the pandemic would be achieved only by mastering over the virus pathophysiology. We tried to categorize the massive amount of available information for useful interpretation. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched databases with different keywords and search strategies that focus on virulence and pathophysiology of COVID-19. The present review has aimed to gather and categorize all implemented drugs based on the susceptible virulence mechanisms, and the pathophysiological events in the host cells, discussing and suggesting treatments. RESULTS: As a result, the COVID-19 lifecycle were categorized as following steps: ""Host Cell Attachment"" which is mainly conducted with ACE2 receptors and TMPRSS2 from the host cell and Spike (S) protein, ""Endocytosis Pathway"" which is performed mainly by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and ""Viral Replication"" which contains translation and replication of RNA viral genome. The virus pathogenicity is continued by ""Inflammatory Reactions"" which mainly caused moderate to severe COVID-19 disease. Besides, the possible effective therapeutics' mechanism and the pharmaceutical agents that had at least one experience as a preclinical or clinical study on COVID-19 were clearly defined. CONCLUSION: The treatment protocol would be occasional based on the stage of the infection and the patient situation. The cocktail of medicines, which could affect almost all mentioned stages of COVID-19 disease, might be vital for patients with severe phenomena.

Use the Capital Available in Homeopathic Practice,15.072563,5.769926,2020,"BACKGROUND: Although typical and atypical CT image findings of COVID-19 are reported in current studies, the CT image features of COVID-19 overlap with those of viral pneumonia and other respiratory diseases. Hence, it is difficult to make an exclusive diagnosis. METHODS: Thirty confirmed cases of COVID-19 and forty-three cases of other aetiology or clinically confirmed non-COVID-19 in a general hospital were included. The clinical data including age, sex, exposure history, laboratory parameters and aetiological diagnosis of all patients were collected. Seven positive signs (posterior part/lower lobe predilection, bilateral involvement, rounded GGO, subpleural bandlike GGO, crazy-paving pattern, peripheral distribution, and GGO +/- consolidation) from significant COVID-19 CT image features and four negative signs (only one lobe involvement, only central distribution, tree-in-bud sign, and bronchial wall thickening) from other non-COVID-19 pneumonia were used. The scoring analysis of CT features was compared between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19). RESULTS: Older age, symptoms of diarrhoea, exposure history related to Wuhan, and a lower white blood cell and lymphocyte count were significantly suggestive of COVID-19 rather than non-COVID-19 (p < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the combined CT image features analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the scoring system was 0.854. These cut-off values yielded a sensitivity of 56.67% and a specificity of 95.35% for a score > 4, a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 23.26% for a score > 0, and a sensitivity of 86.67% and a specificity of 67.44% for a score > 2. CONCLUSIONS: With a simple and practical scoring system based on CT imaging features, we can make a hierarchical diagnosis of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 with different management suggestions.","Luo, Lin; Luo, Zhendong; Jia, Yizhen; Zhou, Cuiping; He, Jianlong; Lyu, Jianxun; Shen, Xinping",BMC Pulm Med,389,26

Secondary objectives were to determine if there was a change in infection and complication profile with changes introduced in practice. METHODS: This UK-based multicentre retrospective national audit studied foot and ankle patients who underwent surgery between 13 January and 31 July 2020, examining time periods pre-UK national lockdown, during lockdown (23 March to 11 May 2020), and post-lockdown. All adult patients undergoing foot and ankle surgery in an operating theatre during the study period were included. A total of 43 centres in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland participated. Variables recorded included demographic data, surgical data, comorbidity data, COVID-19 and mortality rates, complications, and infection rates. RESULTS: A total of 6,644 patients were included. Of the operated patients, 0.52% (n = 35) contracted COVID-19. The overall all-cause 30-day mortality rate was 0.41%, however in patients who contracted COVID-19, the mortality rate was 25.71% (n = 9); this was significantly higher for patients undergoing diabetic foot surgery (75%, n = 3 deaths). Matching for age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, and comorbidities, the odds ratio of mortality with COVID-19 infection was 11.71 (95% confidence interval 1.55 to 88.74; p = 0.017). There were no differences in surgical complications or infection rates prior to or after lockdown, and among patients with and without COVID-19 infection. After lockdown the COVID-19 infection rate was 0.15% and no patient died of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection was rare in foot and ankle patients even at the peak of lockdown. However, there was a significant mortality rate in those who contracted COVID-19. Overall surgical complications and postoperative infection rates remained unchanged during the period of this audit. Patients and treating medical personnel should be aware of the risks to enable informed decisions.

Elective interventions and surgical procedures in most countries have been postponed and operating room resources have been diverted to manage the pandemic. The Venous and Lymphatic Triage and Acuity Scale was developed to provide an international standard to rationalise and harmonise the management of patients with venous and lymphatic disorders or vascular anomalies. Triage urgency was determined based on clinical assessment of urgency with which a patient would require medical treatment or surgical intervention. Clinical conditions were classified into six categories of: (1) venous thromboembolism (VTE), (2) chronic venous disease, (3) vascular anomalies, (4) venous trauma, (5) venous compression and (6) lymphatic disease. Triage urgency was categorised into four groups and individual conditions were allocated to each class of triage. These included (1) medical emergencies (requiring immediate attendance), example massive pulmonary embolism; (2) urgent (to be seen as soon as possible), example deep vein thrombosis; (3) semiurgent (to be attended to within 30-90 days), example highly symptomatic chronic venous disease, and (4) discretionary/nonurgent- (to be seen within 6-12 months), example chronic lymphoedema. Venous and Lymphatic Triage and Acuity Scale aims to standardise the triage of patients with venous and lymphatic disease or vascular anomalies by providing an international consensus-based classification of clinical categories and triage urgency. The scale may be used during pandemics such as the current COVID-19 crisis but may also be used as a general framework to classify urgency of the listed conditions.","Parsi, Kurosh; van Rij, Andre M; Meissner, Mark H; Davies, Alun H; De Maeseneer, Marianne; Gloviczki, Peter; Benson, Stephen; Bottini, Oscar; Manuel Canata, Victor; Dinnen, Paul; Gasparis, Antonios; Gianesini, Sergio; Huber, David; Jenkins, David; Lal, Brajesh K; Kabnick, Lowell; Lim, Adrian; Marston, William; Granados, Alberto Martinez; Morrison, Nick; Nicolaides, Andrew; Paraskevas, Peter; Patel, Malay; Roberts, Stefania; Rogan, Christopher; Schul, Marlin W; Komlos, Pedro; Stirling, Andrew; Thibault, Simon; Varghese, Roy; Welch, Harold J; Wittens, Cees H A",J Vasc Surg Venous Lymphat Disord,389,14

Some patients also experience neurological signs and symptoms ranging from anosmia, ageusia, headache, nausea, and vomiting to confusion, encephalitis, and stroke. Approximately 36% of those with severe COVID-19 experience neurological complications. The virus may enter the central nervous system through the olfactory nerve in the nasal cavity and damage neurons in the brainstem nuclei involved in the regulation of respiration. Patients with cerebellar ataxia (CA) are particularly vulnerable to severe outcome if they contract COVID-19 because of the complexity of their disease, the presence of comorbidities, and their use of immunosuppressive therapies. Most CA patients burdened by progressive neurologic deficits have substantially impaired mobility and other essential functions, for which they rely heavily on ambulatory services, including rehabilitation and psychosocial care. Cessation of these interventions because of isolation restrictions places the CA patient population at risk of further deterioration. This international panel of ataxia experts provides recommendations for neurologists caring for patients with CA, emphasizing a pro-active approach designed to maintain their autonomy and well-being: continue long-term medications, promote rehabilitation efforts, utilize the technology of virtual visits for regular contact with healthcare providers, and pay attention to emotional and psychosocial health. Neurologists should play an active role in decision-making in those CA cases requiring escalation to intensive care and resuscitation.

METHOD: We verified and applied a two-tiered testing strategy combining a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific lateral flow assay (LFA) with a nucleocapsid protein (NCP) IgG ELISA to assess seroconversion in n = 7241 individuals. The majority had experienced symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but had no access to RT-PCR testing. Longitudinal follow-up in n = 97 LFA + individuals was performed up to 20 weeks after initial infection using NCP and spike protein S1 domain (S1) IgG ELISAs and a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). RESULTS: Individuals reporting symptoms from January 2020 onwards showed seroconversion, as did a considerable proportion of asymptomatic individuals. Seroconversion for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals was higher in an area with a known infection cluster compared to a low incidence area. Overall, 94% of individuals with a positive IgG result by LFA were confirmed by NCP ELISA. The proportion of ELISA-confirmed LFA results declined over time, in line with contracting NCP IgG titres during longitudinal follow-up. Neutralizing antibody activity was considerably more stable than S1 and NCP IgG titres, and both reach a plateau after approximately 100 d. The sVNT proved to be not only highly specific, but also more sensitive than the specificity-focussed two-tiered serology approach. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the high specificity of two-tiered serology testing and highlight the sVNT used as a valuable tool to support modelling of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, complement molecular testing and provide relevant information to individuals.","Garritsen, Anja; Scholzen, Anja; van den Nieuwenhof, Daan W A; Smits, Anke P F; Datema, E Suzan; van Galen, Luc S; Kouwijzer, Milou L C E",Infect Dis (Lond),389,16

Cytokine storm is also associated with immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), a complication of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, a highly effective treatment for refractory hematological malignancies. We investigated whether COVID-19-related encephalopathy, ICANS, and other encephalopathies associated with cytokine storm, share clinical and investigative findings. METHODS: Narrative literature review. RESULTS: Comparisons between COVID-19-related encephalopathy and ICANS revealed several overlapping features. Clinically, these included dysexecutive syndrome, language disturbances, akinetic mutism and delirium. EEG showed a prevalence of frontal abnormalities. Brain MRI was often unrevealing. CSF elevated cytokine levels have been reported. A direct correlation between cytokine storm intensity and severity of neurological manifestations has been shown for both conditions. Clinical recovery occurred spontaneously or following immunotherapies in most of the patients. Similar clinical and investigative features were also reported in other encephalopathies associated with cytokine storm, such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, sepsis, and febrile infection-associated encephalopathies. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19-related encephalopathy and ICANS are characterized by a predominant electro-clinical frontal lobe dysfunction and share several features with other encephalopathies associated with cytokine storm, which may represent the common denominator of a clinical spectrum of neurological disorders. Therefore, we propose a unifying definition of cytokine storm-associated encephalopathy (CySE), and its diagnostic criteria.","Pensato, Umberto; Muccioli, Lorenzo; Cani, Ilaria; Janigro, Damir; Zinzani, Pier Luigi; Guarino, Maria; Cortelli, Pietro; Bisulli, Francesca",Ann Clin Transl Neurol,389,1

The primary outcome was the type of perineal tears, according to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) classification. RESULTS: A total of 2081 patients were included: 909 patients in the OSE cohort and 1172 patients in the SEC cohort. Couder's maneuver was performed in 59% of the SEC cohort. In the SEC cohort, there were an increase in the number of intact perinea (55% versus 63%, p < 0.001), a decrease in second-degree perineal tears (18% versus 11%, p < 0.001) and a decrease in labia minora tears (48% versus 37%, p < 0.001). The rate of obstetrical anal sphincter injuries was less than 1% in both cohorts (0.3% versus 0.5%, p = 0.7). CONCLUSION: A selective use of episiotomy combined with Couder's maneuver could reduce the incidence of perineal tears, particularly second-degree perineal tears, without increasing the rate of obstetrical anal sphincter injuries.","Forey, Pierre-Louis; Lallemant, Marine; Bourtembourg-Matras, Aude; Eckman-Lacroix, Astrid; Ramanah, Rajeev; Riethmuller, Didier; Mottet, Nicolas",Arch. gynecol. obstet,389,4

The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to emerging SARS-CoV-2 rose concern about the eventuality of IPA complicating COVID-19 in intensive care unit mechanically-ventilated patients. While the association between severe influenza and IPA has been demonstrated, it remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 infection represents a specific risk factor for IPA. A variable incidence of such complication has been previously reported, which can be partly attributed to differences in diagnostic strategy and IPA definitions, and possibly local environmental/epidemiological factors. In this article, we discuss the similarities and differences between influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) and COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). Compared to IAPA, the majority of CAPA cases have been classified as putative rather than proven/probable IPA, in the absence of positive serum galactomannan or histopathologic evidence of angio-invasion. Discrimination between Aspergillus airways colonization and CAPA is difficult. Distinct physiopathology and cytokine profiles of influenza and COVID-19 may explain these discrepancies. Whether CAPA represents a distinct entity is still debatable and many questions remain unanswered, such as its actual incidence, the predisposing role of corticosteroids or immunomodulatory drugs, and the indications for antifungal therapy.","Lamoth, Frederic; Lewis, Russell E; Walsh, Thomas J; Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P",J. infect. dis,389,26

Mosquito control programs are the first line of defense against mosquito-borne pathogens. The purpose of this study was to examine the capabilities of Florida mosquito programs to implement key mosquito measures during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. METHODS: Using a self-administered online survey, we examined the capabilities of all Florida mosquito control programs (both state-approved mosquito districts, N = 63; and open programs, N = 27) at a time when the state of Florida was still under heightened awareness of, stay-at-home orders and planning a phase 1 reopening over the COVID-19 pandemic (June to July 2020). The final sample included mosquito control programs structured as the Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) (n = 42), independent tax district (n = 16), municipal (n = 10), and health or emergency department (n = 5). We used descriptive statistics to summarize information about the characteristics of responding programs, their implemented mosquito control and surveillance activities. wWe used bivariate analysis to compare the characteristics of responding programs and the self-reported mosquito measures. RESULTS: Of the recruited mosquito control programs, 73 completed the survey (81.1% response rate; 73/90). Of these, 57.5% (n = 42) were Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) mosquito control programs, 21.9% (n = 16) were independent tax district programs, 13.7% (n = 10) were municipal mosquito control programs, and only 6.8% (n = 5) were either health or emergency department mosquito control programs. Except for arbovirus surveillance, most programs either fully or partially performed larval (61.8%) and adult (78.9%) surveillance; most programs conducted species-specific control for Aedes aegypti (85.2%, n = 54), Aedes albopictus (87.3%, n = 55), Culex quinquefasciatus (92.1%, n = 58), and Culex nigripalpus (91.9%, n = 57). CONCLUSIONS: Findings underscore the importance of ongoing mosquito control activities, and suggest that Florida mosquito control programs are vigilant and have significant capability to handle potential mosquito-borne disease threats, but arbovirus surveillance systems (laboratory testing of mosquito pools and testing of human and nonhuman specimens for arboviruses) are needed during pandemics as well.","Moise, Imelda K; Ortiz-Whittingham, Lola R; Omachonu, Vincent; Clark, Marah; Xue, Rui-De",BMC Public Health,389,27

In general, most species have developed mechanisms to minimize inbreeding such as dispersal and kin avoidance behavior. In the eusocial Hymenoptera, related individuals typically share a common nest and have relatively short mating periods, this could lead to inbreeding, and because of their single-locus complementary sex determination system, it may generate diploid males that could result in infertile triploid progeny representing a cost for the colony. Vespula germanica, is an eusocial wasp that has invaded many parts of the world, despite likely facing a reduced genetic pool during the arrival phases. We ask whether male wasp display specific aggregation behavior that favors genetic diversity, key to reduce inbreeding. Through a set of laboratory experiments, we investigated the effects of drone nestmateship and density on the aggregation behavior of V. germanica drones. We show that drones avoid aggregating with their nestmates at all densities while non-nestmates are avoided only at high densities. This suggests that lek genetic diversity and density could be regulated through drone behavior and in the long run minimize inbreeding favoring invasion success.","Masciocchi, Maité; Angeletti, Bárbara; Corley, Juan C; Martínez, Andrés S",Sci Rep,389,26

An ad hoc, validated questionnaire has 44 items investigating the following domains: knowledge of COVID-19 related to (a) epidemiology, (b) pathogenesis, (c) clinical symptoms, (d) preventive measures, and (e) attitudes. Patients data and questionnaires were collected. Despite only 8.1% thought that biologics may increase the risk of COVID-19, 18.4% and 21.4% of the patients were evaluating the possibility to discontinue or modify the dosage of the current biologic therapy, respectively. Globally, male patients (P = .001) with higher scholarity level (P = .005) displayed higher knowledge of COVID-19. Patients with lower DLQI (P = .006), longer disease duration (P = .051) and lower scholarity (P = .007) have thought to discontinue/modify autonomously their biologic therapy. At the multivariate logistic regression, only the knowledge of epidemiology and preventive measures resulted independent predictors of continuation vs discontinuation and modification vs no modification, respectively.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms1 [1]. Treatment for mildly to moderately ill patients may not require hospitalization, but some people may not be able to isolate safely at home, putting household contacts and, in turn, community members at risk of COVID-19 [2, 3]. Isolation shelters, or community isolation centers (CICs), can provide people with mild to moderate symptoms, who are not at increased risk for severe disease, with a safe space to voluntarily2 isolate until they are no longer considered infectious according to Ministry of Health guidelines [1, 2]. Such centers can reduce household transmission and reserve health facility resources for more seriously ill patients. People with increased risk for severe disease or severe symptoms should seek care at a health facility or hospital where advanced care and treatment can be provided, if beds are available. If no hospital beds are available, it is preferable for these people to be isolated in a CIC rather than staying at home. People with mild or moderate illness who have been tested and are awaiting a diagnosis should isolate at home until they know their status to avoid becoming infected from other patients at a CIC. However, in cases where safely isolating at home is not possible, people who are awaiting a diagnosis may isolate in a CIC. CICs should ensure that people with suspected COVID-19 (either awaiting test results or unable to be tested due to lack of tests) and those with confirmed cases are placed in separate areas. This document provides operational considerations for CDC Country Offices, Ministries of Health and partners about establishing and operating CICs for people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 who are remaining in the CIC voluntarily, and ensuring that people in CICs are safe and have access to adequate healthcare, food, water, sanitation, and hygiene products and services. It is intended for non-US settings. While this document is most relevant for low-resource settings, it may also be applicable to other settings. Guiding principles: Each community is unique, and CDC Country Offices, Ministries of Health, and partners may wish to consider local context, local health system capacity, and other factors which may preclude people being able to isolate safely at home. CICs may be implemented at any time, regardless of the level of community transmission, based on guidance from public health officials, and may be scaled up or down as needed. While specific considerations may vary by country and location within a country, locating CICs close to the community they are intended to serve may facilitate support from patients’ families and encourage use of these centers. Footnotes Mild illness may include: uncomplicated upper respiratory tract viral infection symptoms such as fever, fatigue, cough (with or without sputum production), anorexia, malaise, muscle pain, sore throat, new loss of smell or taste, dyspnea, nasal congestion, or headache.

OBJECTIVE: Study objectives include estimating incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in essential workers by symptom presentation and demographic factors, determining independent effects of occupational and community exposures on incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, establishing molecular and immunologic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in essential workers, describing the duration and patterns of rRT-PCR-positivity, and examining post-vaccine immunologic response. METHODS: Eligible participants include Arizona residents aged 18-85 years who work at least 20 hours per week in an occupation involving regular direct contact (within three feet) with others. Recruitment goals are stratified by demographic characteristics (50% aged 40 or older, 50% women, and 50% Hispanic or American Indian), by occupation (40% healthcare personnel, 30% first responders, and 30% other essential workers), and by prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (with up to 50% seropositive at baseline). Information on sociodemographics, health and medical history, vaccination status, exposures to individuals with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, use of personal protective equipment, and perceived risks are collected at enrollment and updated through quarterly surveys. Every week, participants complete active surveillance for COVID-19-like illness (CLI) and self-collect nasal swabs. Additional self-collected nasal swab and saliva specimens are collected in the event of CLI onset. Respiratory specimens are sent to Marshfield Laboratories and tested for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. CLI symptoms and impact on work and productivity are followed through illness resolution. Serum specimens are collected every 3 months and additional sera are collected following incident rRT-PCR positivity and after each COVID-19 vaccine dose. Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections will be calculated by person-weeks at risk and compared by occupation and demographic characteristics and by seropositivity status and infection and vaccination history. RESULTS: The AZ HEROES study was funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Enrollment began July 27, 2020 and as of May 1, 2021 a total of 3,165 participants have been enrolled in the study. CONCLUSIONS: AZ HEROES is unique in aiming to recruit a diverse sample of essential workers and prospectively following strata of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative and seropositive adults. Survey results combined with active surveillance data on exposure, CLI, weekly molecular diagnostic testing, and periodic serology will be used to estimate the incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, assess the intensity and durability of immune responses to natural infection and COVID-19 vaccination, and contribute to the evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness.

There are significant knowledge gaps in the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, investigation tools and management. In this article, we review the available evidence about this disease. Every decade has witnessed the evolution of a new coronavirus epidemic since the last three decades. The varying transmission patterns, namely, nosocomial transmission and spread through mildly symptomatic cases is an area of concern. There is a spectrum of clinical features from mild to severe life threatening disease with major complications like severe pneumonia, ARDS, acute cardiac injury and septic shock. Presence of bilateral ground glass opacity and consolidation on imaging in appropriate clinical background should raise a suspicion about COVID 19. Poor prognostic factors include Multilobular infiltration on chest imaging, Lymphopenia, Bacterial co-infection, Smoking history, Chronic medical conditions like Hypertension and age >60 years (MuLBSTA score). Diagnosis is confirmed with PCR based testing of appropriate respiratory samples. Management is primarily supportive, with newer antivirals (lopinavir ritonavir and Remdesivir) under investigation. Role of steroids is still inconclusive. Standard infection control and prevention techniques should be followed. Vigilant screening of suspected cases and their contacts is important. Isolation of symptomatic cases and home quarantine of asymptomatic contacts is recommended.

Treatment of gastric cancer (GC) patients in the pandemic era with high hospital burden and under severe oncological/surgical resource constraints should implicate a need for resource re-allocation with a new ""pandemic"" GC treatment algorithm. The neoadjuvant/perioperative (radio-)chemotherapy is applied in the majority of advanced GC cases with poor postoperative therapy compliance. In the East, radical surgery is frequently used in the first instance, with adjuvant chemotherapy reserved for patients with a high risk of recurrence. Moreover, the elderly population might be effectively treated by surgery alone, thus saving oncological resources for younger people who need a more aggressive approach. In this framework, prioritization is a key concept based on the severity of symptoms and the need for urgent (surgical) intervention. High-risk and marginally effective surgery should be replaced with definitive radio- and/or chemotherapy. The pandemic framework to provide optimal care for GC patients must be based on multidisciplinary decision-making and include all anti-cancer treatment options: surgery, systemic therapy, and radiotherapy. The priority and staffing dictate adherence to the new algorithm. We believe that these priorities may improve the delivery of care to all, including elderly GC patients.","Polkowski, Wojciech Piotr; Sedlak, Katarzyna; Rawicz-Pruszynski, Karol",Cancer Manag Res,389,20

In the case of the SkillsLab at the Dorothea Erxleben Lernzentrum Halle (Saale) at the Martin Luther University Halle (Saale)-Wittenberg, this meant in relation to the communication courses that a considerable proportion of the simulation participants of advanced age or with pre-existing conditions were suddenly no longer available for conversation simulations in teaching. Project description: In the course of the seminar ""Conversation with relatives - dealing with relatives"" in the 8th semester, the conversation simulation was therefore adapted at short notice and converted into a telephone conversation. Thus, the simulation subjects were able to participate remotely and the students had the opportunity to test their doctor-patient conversation skills with regard to telephone calls in a safe environment. Results: The focus on nonverbal techniques and the departure from the usual face-to-face setting was perceived by students and simulation subjects alike as a positive stimulus and particularly challenging. The lack of visual impressions had made empathic conversation more difficult. Discussion and Conclusions: The positive experiences from this project should be used to expand the communication curriculum in the future to include telephone-based conversations with simulation subjects. Ideally, it would then be possible for the simulation persons to be present in the future after the conversation for feedback mediation and group discussion.","Ludwig, Clemens; Stoevesandt, Dietrich; Ludwig, Christiane; Fritsche, Vivien",GMS J Med Educ,389,16

Herein, we aimed to investigate the reflections of our otherwise crowded emergency services' quietness in the period of normalization. METHODOLOGY: Our study retrospectively investigated three groups of patients: the patients who were admitted to the emergency service in the 'Period of Restrictions' when the restrictions were imposed to limit the spread of the COVID-19 infection; the patients who were admitted to the emergency service in the 'Period of Normalization' when normalization attempts were made and the restrictions were lifted; and the patients who were admitted to the emergency service in the 'Period of Pre-pandemic Normal' exactly 1 year before the normalization period, which would reflect the normal functioning of the emergency service at that time. The three groups were compared with respect to the demographic characteristics and patient outcomes (death/hospitalization/discharge). RESULTS: A total of 69,474 patients were admitted to the emergency service in the 'Period of Pre-pandemic Normal' whereas 21,278 patientswere admitted in the 'Period of Restrictions'. The number of emergency service admissions in the 'Period of Restrictions' was significantly lower (p<0.01). A total of 72,843 patients were admitted to the emergency service in the 'Period of Normalization'. There was no statistically significant difference between the 'Period of Pre-pandemic Normal' and the 'Period of Normalization' in terms of the number of emergency service admissions (p=0.127). A total of 9,421 (13.5%) patients were hospitalized in the 'Period of Pre-pandemic Normal' and the corresponding figure for the 'Period of Normalization' was 19,876 (27.2%). A total of 24 (0.03%) patients died in the 'Period of Pre-pandemic Normal' while 172 (0.23%) patients died in the 'Period of Normalization'. The number of patients who were hospitalized and lost in the 'Period of Normalization' was significantly higher than that of patients who were hospitalized and lost in the 'Period of Pre-pandemic Normal' (p<0.01) CONCLUSION: In the period of COVID-19 pandemic, fear of getting infected and the restrictions imposed to limit the spread of the disease have kept people out of hospitals. We believe that while the restrictions imposed on various activities have prevented thevirus from spreading, they also caused the course of non-COVID-19 diseases to worsen and mortality rates to rise. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the public should be informed about the importance of uninterrupted treatment/follow-up and 'Life-threatening Urgent Conditions' that should necessarily prompt hospital visit in possible pandemics.","Görmeli Kurt, Nazli; Çamci, Melih",Int J Clin Pract,389,21

Hip fractures affect elderly populations, necessitate hospital admissions, and place this group at particular risk from COVID-19 infection. This study investigates the effect of COVID-19 infection on 30-day hip fracture mortality. Method: Data related to seventy-five adult hip fractures admitted to two units during March and April 2020 was reviewed. The mean age was 83.5 years (range 65-98 years) and most (53, 70.7%) were females. The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality associated with COVID-19 infection. Results: The COVID-19 infection rate was 26.7% (20 patients), with a significant difference in the 30-day mortality rate in COVID-19 positive group (10/20, 50%) compared to COVID-19 negative group (4/55, 7.3%), with mean time to death of 19.8 days (95% confidence interval 17.0-22.5). The mean time from admission to surgery was 43.1 hours and 38.3 hours, in COVID-19 positive and COVID-19 negative groups, respectively. All COVID-19 positive patients had shown symptoms of fever and cough, and all ten cases who died were from hypoxia. Seven (35%) cases had radiological lung findings consistent with viral pneumonitis which resulted in mortality (70% of mortality). 30% (n = 6) contracted the COVID-19 infection in the community and 70% (n = 14) developed symptoms after hospital admission. Conclusion: Hip fractures associated with COVID-19 infection have a high 30-day mortality. COVID-19 testing and chest x-ray for patients presenting with hip fractures, helps in early planning of high-risk surgeries and allows counselling of the patients and family using realistic prognosis.","Fadulelmola, Ahmed; Gregory, Rob; Gordon, Gavin; Smith, Fiona; Jennings, Andrew",Trauma,389,14

We aimed to obtain nation wide data from Nepal, about hospital preparedness for COVID-19. METHODS: Online questionnaire was prepared in accordance with the Center for Disease Control recommendations to assess preparedness of hospitals for COVID-19. The questionnaire was circulated to the over 800 doctors across the nation, who are the life members of six medical societies. RESULTS: We obtained 131 completed responses from all seven provinces. Majority of respondents had anaesthesiology as the primary specialty. Only 52 (39.7%) participants mentioned that their hospital had policy to receive suspected or proven cases with COVID-19. Presence of isolation ward was mentioned by 83 (63.4%) respondents, with only 9 (6.9%)mentioning the presence of airborne isolation.

Contact with contaminated surfaces or objects is one of the major channels of spreading infectious diseases among the community. Therefore, the typical contaminable surfaces, such as walls and handrails, should often be cleaned using disinfectants. Nevertheless, safety and efficiency are the major concerns of the utilization of human labor in this process. Thereby, attention has drifted toward developing robotic solutions for the disinfection of contaminable surfaces. A robot intended for disinfecting walls should be capable of following the wall concerned, while maintaining a given distance, to be effective. The ability to operate in an unknown environment while coping with uncertainties is crucial for a wall disinfection robot intended for deployment in public spaces. Therefore, this paper contributes to the state-of-the-art by proposing a novel method of establishing the wall-following behavior for a wall disinfection robot using fuzzy logic. A non-singleton Type 1 Fuzzy Logic System (T1-FLS) and a non-singleton Interval Type 2 Fuzzy Logic System (IT2-FLS) are developed in this regard. The wall-following behavior of the two fuzzy systems was evaluated through simulations by considering heterogeneous wall arrangements. The simulation results validate the real-world applicability of the proposed FLSs for establishing the wall-following behavior for a wall disinfection robot. Furthermore, the statistical outcomes show that the IT2-FLS has significantly superior performance than the T1-FLS in this application.","Muthugala, M A Viraj J; Samarakoon, S M Bhagya P; Mohan Rayguru, Madan; Ramalingam, Balakrishnan; Elara, Mohan Rajesh",,389,1

Particularly, epitopes were mapped from conserved receptor-binding domain of spike protein which have been experimentally validated in SARS-CoV-1 as a promising target for vaccine development. RESULTS: A multi-epitopic vaccine construct comprising of B-cell, CTL, HTL epitopes was developed along with fusion of adjuvant and linkers. The epitopes identified herein are reported for the first time and were predicted to be highly antigenic, stable, nonallergen, nontoxic and displayed conservation across several SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different countries. Additionally, the epitopes associated with maximum HLA alleles and population coverage analysis shows the proposed epitopes would be a relevant representative of large proportion of the world population.

An overlapping theme titled 'value of technology in teaching communication' comprised of mutual feedback from both students and clinical facilitators. Early implementation, continued accessibility, enhancing realism and technological improvements to the VCAAI were listed as key areas for program improvement, while increased situational sensitivity and language training are recommended to further enhance students' communication skills. CONCLUSION: The mixed attitudes toward virtual patient interactions and recognitions of the benefits of virtual patient simulations suggest the potential effectiveness of the use of virtual patients in teaching effective nursing communication skills. However, the lack of authenticity and other limitations need to be addressed before official implementations of such trainings with virtual patients to undergraduate nursing curricula.","Shorey, Shefaly; Ang, Emily; Ng, Esperanza Debby; Yap, John; Lau, Lydia Siew Tiang; Chui, Chee Kong",Nurse Educ Today,389,12

To prevent COVID-19 infection, all teaching at Suzuka University of Medical Sciences from April to June 2020 took place as remote lectures, not in the face-to-face format. This study analyzed postlecture questionnaire responses regarding face-to-face and remote teaching on the subject of nuclear medicine technology examinations. We examined the educational effect of using remote lectures. Methods: We conducted a questionnaire survey among students by means of a 5-point evaluation scale about satisfaction, comprehension, concentration, preparation, reviewing, and the question environment for face-to-face and remote lectures. Results: We present the results as means and SDs. Satisfaction results for face-to-face and remote lectures were 3.30 ± 0.72 and 3.36 ± 0.88, respectively. Comprehension results for face-to-face and remote lectures were 3.30 ± 0.71 and 3.30 ± 0.83, respectively. Concentration results for face-to-face and remote lectures were 3.50 ± 0.69 and 3.05 ± 0.90, respectively. The preparation results for face-to-face and remote lectures were 2.57 ± 0.88 and 2.67 ± 0.94, respectively. The reviewing results for face-to-face and remote lectures were 2.84 ± 0.85 and 3.39 ± 0.89, respectively. The question environment results for face-to-face and remote lectures lessons were 2.94 ± 0.90 and 3.43 ± 0.84, respectively. There were no significant differences between face-to-face and remote lectures in terms of satisfaction, comprehension, or preparation. There were significant differences between face-to-face and remote lectures in terms of concentration, reviewing, and the questioning environment (P < 0.001). Conclusion: This comparative analysis of the postlecture questionnaire responses for face-to-face and remote formats in nuclear medicine technology examinations showed that remote lectures have a strong educational effect. We believe that, in future, remote lectures should be considered a tool in student education.","Nakaya, Koji; Yasuda, Eisuke; Muto, Hiroe; Matsuura, Kanae; Higashide, Ryo; Arai, Nobuyuki",J Nucl Med Technol,389,33

Recently, vitamin D deficiency was identified as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in healthy people, as it predisposes to different vascular dysfunctions that can result in plaque development and fragility. In this scenario, the fundamental aim of the study was to reproduce a disease model inducing vitamin D deficiency and atheromatosis in ApoE-/- mice and then to evaluate the impact of this vitamin D status on the onset/progression of atheromatosis, focusing on plaque formation and instability. METHODS AND RESULTS: In our murine disease model, vitamin D deficiency was achieved by 3 weeks of vitamin D deficient diet along with intraperitoneal paricalcitol injections, while atheromatosis by western-type diet administration. Under these experimental conditions, vitamin D deficient mice developed more unstable atheromatous plaques with reduced or absent fibrotic cap. Since calcium and phosphorus metabolism and also cholesterol and triglycerides systemic concentration were not affected by vitamin D level, our results highlighted the role of vitamin D deficiency in the formation/instability of atheromatous plaque and, although further studies are needed, suggested a possible intervention with vitamin D to prevent or delay the atheromatous disease. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained open the question about the potential role of the vitamins in the pharmacological treatments of cardiovascular disorders as coadjutant of the primary drugs used for these pathologies.","Rimondi, Erika; Marcuzzi, Annalisa; Casciano, Fabio; Tornese, Gianluca; Pellati, Agnese; Toffoli, Barbara; Secchiero, Paola; Melloni, Elisabetta",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,389,26

The raising mortality rate highlighted the necessity to identify the most susceptible populations, such as pregnant women and their fetuses, in order to protect them. Few studies have been conducted trying to identify maternal-neonatal outcomes among pregnant patients affected by COVID 19. In this scenario, this study aims to analyse poor maternal–neonatal outcomes in pregnant women affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. MethodsThis was a double-centre, 5 months retrospective analysis conducted in Italy. The study population consisted of pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection assessed by Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swabs.Results145 pregnant women affected by confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Among them, 116 (80%) were symptomatic and 29 (20%) were asymptomatic. Up to half of the patients (n = 111;76.5%) had a past history of respiratory disease. The mean gestational age at delivery was 36 weeks ± 5 days, while the mean maternal age was 31.5 ± 5.63. Reactive C protein (CRP) serum levels were higher than the normal range corresponding to a mean value of 56.93 ± 49.57 mg/L. The mean interval between the diagnosis of maternal COVID-19 infection and the delivery was 8.5 days. With regard to the type of delivery, the percentage of patients who delivered vaginally was higher than those who experienced a caesarean section. (74.4% vs 25.6%). The percentage of term birth was higher than preterm one (62% vs 38%). Finally, the percentages of maternal and neonatal death were found to be 5% and 6%, respectively;similarly, the percentage of the infection vertical transmission was 5%. ConclusionCOVID-19 infection in pregnant women seems to negatively affect both maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, it is important to emphasize that most of the cases of maternal death occurred in patients with severe symptoms and highly altered parameters related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the future, larger studies are warranted in order to validate these findings.","Di Guardo, Federica Di Grazia Flavia Maria Di Gregorio Luisa Maria Zambrotta Elisa Carrara Grazia Gulino Ferdinando Antonio Tuscano Attilio Palumbo Marco",Archives of Gynecology and Obstetrics,389,20

This review aimed at examining the pooled prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Systematic searches of databases were conducted for literature published on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, PsycArticle, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure until October 14, 2020. Statistical analyses were performed using R software (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42020180309). RESULTS: A total of 106,713 people exposed to the trauma resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak were identified in the 76 articles, of which 33,810 were reported with post-traumatic stress symptoms. The pooled prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak was 28.34%, with a 95% confidence interval of 23.03-34.32%. Subgroup analysis indicated that older age, male and bigger sample size were associated with higher prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms. After controlling for other factors, the results of meta-regression showed that the influence of gender and sample size on prevalence is no longer significant. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were very common among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak. Further research is needed to explore more possible risk factors for post-traumatic stress symptoms and identify effective strategies for preventing PTSD-related symptoms among people exposed to the trauma resulting from COVID-19 outbreak.","Qiu, Dan; Li, Yilu; Li, Ling; He, Jun; Ouyang, Feiyun; Xiao, Shuiyuan",Eur Psychiatry,389,24

The variability in the timing and the method of delivery, ranging from normal vaginal delivery to an emergent cesarean section, adds complexity to the role of the health care providers in the medical care of the patient and in the interactions, they have with other providers. These variations are further influenced by the availability of isolation rooms in the facility and adequacy of personal protective equipment. The protocols already set in place can be further challenged when the facility reaches its capacity to manage the patients.To fulfill the goal of providing adequate management to the SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women and their infants, avoid variation from suggested guidelines, and decrease risk of exposure of the health care workers, the health care provider team needs to review the variations regularly. While familiarity can be achieved by reviewing the guidelines, clinical case simulations provide a more hands-on approach.Using case-based simulations and current guidance from the Center for Disease Control, American Academy of Pediatrics, and recent reviews, we discuss a management guideline developed at our institution to facilitate provision of care to SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women during delivery and to their infants, while protecting health care providers from exposure, and in keeping with the local facility logistics. KEY POINTS: · Simulation of delivery of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women can minimize the risk of exposure to healthcare professionals.. · Four common scenarios of delivery as described can be adapted for the evolving guidelines for the management of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women.. · Integrating simulations of management of SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women is feasible in daily clinical routine..","Rastogi, Shantanu",Am J Perinatol,389,29

To prevent the exacerbation of health disparities, there is a need to understand the implementation of meal distribution among large urban school districts during emergencies and to what degree these strategies provide equitable meal access. Our case study of four large urban school districts during the COVID-19 pandemic aims to address these knowledge gaps. Guided by the Getting to Equity (GTE) framework, we conducted a mixed-methods study evaluating emergency meal distribution and strategy implementation in four large urban school districts (Chicago Public Schools, Houston Independent School District, Los Angeles Unified School District, and New York City Department of Education). We gathered data from school district websites on (1) meal service and delivery sites and (2) district documents, policies, communication, and resources. Using qualitative coding approaches, we identified unique and shared district strategies to address meal distribution and communications during the pandemic according to the four components of the GTE framework: increase healthy options, reduce deterrents, build on community capacity, and increase social and economic resources. We matched district census tract boundaries to demographic data from the 2018 American Community Survey and United States Department of Agriculture food desert data, and used geographic information systems (GIS) software to identify meal site locations relative to student population, areas of high poverty and high minority populations, and food deserts. We found that all districts developed strategies to optimize meal provision, which varied across case site. Strategies to increase healthy options included serving adults and other members of the general public, providing timely information on meal site locations, and promoting consumption of a balanced diet. The quantity and frequency of meals served varied, and the degree to which districts promoted high-quality nutrition was limited. Reducing deterrents related to using inclusive language and images and providing safety information on social distancing practices in multiple languages. Districts built community capacity through partnering with first responder, relief, and other community organizations. Increased social and economic resources were illustrated by providing technology assistance to families, childcare referrals for essential workers, and other wellness resources. Geospatial analysis suggests that service locations across cities varied to some degree by demographics and food environment, with potential gaps in reach. This study identifies strategies that have the potential to increase equitable access to nutrition assistance programs. Our findings can support (1) ongoing efforts to address child food insecurity during the pandemic and (2) future meal provision through programs like the Summer Food Service Program and Seamless Summer Option. Future research should further examine the rationale behind meal site placement and how site availability changed over time.","McLoughlin, Gabriella M; McCarthy, Julia A; McGuirt, Jared T; Singleton, Chelsea R; Dunn, Caroline G; Gadhoke, Preety",J. urban health,389,1

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of skin testing and basophil activation testing to PEG, polysorbate 80, BNT162b2 and AZD1222 (Astra-Zeneca) COVID-19 vaccines in patients with a history of PEG allergy. METHODS: Three known PEG allergic participants and three healthy controls were recruited, and evaluated for hypersensitivity to the BNT162b2 and AZD1222 vaccines and related compounds by skin testing and basophil activation measured by CD63 upregulation using flow cytometry. RESULTS: We found that the BNT162b2 vaccine induced positive skin tests in PEG allergic patients, whereas traditional PEG skin testing was negative in two of three patients. One patient was found to be co-sensitized to both the BNT162b2 and AZD1222 vaccines due to cross-reactive PEG and polysorbate allergy. The BNT162b2 vaccine, but not PEG alone, induced dose-dependent activation of all patients' basophils ex vivo.

Emerging evidence suggests that small-molecule metabolites derived from bacterial breakdown of a variety of dietary nutrients confer a wide array of host benefits, including amelioration of inflammation in IBDs. Yet, in many cases, the molecular pathways targeted by these molecules remain unknown. Here, we describe roles for three metabolites-indole-3-ethanol, indole-3-pyruvate, and indole-3-aldehyde-which are derived from gut bacterial metabolism of the essential amino acid tryptophan, in regulating intestinal barrier function. We determined that these metabolites protect against increased gut permeability associated with a mouse model of colitis by maintaining the integrity of the apical junctional complex and its associated actin regulatory proteins, including myosin IIA and ezrin, and that these effects are dependent on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Our studies provide a deeper understanding of how gut microbial metabolites affect host defense mechanisms and identify candidate pathways for prophylactic and therapeutic treatments for IBDs.","Scott, Samantha A; Fu, Jingjing; Chang, Pamela V",Proc.

To overcome these factors, we describe the assembly of an Arduino-based digital IR thermometer with distance correction using the MLX90614 IR thermometer and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors. Coupled with some analysis of these factors, we also found ways to programme compensation methods for the final assembled digital IR thermometer to provide more accurate readings and measurements.","Goh, Nicholas Wei-Jie; Poh, Jun-Jie; Yeo, Joshua Yi; Aw, Benjamin Jun-Jie; Lai, Szu Cheng; Cheng, Jayce Jian Wei; Tan, Christina Yuan Ling; Gan, Samuel Ken-En",Sensors (Basel),389,1

In this work, we present the results of a pilot study evaluating the use of the Tidepool telemedicine platform for providing remote diabetes health services in Colombia across multiple devices. METHOD: Individuals with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes using multiple diabetes devices were recruited to evaluate the user experience with Tidepool over three months. Two endocrinologists used the Tidepool software to maintain a weekly communication with participants reviewing the devices data remotely. Demographic, clinical, psychological and usability data were collected at several stages of the study. RESULTS: Six participants, from ten at the baseline (five MDI and five CSII), completed this pilot study. Three different diabetes devices were employed by the participants: a glucose meter (Abbot), an intermittently-scanned glucose monitor (Abbot), and an insulin pump (Medtronic). A score of 81.3 in the system usability scale revealed that overall, most participants found the system easy to use, especially the web interface. The system also compared highly favourably against the proprietary platforms. The ability to upload and share data and communicate remotely with the clinicians was raised consistently by participants. Clinicians cited the lockdown imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic as a valuable test for this platform. Inability to upload data from mobile devices was identified as one of the main limitations. CONCLUSION: Tidepool has the potential to be used as a tool to facilitate remote diabetes care in Colombia. Users, both participants and clinicians, agreed to recommend the use of platforms like Tidepool to achieve better disease management and communication with the health care team. Some improvements were identified to enhance the user experience.","León-Vargas, Fabian; Martin, Clare; Garcia-Jaramillo, Maira; Aldea, Arantza; Leal, Yenny; Herrero, Pau; Reyes, Angie; Henao, Diana; Gomez, Ana María",Comput Methods Programs Biomed,389,1

The recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has rapidly formed a global pandemic, causing hundreds of thousands of infections and huge economic loss. The WHO declares that more precise measures to track, detect and isolate infected people are among the most effective means to quickly contain the outbreak. Based on trajectory big data and the theory of mean-field, we establish an aggregated risk mean=field that contains information of all risk-spreading particles by proposing a spatio-temporal model named HiRES risk map. It has dynamic fine spatial resolution and high computation efficiency enabling fast update. We then propose an objective personal epidemic risk scoring model named HiRES-p based on HiRES risk maps, and use it to develop statistical inference based method and machine learning based method for detecting suspected epidemic-infected individuals. We conduct numerical experiments by applying the proposed methods to study the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Results show that the HiRES risk map has strong ability in capturing global trend and local variability of the epidemic risk, thus can be applied to monitor epidemic risk at country, province, city and community levels, as well as at specific high-risk locations such as at hospital and station. HiRES-p score is an effective measurement of personal epidemic risk. The detection rates as de ned by successful classification are above 90% as long as the population infection rate is under 20%, which indicates great application potential in epidemic risk prevention and control practice.","Zhou, Chuansai; Yuan, Wen; Wang, Jun; Xu, Haiyong; Jiang, Yong; Wang, Xinmin; Wen, Qiuzi Han; Zhang, Pingwen",,389,3

This offers the possibility to answer a number of highly relevant questions, regarding the evolution of the virus and the role mutations play in its spread among the population. We focus on spike proteins, as they bear the main responsibility for the effectiveness of the virus diffusion by controlling the interactions with the host cells. Using the available temporal structure of the sequencing data for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the UK, we demonstrate that every wave of the pandemic is dominated by a different variant. Consequently, the time evolution of each variant follows a temporal structure encoded in the epidemiological Renormalisation Group approach to compartmental models. Machine learning is the tool of choice to determine the variants at play, independent of (but complementary to) the virological classification. Our Machine Learning algorithm on spike protein sequencing provides a simple and unbiased way to identify, classify and track relevant virus variants without any prior knowledge of their characteristics. Hence, we propose a new tool that can help preventing and forecasting the emergence of new waves, and that can be used by decision makers to define short and long term strategies to curb the current COVID-19 pandemic or future ones.","Hoffer, Adele de; Vatani, Shahram; Cot, Corentin; Cacciapaglia, Giacomo; Conventi, Francesco; Giannini, Antonio; Hohenegger, Stefan; Sannino, Francesco",,389,16

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: ECMO has been utilized in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and refractory hypoxemia. Early case series with the use of ECMO in these patients reported high mortality exceeding 90%. METHODS: Using ICD-10 codes, data of patients with COVID-19 with ARDS, managed with ECMO between April - September 2020 were analyzed using the Vizient clinical database. Outcomes measured included in-hospital mortality, hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS) and direct cost. For comparative purposes, the outcome of a subset of COVID-19 patients aged between 18-64âyears and managed with vs. without ECMO were examined. RESULTS: 1,1182 patients with COVID-19 and ARDS received ECMO. In-hospital mortality was 45.9%, mean LOS was 36.8â±â24.9âdays and mean ICU stay was 29.1â±â17.3âdays. In-hospital mortality, according to age group was 25.2% for 1-30âyears; 42.2% for 31-50âyears; 53.2% for 51-64âyears; and 73.7% for &#8805;65âyears.

It mostly affects the elderly and those with chronic illness but can also be fatal in younger age groups. This article is the first comprehensive analysis of the epidemiological and clinical outcomes of the travel-associated SARS-CoV-2 cases until April 19, 2020. Methods: Demographic and clinical data of travel-associated SARS-CoV-2 cases were collected for the period between January 16, 2020 and April 19, 2020. More than one hundred and eighty databases were searched, including the World Health Organization (WHO) database, countries' ministries websites, and official media sites. Demographic and clinical data were extracted and analyzed. Results: A total of 1,186 cases from 144 countries meeting the inclusion criteria were reported and included in the analysis. The mean age of the cases was 44 years, with a male to female ratio of 1.6:1. Travel-associated cases originated from more than 40 countries, with China, Italy, and Iran reporting the highest numbers at 208, 225, and 155, respectively. Clinical symptoms varied between patients, with some reporting symptoms during the flights (117 cases; 9.87%). A total of 312 (26.31%) cases were hospitalized, of which 50 cases (4.22%) were fatal. Conclusion: Major gaps exist in the epidemiology and clinical spectrum of the COVID-19 travel-associated cases due to a lack of reporting and sharing data of many counties. The identification and implementation of methodologies for measuring traveler's risk to coronavirus would help in minimizing the spread of the virus, especially in the next waves.","Marei, Reham M; Emara, Mohamed M; Elsaied, Omar M; Nasrallah, Gheyath K; Chivese, Tawanda; Al-Romaihi, Hamad E; Althani, Mohamed H; Al Thani, Asmaa A; Farag, Elmoubasher A; Yassine, Hadi M",Front Public Health,389,1

OBJECTIVES: to investigate sociodemographic and disease-related factors that can influence self-perceived knowledge (poor/medium vs high) about COVID-19 in women of the Italian NINFEA birth cohort. DESIGN: cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: a web-based anonymous survey on COVID-19 was sent in April 2020 to women participating in the NINFEA cohort. A total of 3,129 women were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: using multiple weighted logistic regression models, self-perceived knowledge level was analysed in relation with the following variables: age, education level, family size, cumulative incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases until 7 April 2020 by province, presence of COVID-19-like symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 testing, and COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: the prevalence of self-perceived poor/medium knowledge was 57%. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, the odds ratio (OR) of self-perceived poor/medium COVID-19 knowledge level was increased for low/medium compared with high education level (OR 1.57; 95%CI 1.34-1.84), and decreased for SARS-CoV-2 testing (OR 0.25; 95%CI 0.16-0.39) and COVID-19 diagnosis (OR 0.20; 95%CI 0.07-0.60).

Although the prevalence of silent hypoxia in COVID-19 patients has been evident in several cases, the underlying pathomechanism behind this condition is still unclear. Silent hypoxia in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients can be diagnosed with the help of a pulse oximeter, blood gas levels, and a 6-min walking test.

Pentoxifylline is an immunomodulator with anti-inflammatory properties. It is a nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor and through Adenosine A2A Receptor-mediated pathways reduces tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1, interleukin 6, and interferon gamma and may act to reduce tissue damage during the cytokine storm host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This agent has been used clinically for many years and has a favorable profile of safety and tolerability. Pre-clinical data support pentoxifylline as effective in cytokine-driven lung damage. Clinical studies of pentoxifylline in radiation and cytokine-induced lung damage in humans are positive and consistent with anti-inflammatory efficacy. Pentoxifylline is a readily available, off-patent and inexpensive drug, suitable for large-scale use including in resource-limited countries. Current trials of therapeutics are largely focused on the inhibition of viral processes. We advocate urgent randomized trials of pentoxifylline for COVID-19 as a complementary approach to target the host responses.","Hendry, Bruce M; Stafford, Nina; Arnold, Ahran D; Sangwaiya, Arvind; Manglam, Vijay; Rosen, Stuart D; Arnold, Jayantha",Pharmacol Res Perspect,389,24

In Romania, specific challenges were faced with regards to managing the spread and limiting the impact of the disease, ranging from healthcare infrastructure to demographic and sociocultural aspects. As the country has a sizeable diaspora, major difficulties were faced when large numbers of individuals from highly affected areas returned to Romania. However, the fast implementation of control measures successfully averted a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases. This delayed the overburdening of an already challenged healthcare system during the initial phases of the epidemic. Furthermore, early control was facilitated by the exploitation of communication channels that penetrated all layers of society, from ordinary citizens to governmental authorities and high-ranking religious figures. The management of the COVID-19 crisis in Romania illustrates the importance of a fast initial response which takes into account the role played by sociocultural aspects in the context of an epidemic.

OBJECTIVE: This study explored how overall rates of presentations to the emergency department were impacted immediately after the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and specifically how key presenting symptoms representing emergency, standard and low-acuity conditions were impacted. METHODS: A sequential modified Delphi survey and cross-sectional analysis of administrative census data from a tertiary care center in New Brunswick, Canada, were performed. Details of ED presentations for emergency, standard and low-acuity conditions from February 1 to April 30, 2020, were compared to data from previous years. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in the number of patients visiting the ED with emergency, standard and low-acuity complaints immediately after March 13, 2020, compared to 2019. The proportion of females and males remained similar, with a median age of 48 years in 2020 and 44 years in 2019. Total presentation patterns to the ED (registrations, admissions to hospital and left without being seen numbers) decreased, compared to previous years. CONCLUSIONS: We report a predictable decrease in patient visits to the ED with minor, non-life-threatening conditions during a pandemic. However, we also report a decrease in presentations for emergency and standard conditions. Improved messaging highlighting the need to seek help for ""true"" emergencies, while providing non-ED options for minor, non-life-threatening conditions, may be helpful under normal circumstances and during future pandemics.","Cole, Valancy; Atkinson, Paul; Hanlon, Robert; Dutton, Daniel J; Liu, Tong; Fraser, Jacqueline; Lewis, David; Brunt, Keith R; Wiemer, Hana; Dahn, Tara; Fok, Patrick T; Vaillancourt, Chris",CJEM,389,16

To meet the exponential demand in testing, there has been an accelerated development of both molecular and serological assays across a plethora of platforms. The present review discusses the current literature on these modalities, including nucleic acid amplification tests, direct viral antigen tests and the rapidly expanding laboratory-based and point of care serological tests. This suite of complementary tests will inform crucial decisions by healthcare providers and policy makers, and understanding their strengths and limitations will be critical to their judicious application for the development of algorithmic approaches to treatment and public health strategies.","La Marca, Antonio; Capuzzo, Martina; Paglia, Tiziana; Roli, Laura; Trenti, Tommaso; Nelson, Scott M",Reprod Biomed Online,389,16

Adrecizumab (HAM8101) is a first-in-class humanized monoclonal anti-Adrenomedullin (anti-ADM) antibody, targeting the sepsis- and inflammation-based vascular and capillary leakage. Within a ""treatment on a named-patient basis"" approach, Adrecizumab was administered to eight extreme-critically ill COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patients received a single dose of Adrecizumab, which was administered between 1 and 3 days after the initiation of mechanical ventilation. The SOFA (median 12.5) and SAPS-II (median 39) scores clearly documented the population at highest risk. Moreover, six of the patients suffered from acute renal failure, of whom five needed renal replacement therapy. The length of follow-up ranged between 13 and 27 days. Following the Adrecizumab administration, one patient in the low-dose group died at day 4 due to fulminant pulmonary embolism, while four were in stable condition, and three were discharged from the intensive care unit (ICU). Within 12 days, the SOFA score, as well as the disease severity score (range 0-16, mirroring critical resources in the ICU, with higher scores indicating more severe illness), decreased in five out of the seven surviving patients (in all high-dose patients). The PaO2/FiO2 increased within 12 days, while the inflammatory parameters C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and interleukin-6 decreased. Importantly, the mortality was lower than expected and calculated by the SOFA score. In conclusion, in this preliminary uncontrolled case series of eight shock patients with life-threatening COVID-19 and ARDS, the administration of Adrecizumab was followed by a favorable outcome. Although the non-controlled design and the small sample size preclude any definitive statement about the potential efficacy of Adrecizumab in critically ill COVID-19 patients, the results of this case series are encouraging.","Karakas, Mahir; Jarczak, Dominik; Becker, Martin; Roedl, Kevin; Addo, Marylyn M; Hein, Frauke; Bergmann, Andreas; Zimmermann, Jens; Simon, Tim-Philipp; Marx, Gernot; Lütgehetmann, Marc; Nierhaus, Axel; Kluge, Stefan",Biomolecules,389,7

As of now, approximately 0.15 million people around the globe are infected with the novel coronavirus. In the last decade, two strains of the coronavirus family, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV also resulted in epidemics in south Asian and the Middle Eastern countries with high mortality rate. This scenario demands the development of a putative vaccine which may provide immunity against all current and new evolving coronavirus strains. In this study, we design an epitope-based vaccine using an immunoinformatic approach. This vaccine may protect against all coronavirus strains. The vaccine is developed by considering the geographical distribution of coronavirus strains and host genetics (Chinese population). Nine experimentally validated epitopes sequences from coronavirus strains were used to derive the variants considering the conservancy in all strains. Further, the binding affinities of all derived variants were checked with most abundant HLA alleles in the Chinese population. Three MHC class-I epitopes from Spike glycoprotein and Nucleoprotein showed sufficient binding while one MHC class-II epitope from Spike glycoprotein found to be an effective binder. A cocktail of these epitopes gave more than 95% population coverage in the Chinese population. Moreover, MD simulation also supported the above-mentioned predictions. Further, in vivo studies are needed to confirm the immunogenic potential of these vaccines. This article is protected by copyright.

Distance mentorship models may be utilized to overcome geographic limitations, increase mentorship access, and strengthen mentoring relationships in surgery. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to identify the scope of literature on distance mentoring in surgery, the range of its application, its effectiveness, and any gaps in the literature that should be addressed in order to enhance mentorship in the surgical field. DESIGN: A comprehensive PubMed review was performed in January 2021 on distance mentorship of students, trainees, and surgeons in the surgical field. Reviews, replies, and non-English articles were excluded. Data was extracted regarding publication year, author's country, specialty, subjects, aim of mentorship model, and efficacy. RESULTS: 134 total studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most studies were published in 2020, written by authors in the United States, from general surgery, and featured an expert surgeon paired with a more junior fully trained surgeon. In all, 93.3% of studies utilized distance mentorship to enhance surgical skill through telementoring and only 4.5% were focused on mentorship to enhance careers through professional development. The remaining studies utilized distance mentorship models to increase surgical research (0.7%) and clinical knowledge (1.5%). CONCLUSION: The results of this review suggest successful implementation of distance mentoring in surgery through telementoring, but a lack of professionally aimed distance mentorship programs. Amidst COVID-19, distance mentorship is particularly important because of decreased face-to-face opportunity.

A major driver leading to the lack of emphasis on timely ICU nutrition delivery is lack of objective data to guide nutrition care. If we are to ultimately overcome current fundamental challenges to effective ICU nutrition delivery, we must all adopt routine objective, longitudinal measurement of energy targets via indirect calorimetry (IC). Key evidence supporting the routine use of IC in the ICU includes (1) universal societal ICU nutrition guidelines recommending IC to determine energy requirements; (2) data showing predictive equations or body weight calculations that are consistently inaccurate and correlate poorly with measured energy expenditure, ultimately leading to routine overfeeding and underfeeding, which are both associated with poor ICU outcomes; (3) recent development and worldwide availability of a new validated, accurate, easy-to-use IC device; and (4) recent data in ICU patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) showing progressive hypermetabolism throughout ICU stay, emphasizing the inaccuracy of predictive equations and marked day-to-day variability in nutrition needs. Thus, given the availability of a new validated IC device, these findings emphasize that routine longitudinal IC measures should be considered the new standard of care for ICU and post-ICU nutrition delivery. As we would not deliver vasopressors without accurate blood pressure measurements, the ICU community is only likely to embrace an increased focus on the importance of early nutrition delivery when we can consistently provide objective IC measures to ensure personalized nutrition care delivers the right nutrition dose, in the right patient, at the right time to optimize clinical outcomes.","Wischmeyer, Paul E; Molinger, Jeroen; Haines, Krista",Nutr Clin Pract,389,2

The Korean government aimed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 through stay-at-home strategies and maintaining social distance, which are likely to result in major changes in the lifestyle, mental health, and quality of life of citizens. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on these factors in Koreans over 20 years old. METHODS: The study sample consisted of 104 adults in South Korea aged over 20 years. An online survey was conducted between August and October 2020, in which participants were asked to complete the Yonsei Lifestyle Profile to assess lifestyle changes, the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale abbreviated version. To investigate the changes in people's lifestyles, depression, and quality of life post COVID-19, descriptive statistics were calculated for these indicators before and after the onset of the pandemic. The p-value was two-sided, and values <0.05, were regarded as statistically significant. RESULTS: There was a significant decline in physical and other meaningful activities, including activities of daily living, leisure, social activity, and education. However, there were no significant changes in nutrition, except in the consumption of carbohydrates and minerals. Participants reported that their quality of life and mental health had decreased after the pandemic struck. CONCLUSIONS: We obtained novel data on the changes in the lifestyle, mental health, and quality of life of South Korean adults before and after the onset of the pandemic. The results of our study may assist health policymakers and practitioners in the development of health education or relevant interventions to deal with the pandemic situation as well as future crises.","Park, Kang-Hyun; Kim, Ah-Ram; Yang, Min-Ah; Lim, Seung-Ju; Park, Ji-Hyuk",PLoS One,389,16

Current evidence suggests a likely spillover into humans from an animal reservoir. Understanding the host range and identifying animal species that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection may help to elucidate the origin of the virus and the mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission to humans. Here we demonstrated that white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), an animal species in which the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - the SARS-CoV-2 receptor - shares a high degree of similarity to humans, are highly susceptible to infection. Intranasal inoculation of deer fawns with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in established subclinical viral infection and shedding of infectious virus in nasal secretions. Notably, infected animals transmitted the virus to non-inoculated contact deer. Viral RNA was detected in multiple tissues 21 days post-inoculation (pi). All inoculated and indirect contact animals seroconverted and developed neutralizing antibodies as early as day 7 pi. The work provides important insights into the animal host range of SARS-CoV-2 and identifies white-tailed deer as a susceptible wild animal species to the virus.IMPORTANCEGiven the presumed zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2, the human-animal-environment interface of COVID-19 pandemic is an area of great scientific and public- and animal-health interest. Identification of animal species that are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 may help to elucidate the potential origin of the virus, identify potential reservoirs or intermediate hosts, and define the mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission to humans. Additionally, it may also provide information and help to prevent potential reverse zoonosis that could lead to the establishment of a new wildlife hosts. Our data show that upon intranasal inoculation, white-tailed deer became subclinically infected and shed infectious SARS-CoV-2 in nasal secretions and feces. Importantly, indirect contact animals were infected and shed infectious virus, indicating efficient SARS-CoV-2 transmission from inoculated animals. These findings support the inclusion of wild cervid species in investigations conducted to assess potential reservoirs or sources of SARS-CoV-2 of infection.","Palmer, Mitchell V; Martins, Mathias; Falkenberg, Shollie; Buckley, Alexandra; Caserta, Leonardo C; Mitchell, Patrick K; Cassmann, Eric D; Rollins, Alicia; Zylich, Nancy C; Renshaw, Randall W; Guarino, Cassandra; Wagner, Bettina; Lager, Kelly; Diel, Diego G",J. virol,389,16

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successful in making predictions, especially in image classification. However, these famous deep learning models use tens of millions of parameters based on a large number of pre-trained filters which have been repurposed from previous data sets. We propose a novel Interaction-based Convolutional Neural Network (ICNN) that does not make assumptions about the relevance of local information. Instead, we use a model-free Influence Score (I-score) to directly extract the influential information from images to form important variable modules. We demonstrate that the proposed method produces state-of-the-art prediction performance of 99.8% on a real-world data set classifying COVID-19 Chest X-ray images without sacrificing the explanatory power of the model. This proposed design can efficiently screen COVID-19 patients before human diagnosis, and will be the benchmark for addressing future XAI problems in large-scale data sets.","Lo, Shaw-Hwa; Yin, Yiqiao",,389,18

We aimed to determine whether clinical phenotypes of patients with COVID-19 can be derived from clinical data, to assess the reproducibility of these phenotypes and correlation with prognosis, and to derive and validate a simplified probabilistic model for phenotype assignment. Phenotype identification was not primarily intended as a predictive tool for mortality. METHODS: In this study, we used data from two cohorts: the COVID-19@Spain cohort, a retrospective cohort including 4035 consecutive adult patients admitted to 127 hospitals in Spain with COVID-19 between Feb 2 and March 17, 2020, and the COVID-19@HULP cohort, including 2226 consecutive adult patients admitted to a teaching hospital in Madrid between Feb 25 and April 19, 2020. The COVID-19@Spain cohort was divided into a derivation cohort, comprising 2667 randomly selected patients, and an internal validation cohort, comprising the remaining 1368 patients. The COVID-19@HULP cohort was used as an external validation cohort. A probabilistic model for phenotype assignment was derived in the derivation cohort using multinomial logistic regression and validated in the internal validation cohort. The model was also applied to the external validation cohort. 30-day mortality and other prognostic variables were assessed in the derived phenotypes and in the phenotypes assigned by the probabilistic model. FINDINGS: Three distinct phenotypes were derived in the derivation cohort (n=2667)-phenotype A (516 [19%] patients), phenotype B (1955 [73%]) and phenotype C (196 [7%])-and reproduced in the internal validation cohort (n=1368)-phenotype A (233 [17%] patients), phenotype B (1019 [74%]), and phenotype C (116 [8%]). Patients with phenotype A were younger, were less frequently male, had mild viral symptoms, and had normal inflammatory parameters. Patients with phenotype B included more patients with obesity, lymphocytopenia, and moderately elevated inflammatory parameters. Patients with phenotype C included older patients with more comorbidities and even higher inflammatory parameters than phenotype B. We developed a simplified probabilistic model (validated in the internal validation cohort) for phenotype assignment, including 16 variables. In the derivation cohort, 30-day mortality rates were 2·5% (95% CI 1·4-4·3) for patients with phenotype A, 30·5% (28·5-32·6) for patients with phenotype B, and 60·7% (53·7-67·2) for patients with phenotype C (log-rank test p<0·0001). The predicted phenotypes in the internal validation cohort and external validation cohort showed similar mortality rates to the assigned phenotypes (internal validation cohort: 5·3% [95% CI 3·4-8·1] for phenotype A, 31·3% [28·5-34·2] for phenotype B, and 59·5% [48·8-69·3] for phenotype C; external validation cohort: 3·7% [2·0-6·4] for phenotype A, 23·7% [21·8-25·7] for phenotype B, and 51·4% [41·9-60·7] for phenotype C). INTERPRETATION: Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 can be classified into three phenotypes that correlate with mortality. We developed and validated a simplified tool for the probabilistic assignment of patients into phenotypes. These results might help to better classify patients for clinical management, but the pathophysiological mechanisms of the phenotypes must be investigated.

There are more limited data for systemic thromboembolism. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of systemic and venous thromboembolism as well as major bleeding and mortality in relation to underlying risk factors and the impact of anticoagulation use in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 admitted to Union Hospital, Wuhan, Hubei, China between January 08, 2020 and April 7, 2020 were enrolled in this retrospective study. Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to determine associated risk factors for clinical events, adjusting for the severity of COVID-19 infection, drug therapies, comorbidities, surgery, and use of antithrombotic drugs. There were 1125 patients (49.9% male; mean age 58 years (standard deviation, SD, 15 years)) with a mean follow-up of 21 (SD 13) days. Approximately 25 (30%) patients with thromboembolism also suffered bleeding events. Age was an independent risk factor for thromboembolism, bleeding events, and death (all p<0.05). After adjusting for the severity of COVID-19 infection, comorbidities, surgery, antiviral drugs, immunomodulators, Chinese herbs, and antithrombotic drugs, low lymphocyte counts (hazard ratio, HR, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03, 1.01-1.05, p=0.01) and surgery (HR 2.80, 1.08-7.29, p=0.03) independently predicted the risk for major bleeding, whereas liver dysfunction (HR 4.13, 1.30-13.1, p=0.02) was an independent risk factor for patients with both thromboembolism and bleeding events. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 were at high risk for thromboembolic and bleeding events as well as mortality. The use of anticoagulants, especially parenteral anticoagulants, significantly reduced the risk for composite outcomes of thromboembolism, bleeding events, and death. The presence of AF was a contributor to systemic thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients.","Li, Wencheng; Xu, Zhifeng; Xiang, Huiling; Zhang, Chun; Guo, Yutao; Xiong, Jing",Aging (Albany NY),389,23

For those infected thus far, there is a prevailing perspective that devising recognition for protective immunity will progressively allow segments of society to return to some functionality more than is existing. At this time, the best correlates with protection from natural coronavirus infections are systemic neutralizing antibody and mucosal IgA. Serum neutralizing antibody more easily fulfills the latter requisite, but current live virus methods for neutralization prevent large-scale application. It is conceivable that the exposure of previously infected individuals can allow for the definition of protective thresholds of neutralizing antibody. Thereafter, many other antibody assays will be able to screen for surrogate protection after correlations with protective neutralizing antibody are made. Specificity of common antibody tests would benefit from confirmatory blocking systems or confirmatory immunoblotting fingerprints with well-defined antigen(s). The opportunity for the scientific community to make these assessments is evident in the current context of the COVID-19 epidemic given the large numbers of infected individuals worldwide.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used at total of 262 serum samples (197 pre-pandemic and 65 convalescent COVID-19), and three criteria to evaluate the rapid tests under standardized and optimal conditions: (i) Immunoglobulin G (IgG) specificity ""good"" if lower limit of the 95% confidence interval was &#8805; 97.0%, ""acceptable"" if point estimate was &#8805; 97.0%, otherwise ""not acceptable"". (ii) IgG sensitivity ""good"" if point estimate was &#8805; 90.0%, ""acceptable"" if &#8805; 85.0%, otherwise ""not acceptable"". (iii) User-friendliness ""not acceptable"" if complicated to perform or difficult to read result, otherwise ""good"". We also included partial evaluations of three automated immunoassay systems. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity varied considerably; IgG specificity between 90.9% (85.9-94.2) and 100% (97.7-100.0), and IgG sensitivity between 53.8% (41.9-65.4) and 98.5% (91.0-100.0). Combining our evaluation criteria, none of the 28 rapid tests that detected IgG had an overall performance considered ""good"", seven tests were considered ""acceptable"", while 21 tests were considered ""not acceptable"". Four tests detected only total antibodies and were not given an overall evaluation. IgG sensitivity and/or specificity of the automated immunoassays did not exceed that of many rapid tests. CONCLUSION: When prevalence is low, the most important analytical property is a test's IgG specificity, which must be high to minimize false positive results.

COVID-19 bilateral pneumonia patients underwent retinal imaging 14 days after hospital discharge with structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) measurements. Vessel density (VD) and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area were evaluated in the superficial, deep capillary plexus (SCP, DCP), and choriocapillaris (CC). After exclusion criteria, only one eye per patient was selected, and 50 eyes (25 patients and 25 controls) were included in the analysis. COVID-19 patients presented significantly thinner ganglion cell layer (GCL) (p = 0.003) and thicker retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) compared to controls (p = 0.048), and this RNFL thickening was greater in COVID-19 cases with cotton wool spots (CWS), when compared with patients without CWS (p = 0.032). In both SCP and DCP, COVID-19 patients presented lower VD in the foveal region (p < 0.001) and a greater FAZ area than controls (p = 0.007). These findings suggest that thrombotic and inflammatory phenomena could be happening in the retina of COVID-19 patients. Further research is warranted to analyze the longitudinal evolution of these changes over time as well as their correlation with disease severity.","González-Zamora, Jorge; Bilbao-Malavé, Valentina; Gándara, Elsa; Casablanca-Piñera, Anna; Boquera-Ventosa, Claudia; Landecho, Manuel F; Zarranz-Ventura, Javier; García-Layana, Alfredo",,389,1
438918,438918,438918,The COVID-19 Pandemic from an Ophthalmologist's Perspective,15.053832,6.033208,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a threat to ongoing clinical trials necessitating regular face-to-face, in-person meetings, particularly in participants with a high risk of complications. Guidance on how to handle and safely continue such trials is lacking. Chronically ill elderly individuals require-in addition to protection from infection-regular physical exercise and social contact to remain healthy. Solutions on how to handle these conflicting necessities are needed. The ENTAIER-randomised controlled trial was investigating the influence of mindful movements on fall risk, fear of falling, mobility, balance, life quality, and other outcomes. The study population was planned to comprise of 550 chronically ill elderly individuals with a high risk of falling. The movements were regularly performed in coached groups over 6 months. After the trial began, COVID-19 lockdowns stopped all in-person meetings, and it was expected that the limitations of this pandemic would continue for a long term. Therefore, the exercise programme, which involved complex movements and was typically conducted face-to-face in groups, had to be substituted by a telemedicine programme within a short timeframe. The objectives, therefore, were to identify challenges and tasks that could to be resolved and steps that could to be taken to achieve high-quality, efficacy, safety, and enable human encounter and motivation. METHODS: We proceeded with four steps: 1) A literature review on the quality and feasibility issues of telemedicine in general, and specifically, in exercise training in elderly individuals. 2) Participation in two international telemedicine task forces on integrative medicine, particularly, mind-body medicine. 3) Interviews with study therapists, (for practical purposes, eurythmy therapists and Tai Chi teachers are summarized here as therapists) personnel, and international experts on providing mindful movement exercises and other physiotherapies via live telecommunication technology, and with scientists and patient representatives. 4) Final evaluation by the core trial team and subsequent planning and implementation of changes in the trial organisation. RESULTS: Various tasks and challenges were identified: for the technical equipment for therapists and patients; for the ability of therapists and trial participants to adequately manage the technology and telemedicine intervention; the reservations and concerns about the technology among therapists and participants; safety and data protection in using the technology; and study design. The two major options found on how to continue the trial in the COVID-19 situation were a complete switch to telemedicine and a partial switch in the form of risk management implemented into the former design. CONCLUSIONS: The management of an ongoing clinical trial in a national or international crisis with a minimum of available time and extra financial resources, alongside with two checklists on steps and procedures for trial continuation and telemedicine implementation, may be informative for other researchers or healthcare providers faced with similar challenges and making similar decisions in the current situation or similar future scenarios.

This disease spread to 215 countries affecting a wide range of people.

This pandemic compelled countries to enforce a socio-economic lockdown to prevent its widespread. This paper focuses on how the particulate matter pollution was reduced during the lockdown period (23 March to April 15, 2020) as compared to before lockdown. Both ground-based and satellite observations were used to identify the improvement in air quality of Pakistan with primary focus on four major cities of Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Peshawar. Both datasets have shown a substantial reduction in PM2.5 pollution levels (ranging from 13% to 33% in case of satellite observations, while 23%-58% in ground-based observations) across Pakistan. Result shows a higher rate of COVID-19 spread in major cities of Pakistan with poor air quality conditions. Yet more research is needed in order to establish linkage between COVID-19 spread and air pollution.

We assess vaccine safety, immunogenicity and efficacy in several animal models. Vaccine candidate YF-S0 has an outstanding safety profile and induces high levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in hamsters, mice and cynomolgus macaques and concomitantly a protective immunity against YFV. Humoral immunity is complemented by a favourable Th1 cell-mediated immune response as profiled in mice. In a stringent hamster model2 as well as in non-human primates, YF-S0 prevents infection with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, in hamsters, a single dose confers protection from lung disease in most vaccinated animals within 10 days. Taken together, the quality of immune responses triggered and the rapid kinetics by which protective immunity can be mounted already after a single dose warrant further development this potent SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate.","Sanchez-Felipe, Lorena; Vercruysse, Thomas; Sharma, Sapna; Ma, Ji; Lemmens, Viktor; Van Looveren, Dominique; Javarappa, Mahadesh Prasad Arkalagud; Boudewijns, Robbert; Malengier-Devlies, Bert; Liesenborghs, Laurens; Kaptein, Suzanne J F; De Keyzer, Carolien; Bervoets, Lindsey; Debaveye, Sarah; Rasulova, Madina; Seldeslachts, Laura; Li, Li-Hsin; Jansen, Sander; Yakass, Michael Bright; Verstrepen, Babs E; Böszörményi, Kinga P; Kiemenyi-Kayere, Gwendoline; van Driel, Nikki; Quaye, Osbourne; Zhang, Xin; Ter Horst, Sebastiaan; Mishra, Niraj; Deboutte, Ward; Matthijnssens, Jelle; Coelmont, Lotte; Vandermeulen, Corinne; Heylen, Elisabeth; Vergote, Valentijn; Schols, Dominique; Wang, Zhongde; Bogers, Willy; Kuiken, Thijs; Verschoor, Ernst; Cawthorne, Christopher; Van Laere, Koen; Opdenakker, Ghislain; Velde, Greetje Vande; Weynand, Birgit; Teuwen, Dirk E; Matthys, Patrick; Neyts, Johan; Jan Thibaut, Hendrik; Dallmeier, Kai",Nature (Lond.),389,23

Hypoxia-induced inflammatory signaling may lead to retinal inflammation, gliosis and visual disturbances. We investigated the consequences of systemic hypoxia using serial retinal optical coherence tomography and by assessing the earliest changes within 24h after hypoxia by measuring a proteomics panel of 39 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors in the plasma and retina, as well as using retinal histology. We induced severe systemic hypoxia in adult C57BL/6 mice using a hypoxia chamber (10% O2) for 1 week and rapidly assessed measurements within 1h compared with 18h after hypoxia. Optical coherence tomography revealed retinal tissue edema at 18h after hypoxia. Hierarchical clustering of plasma and retinal immune molecules revealed obvious segregation of the 1h posthypoxia group away from that of controls. One hour after hypoxia, there were 10 significantly increased molecules in plasma and 4 in retina. Interleukin-1ß and vascular endothelial growth factor were increased in both tissues. Concomitantly, there was significantly increased aquaporin-4, decreased Kir4.1, and increased gliosis in retinal histology. In summary, the immediate posthypoxic period is characterized by molecular changes consistent with systemic and retinal inflammation and retinal glial changes important in water transport, leading to tissue edema. This posthypoxic inflammation rapidly improves within 24h, consistent with the typically mild and transient visual disturbance in hypoxia, such as in high-altitude retinopathy. Given hypoxia increases risk of vision loss, more studies in at-risk patients, such as plasma immune profiling and in vivo retinal imaging, are needed in order to identify novel diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers of visual impairment in systemic hypoxia.","Mesentier-Louro, Louise A; Rangel, Barbara; Stell, Laurel; Shariati, M Ali; Dalal, Roopa; Nathan, Abinaya; Yuan, Ke; de Jesus Perez, Vinicio; Liao, Yaping Joyce",PLoS One,389,24

Even though vaccines against this virus have recently been introduced, the antibody generated in the process has been reported to decline quickly. This can reduce the efficacy of vaccines over time and can result in re-infections. Thus, drugs that are effective against COVID-19 can provide a second line of defence and can prevent occurrence of the severe form of the disease. The interaction between SARS-CoV2 S-protein and human ACE2 (hACE2) is essential for the infection of the virus. Thus, drugs that block this interaction could potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection into the host cells. To identify such drugs, we first analyzed the recently published crystal structure of S-protein-hACE2 complex and identified essential residues of both S-protein and hACE2 for this interaction. We used this knowledge to virtually dock a drug library containing 4115 drug molecules against S-protein for repurposing drugs that could inhibit binding of S-protein to hACE2. We identified several potential inhibitors based on their docking scores, pharmacological effects and ability to block residues of S protein required for interaction with hACE2. The top inhibitors included drugs used for the treatment of hepatitis C (velpatasvir, pibrentasvir) as well as several vitamin D derivatives. Several molecules obtained from our screen already have good experimental support in published literature. Thus, we believe that our results will facilitate the discovery of an effective drug against COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.","Singh, Adarsh; Dhar, Riddhiman",J Biomol Struct Dyn,389,16

444778,444778,444778,Orofacial adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines exist but are rare,14.8902235,6.142606,2021,"Introduction: Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) plays an important role in the management of respiratory failure. However, since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, utilization of traditional face mask NIPPV has been curtailed in part due to risk of aerosolization of respiratory particles and subsequent health care worker exposure. A randomized clinical trial in 2016 reported that an alternative interface, helmet NIPPV, may be more effective than traditional NIPPV at preventing intubation and improving mortality. The helmet NIPPV interface provides positive airway pressure, while also theoretically minimizing aerosolization, making it a feasible modality in management of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients. Case and outcomes: This report describes a single-center experience of a series of three COVID-19 patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure managed with helmet NIPPV. One patient was able to avoid intubation while a second patient was successfully extubated to NIPPV. Ultimately, the third patient was unable to avoid intubation with helmet NIPPV, although the application of the device was late in the progression of the disease. Discussion: NIPPV is an important modality in the management of respiratory failure and has been shown to reduce the need for immediate endotracheal intubation in select populations. For patients unable to tolerate facemask NIPPV, the helmet provides an alternate interface. In COVID-19 patients, the helmet interface may reduce the risk of virus exposure to health care workers from aerosolization. Based on this experience, we recommend that helmet NIPPV can be considered as a feasible option for the management of patients with COVID-19, whether the goal is to prevent immediate intubation or avoid post-extubation respiratory failure. Randomized studies are needed to definitively validate the use of helmet NIPPV in this population. Conclusion: Helmet NIPPV is a feasible therapy to manage COVID-19 patients.","Rali, Aniket S; Howard, Christopher; Miller, Rachel; Morgan, Christopher K; Mejia, Dennis; Sabo, John; Herlihy, James P; Devarajan, Sunjay R",Can J Respir Ther,389,1

Severe COVID-19 patients are at a higher risk of developing serious complications and mortality. There is a dire need for safe and effective pharmacotherapy for addressing unmet needs of these patients. Concomitant use of dexamethasone and tetracyclines, by virtue of their immunomodulatory and other relevant pharmacological properties, offers a potential strategy for synergy aimed at improving clinical outcomes.Areas covered: Here we review the potential benefits of combining dexamethasone and tetracyclines (minocycline or doxycycline) for the management of severe COVID-19 patients. We have critically examined the evidence obtained from in silico, experimental, and clinical research. We have also discussed the plausible mechanisms, advantages, and drawbacks of this proposed combination therapy for managing severe COVID-19.Expert opinion: The concomitant use of dexamethasone and one of the tetracyclines among severe COVID-19 patients offers several advantages in terms of additive immunomodulatory effects, cost-effectiveness, wide-availability, and well-known pharmacological properties including adverse-effect profile and contraindications. There is an urgent need to facilitate pilot studies followed by well-designed and adequately-powered multicentric clinical trials to generate conclusive evidence related to utility of this approach.","Singh, Harmanjit; Chauhan, Prerna; Singh, Jasbir; Gautam, C S; Kakkar, Ashish Kumar",Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,389,6

However, studies have shown that Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) may play a significant role as an auxiliary treatment for COVID-19. Objective: This study aimed to assess the effects of TCM as an auxiliary treatment for COVID-19 through a systematic review of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: Four English and three Chinese language databases were searched from December 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020. RCTs comparing TCM in combination with Western medicine (WM) with the same WM therapies alone for confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. The outcome measures were cure rate, lowering of body temperature, cough relief, improvement in chest computed tomography (CT) images, deterioration of condition, and adverse effects. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A series of meta-analyses were conducted for selected outcomes using RevMan 5.3 software. The quality of evidence was appraised using the grading of recommendation, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) recommendations. Results: Ten RCTs with a total of 1,285 patients were included. Compared with WM alone in treating COVID-19, WM with auxiliary treatment by TCM appears to have increased the cure rate (risk ratio [RR] 1.15 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.26]), relieved cough (RR 1.32 [95% CI 1.15-1.52]), improved chest CT images (RR 1.23 [95% CI 1.11-1.37]), and reduced the number of cases transitioning from a moderate to severe condition (RR 0.58 [95% CI 0.43-0.77]). The authors are uncertain whether TCM combined WM has effects on fever normalization (RR 1.10 [95% CI 0.94-1.29]) or adverse effects (RR 0.81 (95% CI 0.42-1.57]). Although they evaluated the certainty of evidence for lowering body temperature and adverse effects as very low, and low for cure rate, certainty was evaluated as moderate for improvement in chest CT images, cough relief, and deterioration of condition. Conclusion: TCM may be an effective auxiliary treatment for COVID-19 patients, which is likely to help improve the main symptoms and reduce disease progression. However, due to the limited number of studies and apparent heterogeneity among them, a more definitive conclusion on the effect of TCM on lowering body temperature and adverse effects cannot be drawn at this time.","Zhou, Le-Peng; Wang, Jie; Xie, Ri-Hua; Pakhale, Smita; Krewski, Daniel; Cameron, D William; Wen, Shi Wu",J. altern. complement. med,389,21

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CT images of 130 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 pneumonia from several hospitals in China were collected and their imaging features were analyzed and interpreted in detail. RESULTS: Among the 130 patients, we can see (1) distribution: 14 cases with unilateral lung disease and 116 cases with bilateral disease, the distribution was mainly lobular core (99 cases) and subpleural (102 cases); (2) number: 9 cases with single lesion, 113 cases with multiple lesions, and 8 cases with diffuse distribution; (3) density: 70 cases of pure ground glass opacity (GGO), and 60 cases of GGO with consolidation; (4) accompanying signs: vascular thickening (100 cases), ""parallel pleura sign"" (98 cases), ""paving stone sign"" (100 cases), ""halo sign"" (18 cases), ""reversed halo sign"" (6 cases), pleural effusion (2 cases), and pneumonocele (2 cases). After follow-up CT examination on 35 patients, 21 cases turned better and 14 became worse. There were signs of consolidation with marginal contraction, bronchiectasis, subpleural line, or fibrous streak. CONCLUSION: GGO and consolidation are the most common CT signs of COVID-19 pneumonia, mainly with lobular distribution and subpleural distribution. The main manifestations were tissue organization and fibrosis at late stage. The most valuable features are the parallel pleura sign and the paving stone sign. KEY POINTS: â¢ The CT signs of the COVID-19 pneumonia are mainly distributed in the lobular core, subpleural and diffused bilaterally. â¢ The CT signs include the ""parallel pleura sign,"" ""paving stone sign,"" ""halo sign,"" and ""reversed halo sign."" â¢ During the follow-up, the distribution of lobular core, the fusion of lesions, and the organization changes at late stage will appear.","Wu, Jing; Pan, Junping; Teng, Da; Xu, Xunhua; Feng, Jianghua; Chen, Yu-Chen",Eur Radiol,389,21

However, the impact of extracellular ATP on chemoresistance and the mechanisms behind ATP pro-invasion and pro-chemoresistance remain unclear. Here we aimed to determine the molecules or signaling pathways involved. cDNA microarray was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes before and after ATP treatment. As a result, Sex-determining region Y-box 9 (SOX9) was up-regulated after ATP treatment in breast cancer cells. In vitro invasion and migration assays demonstrated that knocking down SOX9 attenuated ATP-driven invasive capability. Mass spectrometry and co-IP revealed that SOX9 interacted with Janus kinase 1 (JAK1). Afterward, IL-6-JAK1-STAT3 signaling was demonstrated to promote SOX9 expression and invasion following ATP treatment. Notably, ATP-IL-6-SOX9 signaling was shown to stimulate chemoresistance in breast cancer cells. ChIP assays identified some potential SOX9 target genes, among which carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5/6 (CEACAM5/6) was demonstrated to mediate ATP pro-invasive function, while ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) mediated ATP-driven chemoresistance. In addition, SOX9-knockdown and apyrase (an ATP hydrolase)-treated MDA-MB-231 cells illustrated decreased tumor growth and enhanced drug sensitivity in nude mice. In vitro spheroid formation assays also proved the significance of ATP-SOX9 in mediating chemoresistance. Moreover, molecules involved in ATP-SOX9 signaling were up-regulated in human breast carcinoma specimens and were associated with poor prognosis. Altogether, SOX9 signaling is vital in ATP-driven invasion and chemoresistance, which may serve as a potential target for breast cancer therapies.","Yang, Hui; Geng, Yue-Hang; Wang, Peng; Yang, Han; Zhou, Yan-Ting; Zhang, Hong-Quan; He, Hui-Ying; Fang, Wei-Gang; Tian, Xin-Xia",Oncogene,389,24

Yet, how mRNA vaccines stimulate the immune system to elicit protective immune responses is unknown. Here we used a systems biological approach to comprehensively profile the innate and adaptive immune responses in 56 healthy volunteers vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine. Vaccination resulted in robust production of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against the parent strain and the variant of concern, B.1.351, but no induction of autoantibodies, and significant increases in antigen-specific polyfunctional CD4 and CD8 T cells after the second dose. The innate response induced within the first 2 days of booster vaccination was profoundly increased, relative to the response at corresponding times after priming. Thus, there was a striking increase in the: (i) frequency of CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocytes;(ii) concentration of IFN- y in the plasma, which correlated with enhanced pSTAT3 and pSTAT1 levels in monocytes and T cells;and (iii) transcriptional signatures of innate responses characteristic of antiviral vaccine responses against pandemic influenza, HIV and Ebola, within 2 days following booster vaccination compared to primary vaccination. Consistent with these observations, single-cell transcriptomics analysis of 242,479 leukocytes demonstrated a ~100-fold increase in the frequency of a myeloid cluster, enriched in a signature of interferon-response transcription factors (TFs) and reduced in AP-1 TFs, one day after secondary immunization, at day 21. Finally, we delineated distinct molecular pathways of innate activation that correlate with CD8 T cell and nAb responses and identified an early monocyte-related signature that was associated with the breadth of the nAb response against the B1.351 variant strain. Collectively, these data provide insights into the immune responses induced by mRNA vaccines and demonstrate their capacity to stimulate an enhanced innate response following booster immunization.","Pulendran, B.; Arunachalam, P.

There are very few community-based studies on malnutrition among the elderly, especially in India. Objectives: The objective was to find out the prevalence of malnutrition and its associated risk factors among the elderly in urbanized villages of Delhi. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted during November 2015 to April 2017 in two urbanized villages of East Delhi among 353 elderly (>60 years) individuals. A semi-structured interview schedule was used to record the sociodemographic and relevant personal details of the elderly. To determine the prevalence of malnutrition, Mini Nutritional Assessment scale was used. Statistical analysis included simple descriptive analysis and tests of significance such as Chi-square test. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of malnutrition. Results: The prevalence of possible malnutrition was found to be 49.3%. On bivariate analysis, age, gender, education status, marital and residential status, per capita income, financial dependency, and family size were found to be associated with malnutrition (P < 0.05). Age >70 years, being tenant, and financial dependency were observed to be significant predictors of possible malnutrition in multiple logistic regression. Conclusion: Malnutrition needs to be identified at an early stage using appropriate tools so that proper interventions can be directed to those who need it to ensure healthy aging.

However, mounting evidence links accelerated pathogenesis in gravely ill COVID-19 patients to a hyper-inflammatory state involving a cytokine storm. Several components of the heightened inflammatory state were addressed as therapeutic targets. Another key component of the heightened inflammatory state is hyper-ferritinemia which reportedly identifies patients with increased mortality risk. In spite of its strong association with mortality, it is not yet clear if hyper-ferritinemia in COVID-19 patients is merely a systemic marker of disease progression, or a key modulator in disease pathogenesis.

The types of messages that may be effective in alerting smokers to this risk and encouraging a quit attempt are unknown. The aim of this study was to test a series of messages to identify potentially effective communication approaches. METHODS: An online survey was completed by 1509 smokers across three countries (Australia: n = 604; New Zealand: n = 304; United Kingdom: n = 601) in April-May 2020. Respondents were randomly assigned to view just one of four quit messages, two of which explicitly referred to the coronavirus, one referred to risk of chest infection, and one encouraged cessation for financial reasons. Outcome variables included quit intentions, further information seeking, message perceptions, and health and financial concerns. RESULTS: All four messages were associated with significant differences in the proportions of respondents intending to quit within the following 2 wk (increase range: 11%-34%) and with substantial proportions of respondents electing to access additional information (range: 37%-50%). The differences in intentions were significantly larger for the two health-related messages that specifically mentioned the coronavirus. All messages were perceived favorably in terms of acceptability, believability, effectiveness, and personal relevance. Negligible differences in health and financial concerns were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Smokers in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom appear likely to be receptive to messages about their COVID-related risk. Such messages have the potential to increase quit intentions and prompt information-seeking behaviors. IMPLICATIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic represents an opportunity to encourage smokers to quit to reduce both their COVID-related risks and their risks of a broad range of noncommunicable diseases.","Pettigrew, Simone; Jun, Min; Roberts, Ian; Nallaiah, Kellie; Bullen, Chris; Rodgers, Anthony",Nicotine tob. res,389,30

Del Valle et al. corroborated these findings with regard to IL-6 and disease severity, however, they also showed IL-8 to be of significance. This may be explained by the varying techniques used by the two studies to determine severity. Further studies including critically ill patients and the analysis of mortality rates in this patient cohort would greatly enhance the clinical relevance of these findings. As speculated by Chen et al., early studies on the use of tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients were promising, however, full results from ongoing trials are required to confirm a survival benefit in patients treated with tocilizumab.

To assess learner satisfaction with the format and content of the curriculum, including relevance to learners' education and practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A webinar curriculum of fundamental reconstructive urology topics was developed through the Society of Genitourinary Reconstructive Surgeons and partnering institutions. Expert-led sessions were broadcasted. Registered participants were asked to complete a survey regarding the curriculum. Responses were used to assess the quality of the curriculum format and content, as well as participants' practice demographics. RESULTS: Our survey yielded a response rate of 34%. Survey responses showed >50% of practices offer reconstructive urologic services, with 37% offered by providers without formal fellowship training. A difference in self-reported baseline knowledge was seen amongst junior residents and attendings (P < .05). Regardless of level of training, all participants rated the topics presented as relevant to their education/practice (median response = 5/5). Responders also indicated that the curriculum supplemented their knowledge in reconstructive urology (median response = 5/5). The webinar format and overall satisfaction with the curriculum was highly rated (median response = 5/5). Participants also stated they were likely to recommend the series to others. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate success of an online curriculum in reconstructive urology. Given >50% of practices surveyed offer reconstruction, we believe the curriculum's educational benefits (increasing access and collaboration while minimizing the risk of in-person contact) will continue beyond the COVID-19 pandemic and that this will remain a relevant educational platform for urologists moving forward.","Omil-Lima, Danly; Fernstrum, Austin; Gupta, Karishma; Jella, Tarun; Muncey, Wade; Mishra, Kirtishri; Bukavina, Laura; Scarberry, Kyle; DeLong, Jessica; Nikolavsky, Dmitriy; Gupta, Shubham",Urology,389,16

Many intervention strategies have been utilized by governments around the world, including masks, social distancing, and vaccinations. However, officials making decisions regarding interventions may have a limited time to act. Computer simulations can aid them by predicting future disease outcomes, but they also have limitations due to requirements on processing power or time. This paper examines whether a machine learning model can be trained on a small subset of simulation runs to inexpensively predict future disease trajectories very close to the original simulation results. Using four previously published agent-based models for COVID-19, this paper analyzes the predictions of decision tree regression machine learning models and compares them to the results of the original simulations. The results indicate that accurate machine learning meta-models can be generated from simulation models with no strong interventions (e.g., vaccines, lockdowns) using small amounts of simulation data. However, meta-models for simulation models that include strong interventions required much more training data to achieve a similar accuracy. This indicates that machine learning meta-models could be used in some scenarios to assist in faster decision making.","Lutz, Christopher B; Giabbanelli, Philippe J.",,389,18

Opinion surveys identified the importance of political ideology in shaping perceptions of the pandemic and compliance with preventive measures. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure political partisanship and anti-science attitudes in the discussions about the pandemic on social media, as well as their geographic and temporal distributions. METHODS: We analyze a large set of tweets related to the pandemic collected between January and May of 2020 and develop methods to classify the ideological alignment of users along the moderacy (hardline vs moderate), political (liberal vs conservative) and science (anti-science vs pro-science) dimensions. RESULTS: We find a significant correlation in polarized views along the science and political dimensions. Moreover, politically moderate users are more aligned with the pro-science views, while hardline users are more aligned with anti-science views. Contrary to expectations, we do not find that polarization grows over time; instead, we see increasing activity by moderate pro-science users. We also show that anti-science conservatives in the US tend to tweet from the Southern and Northwestern states, while anti-science moderates from the Western states. The proportion of anti-science conservatives are found to correlate with COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed light on the multi-dimensional nature of polarization, and the feasibility of tracking polarized opinions about the pandemic across time and space through social media data.","Rao, Ashwin; Morstatter, Fred; Hu, Minda; Chen, Emily; Burghardt, Keith; Ferrara, Emilio; Lerman, Kristina",J. med. internet res,389,20

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was carried out involving 143 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and moderate hyperinflammation. They received standard therapy along with pulses of methylprednisolone (group 1) or methylprednisolone plus tocilizumab (group 2), with the possibility of receiving anakinra (group 3) according to protocol. The aim of this study was to assess the role of anakinra in the clinical course (death, admission to the intensive care ward) during the first 60 days after the first corticosteroid pulse. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging characteristics as well as infectious complications were also analyzed. RESULTS: 74 patients (51.7%) in group 1, 59 (41.3%) patients in group 2, and 10 patients (7%) in group 3 were included. 8 patients (10.8%) in group 1 died, 6 (10.2%) in group 2, and 0 (0%) in group 3. After adjustment for age and clinical severity indices, treatment with anakinra was associated with a reduced risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 0.518, 95% CI 0.265-0.910; p = 0.0437). Patients in group 3 had a lower mean CD4 count after 3 days of treatment. No patients in this group presented infectious complications.

METHODS: Epidemiological and clinical characteristics from the 26 asymptomatic patients with positive results for SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid testing were obtained. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (84.6%) correlated with clustering occurrence. The median period from contact to diagnosis and the last positive nucleic acid test was 19 (8-24 days) and 21.5 days (10-36 days), respectively. The median period from diagnosis to negative nucleic acid test was significantly different between patients with normal or atypical chest computed tomography (CT) findings (nâ =â 16, 61.5%; 7.5 days [2-20 days]) and patients with typical ground-glass or patchy opacities on CT (nâ =â 10, 38.5%; 12.5 days [8-22 days]; Pâ <â .01).

These problems pose immense challenges that can voraciously consume human and capital resources. Tracking the initiation, spread, and changing trends of Covid-19 at population-wide scales is one of the most daunting challenges, especially the urgent need to map the distribution and magnitude of Covid-19 in near real-time. Other than pre-exposure prophylaxis or therapeutic treatments, the most important tool is the ability to quickly identify infected individuals. The mainstay approach for epidemics has long involved the large-scale application of diagnostic testing at the individual case level. However, this approach faces overwhelming challenges in providing fast surveys of large populations. An epidemiological tool developed and refined by environmental scientists over the last 20 years (Wastewater-Based Epidemiology - WBE) holds the potential as a key tool in containing and mitigating Covid-19 outbreaks while also minimizing domino effects such as unnecessarily long stay-at-home policies that stress humans and economies alike. WBE measures chemical signatures in sewage, such as fragment biomarkers from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), simply by applying the type of clinical diagnostic testing (designed for individuals) to the collective signature of entire communities. As such, it could rapidly establish the presence of Covid-19 infections across an entire community. Surprisingly, this tool has not been widely embraced by epidemiologists or public health officials. Presented is an overview of why and how governments should exercise prudence and begin evaluating WBE and coordinating development of a standardized WBE methodology - one that could be deployed within nationalized monitoring networks to provide intercomparable data across nations.","Daughton, Christian G",Sci Total Environ,389,21

Outcomes of immediate breast-reconstruction post mastectomy in an oncoplastic breast unit during the COVID-19 pandemic,15.238095,5.931669,2021,"Executive functioning (EF) undergoes marked developmental improvements during the early school years. Given the crucial role of EF in learning and school adjustment, it is important to document the factors that bolster the development of executive competence, especially during a period of growth. Although substantial evidence suggests that parent-child relationships relate to EF, few longitudinal studies have examined the parental antecedents of EF developmental trajectories during the school years. Accordingly, this multiyear longitudinal study (N = 102) explored the respective roles of early mother-child attachment security and maternal autonomy support in the prediction of patterns of growth in working memory, cognitive flexibility, and planning skills across Grades 2 to 4. Multilevel growth curve analyses revealed a unique positive relation between attachment security and all EF skills, whereas autonomy support was mainly independently associated with initial planning performance. These findings provide further suggestion for a global contribution of secure attachment relationships to children's executive competence and highlight the importance of supporting children's autonomy to foster the emergence of more complex EF abilities such as planning. This study also supports the relevance of considering multiple aspects of parent-child relationships to delineate how early caregiving experiences contribute to children's EF development.","Regueiro, Sophie; Matte-Gagné, Célia; Bernier, Annie",J Exp Child Psychol,389,12

In Indonesia, the cases have rapidly increased, and the case fatality rate remains high. With COVID-19, most of the deaths have been caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome and dysregulation of the immune response. A lung biopsy from a patient with COVID-19 showed inflammatory cellular infiltration with diffuse alveolar damage. Massive pulmonary destruction has also been reported as a result of highly increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1ß, interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), induced protein 10 (IP-10), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). IL-6 is an inflammatory cytokine produced by various cell types, including immune cells and nonleukocytes, such as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, epithelial cells, type II pneumocytes, and certain tumor cells. Several studies have shown that IL-6 contributes to the severity and mortality of COVID-19. In this review, we would like to explore the immune response in COVID-19 and the role of IL-6 in the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19.","Khaedir, Yordan; Kartika, Rona",J Interferon Cytokine Res,389,16

Although infections are asymptomatic in 80% of cases, severe respiratory illness occurs in 20% of cases, requiring hospitalization and highly specialized intensive care. The WHO, under the International Health Regulations, declared this pandemic a public health emergency of international concern; it has affected nearly all health systems worldwide. The health system in Egypt, similar to many others, was severely challenged when confronted with the need for urgent and major expansion required to manage such a significant pandemic. This review uses publicly available data to provide an epidemiological summary of the COVID-19 pandemic behavior during the first wave of the outbreak in Egypt. The article covers mathematical modeling predictions, Egypt's healthcare system, economic and social impacts of COVID-19, as well as national responses that were crucial to the initial containment of the pandemic. We observed how the government managed the outbreak by enhancing testing capacity, contact tracing, announcing public health and social measures (PHSMs), as well as allocating extra funds and human resources to contain SARS-COV-2. Prospectively, economic losses from major sources of revenues-tourism, travel, and trade-may be reflected in future timelines, as Egypt continues to control cases and loss of life from COVID-19. Overall, trends indicate that the spread of COVID-19 in Egypt was initially contained. Revalidation of prediction models and follow-up studies may reveal the aftermath of the pandemic and how well it was managed in Egypt.","Gaye, Yai-Ellen; Agbajogu, Christopher; El Oakley, Reida",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),389,32

The aim was to examine the association between pre-existing mental health diagnosis and COVID-19 outcomes (positive screen, hospitalization, mortality). METHODS: Electronic medical record data for 30 976 adults tested for COVID-19 between March 2020 and 10th July 2020 was analyzed. COVID-19 outcomes included positive screen, hospitalization among screened positive, and mortality among screened positive and hospitalized. Primary independent variable, mental health disorders, was based on ICD-10 codes categorized as bipolar, internalizing, externalizing, and psychoses. Descriptive statistics were calculated, unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the relationship between each mental health disorder and COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: Adults with externalizing (odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95%CI 0.57-0.79) and internalizing disorders (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70-0.88) had lower odds of having a positive COVID-19 test in fully adjusted models. Adults with bipolar disorder had significantly higher odds of hospitalization in fully adjusted models (OR 4.27, 95% CI 2.06-8.86), and odds of hospitalization were significantly higher among those with externalizing disorders after adjusting for demographics (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.23-2.38). Mortality was significantly higher in the fully adjusted model for patients with bipolar disorder (hazard ratio 2.67, 95% CI 1.07-6.67). CONCLUSIONS: Adults with mental health disorders, while less likely to test positive for COVID-19, were more likely to be hospitalized and to die in the hospital. Study results suggest the importance of developing interventions that incorporate elements designed to address smoking cessation, nutrition and physical activity counseling and other needs specific to this population to improve COVID-19 outcomes.","Egede, Christine; Dawson, Aprill Z; Walker, Rebekah J; Garacci, Emma; Campbell, Jennifer A; Egede, Leonard E",Psychol Med,389,26

'Black Africans' have been categorised in the 1991-2011 censuses with added free-text in 2021 in response to user demand. However, the UK government is increasingly reporting data for the 'Black' pan-ethnicity, especially in the even more generalised 'BAME' ('Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic') acronym in COVID-19 pandemic reports. The consequences of this practice are addressed. Firstly, with respect to ethical challenges, Black Africans find their conscription by government into the term BAME offensive and do not accept it as a self-descriptor. This labelling, which subsumes Black Africans' self-assigned ethnicity in the census, and consequent misrecognition may be interpreted as a micro-aggression (a term coined in the 1970s but used here to denote microinvalidation), as suggested in the current black activism of the 'Black Lives Matter movement'. Secondly, ONS has warned that concealed heterogeneity renders the pan-ethnicities unreliably crude, making them scientifically inaccurate. Analysts are recommended to present ethnic group data for the full census classification where possible for reasons of validity and respect for the patient as arbiter of their ethnic group.","Aspinall, Peter J",Sociol. health illn,389,24

OBJECTIVES: This pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) aimed to evaluate feasibility and efficacy of an adapted MBCT program for AYA, aged 16-29, with IBD. METHODS: Sixty-four AYAs were randomly allocated to MBCT (n = 33) or treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 31). Primary outcome measure was the depression score on Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. Secondary outcomes included anxiety, stress, IBD-related quality of life, coping, mindfulness, post-traumatic growth, medication adherence, IBD activity, inflammatory markers, microbiome characteristics and brain functional connectivity. RESULTS: Study recruitment rate was 75%, retention rate 70%, and session attendance 92%. Intention to treat analyses revealed that, compared to TAU group, MBCT group had significantly lower depression (&#8710; = -6.0; 95%CI = -10.8 to -1.2; P = 0.015) and stress (&#8710; = -5.1; 95%CI = -10.1 to -0.0; P = 0.049), higher active coping (&#8710; = 1.0;95%CI = 0.1-1.9; P = 0.022), and total mindfulness scores (&#8710; = 10.9;95%CI = 1.1-20.8; P = 0.030) at 8 weeks (post-therapy), and improved coping by positive reframing (&#8710; = 1.1;95%CI = 0.0-2.2; P = 0.043) and planning (&#8710; = 0.9;95%CI = 0.0-1.9; P = 0.045), mindful awareness (&#8710; = 5.2.;95%CI = 2.0-8.5; P = 0.002) and total mindfulness scores (&#8710; = 10.8.;95%CI = 0.4-21.1; P = 0.042) at 20 weeks. On per protocol analysis, MBCT group had significantly lower depression (&#8710; = -6.3; 95%CI = -11.4 to -1.2; P = 0.015), stress (&#8710; = -6.0; 95%CI = -11.2 to -0.5; P = 0.032), increased active coping (&#8710; = 0.9;95%CI = 0-1.7; P = 0.05) at 8 weeks, and mindful awareness (&#8710; = 5.4; 95%CI = 2.1-8.6; P = 0.001) at 20 weeks. CONCLUSION: In AYAs with IBD, MBCT is feasible and beneficial in improving depression, stress, mindfulness and adaptive coping. It holds promise as an important component of integrated IBD care.

Instruments developed for telephone screening are not as well validated as traditional neuropsychological measures. Therefore, the current study presents preliminary validation of a telephone version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (T-MoCA) in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). METHOD: Twenty-one persons with PD completed the T-MoCA along with a traditional neuropsychological battery. Diagnostic accuracy for the presence of PD-related mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and correlations with traditional neuropsychological measures are reported. RESULTS: Individuals with MCI (n = 9) scored lower than individuals without cognitive impairment (17.56 vs. 19.50; t = -2.28, p = .03, d = -1.00). Diagnostic accuracy for MCI ranged from 76% to 81%, with sensitivity ranging from 0.56 to 0.67 and specificity ranging from 0.92 to 1.00. Correlations of T-MoCA derived scores with traditional neuropsychological measures were quite modest, with the exception of the memory impairment scale. CONCLUSIONS: This rapid communication presents preliminary validation of the T-MoCA for use in individuals with PD.

We previously showed that tannic acid-modified AgNPs sized >26 nm promote wound healing, while tannic acid-modified AgNPs sized 13 nm can elicit strong local inflammatory response. In this study, we tested bimetallic Au@AgNPs sized 30 nm modified with selected flavonoid and non-flavonoid compounds for wound healing applications. Methods: Bimetallic Au@AgNPs were obtained by growing an Ag layer on AuNPs and further modified with selected polyphenols. After toxicity tests and in vitro scratch assay in HaCaT cells, modified lymph node assay as well as the mouse splint wound model were further used to access the wound healing potential of selected non-toxic modifications. Results: Tannic acid, gallic acid, polydatin, resveratrol, catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin gallate and procyanidin B2 used to modify Au@AgNPs exhibited good toxicological profiles in HaCaT cells. Au@AgNPs modified with 15 µM tannic acid, 200 µM resveratrol, 200 µM epicatechin gallate, 1000 µM gallic acid and 200 µM procyanidin B2 induced wound healing in vivo and did not lead to the local irritation or inflammation. Tannic acid-modified Au@AgNPs induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) - like re-epithelialization, while other polyphenol modifications of Au@AgNPs acted through proliferation and wound closure. Conclusion: Bimetallic Au@AgNPs can be used as a basis for modification with selected polyphenols for topical uses. In addition, we have demonstrated that particular polyphenols used to modify bimetallic nanoparticles may show different effects upon different stages of wound healing.","Orlowski, Piotr; Zmigrodzka, Magdalena; Tomaszewska, Emilia; Ranoszek-Soliwoda, Katarzyna; Pajak, Beata; Slonska, Anna; Cymerys, Joanna; Celichowski, Grzegorz; Grobelny, Jaroslaw; Krzyzowska, Malgorzata",Int J Nanomedicine,389,32

SUBJECTS: Subjects included English and Spanish speaking adults in the USA. MEASURES: Measures included assessment of patient portal use, patient portal access, understanding health information, usefulness of health records, and privacy and security. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, sex, income, and education, there was a significant association between race/ethnicity and patient portal non-users responding, ""no need to use online medical record"" as the reason for not using the patient portal (P = 0.005).

The treatments of anti-tumor chemo-agents recruit more tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) which are highly implicated in the chemoresistance development, but the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#945; (HIF1&#945;) in GC cells is activated upon 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment and results in much more accumulation of M2-type TAMs which protect tumor cells from chemo-agents. Mechanistically, in the GC cells under the 5-FU treatment, reactive oxygen species is accumulated and then induces the activation of HIF1&#945; signaling to drive the expression of high-mobility group box 1, which leads to more macrophage's infiltration into GC tumor. In turn, the recruited TAMs exhibit tumor-protected M2-type phenotype and promote the chemoresistance of GC cells via producing growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) to exacerbate the fatty acid ß-oxidation in tumor cells. Blocking GDF15 using antibody or inhibiting FAO of tumor cells by etomoxir efficiently gave rise to the tumor cell sensitivity to 5-FU. Therefore, our study demonstrates a novel insight in understanding the cross talking between tumor cells and immune microenvironment and provides new therapeutic targets for clinic treatments of gastric cancer.","Yu, Shan; Li, Qian; Yu, Yiyi; Cui, Yuehong; Li, Wei; Liu, Tianshu; Liu, Fenglin",,389,24

We present seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlates of seropositivity immediately after the first wave. METHODS: From a serosurvey of adult NYC residents (May 13-July 21, 2020), we calculated the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies stratified by participant demographics, symptom history, health status, and employment industry. We used multivariable regression models to assess associations between participant characteristics and seropositivity. RESULTS: Seroprevalence among 45,367 participants was 23.6% (95% CI, 23.2%-24.0%). High seroprevalence (>30%) was observed among Black and Hispanic individuals, people from high poverty neighborhoods, and people in health care or essential worker industry sectors. COVID-19 symptom history was associated with seropositivity (adjusted relative risk=2.76; 95% CI, 2.65-2.88). Other risk factors included sex, age, race/ethnicity, residential area, employment sector, working outside the home, contact with a COVID-19 case, obesity, and increasing numbers of household members. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a large serosurvey in a single U.S. jurisdiction, we estimate that just under one-quarter of NYC adults were infected in the first few months of the COVID-19 epidemic. Given disparities in infection risk, effective interventions for at-risk groups are needed during ongoing transmission.","Pathela, Preeti; Crawley, Addie; Weiss, Don; Maldin, Beth; Cornell, Jennifer; Purdin, Jeff; Schumacher, Pamela K; Marovich, Stacey; Li, Joyce; Daskalakis, Demetre",J. infect. dis,389,26

PATIENTS AND METHODS: RNA was extracted from cardiac tissue flash frozen at therapeutic surgical septal myectomy for 106 patients with HCM and 39 healthy donor hearts. Expression profiling of 37,846 genes was performed using the Illumina Human HT-12v3 Expression BeadChip. All patients with HCM were genotyped for pathogenic variants causing HCM. Technical validation was performed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. This study was started on January 1, 1999, and final analysis was completed on April 20, 2020. RESULTS: Overall, 22% of the transcriptome (8443 of 37,846 genes) was expressed differentially between HCM and control tissues. Analysis by genotype revealed that gene expression changes were similar among genotypic subgroups of HCM, with only 4% (1502 of 37,846) to 6% (2336 of 37,846) of the transcriptome exhibiting differential expression between genotypic subgroups. The qRT-PCR confirmed differential expression in 92% (11 of 12 genes) of tested transcripts. Notably, in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the transcript for angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a negative regulator of the angiotensin system, was the single most up-regulated gene in HCM (fold-change, 3.53; q-value =1.30×10-23), which was confirmed by qRT-PCR in triplicate (fold change, 3.78; P=5.22×10-4), and Western blot confirmed greater than 5-fold overexpression of ACE2 protein (fold change, 5.34; P=1.66×10-6). CONCLUSION: More than 20% of the transcriptome is expressed differentially between HCM and control tissues. Importantly, ACE2 was the most up-regulated gene in HCM, indicating perhaps the heart's compensatory effort to mount an antihypertrophic, antifibrotic response. However, given that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses ACE2 for viral entry, this 5-fold increase in ACE2 protein may confer increased risk for COVID-19 manifestations and outcomes in patients with increased ACE2 transcript expression and protein levels in the heart.","Bos, J Martijn; Hebl, Virginia B; Oberg, Ann L; Sun, Zhifu; Herman, Daniel S; Teekakirikul, Polakit; Seidman, Jonathan G; Seidman, Christine E; Dos Remedios, Cristobal G; Maleszewski, Joseph J; Schaff, Hartzell V; Dearani, Joseph A; Noseworthy, Peter A; Friedman, Paul A; Ommen, Steve R; Brozovich, Frank V; Ackerman, Michael J",Mayo Clin Proc,389,1

(Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a cosmopolitan pest of stored cereal grains and other commodities globally. Infestations caused by S. oryzae makes grains unsuitable for consumption, processing, and export. Deltamethrin, a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide, is widely used in major grain storages in India as a prophylactic treatment to control this pest. However, recurrent use of this insecticide had led to genetic resistance in S. oryzae, questioning its ongoing use at the current recommended concentration. RESULTS: Dose response analysis of resistant (Delta-R) and susceptible (Lab-S) strains of S. oryzae collected from grain storages across southern India, revealed that Delta-R was 134-fold more resistant than the Lab-S at LC50 . A concentration of 180 ppm over 48 h effectively discriminated 16 resistant field populations from Lab-S with per cent resistance ranging from 8.72 to 75.86%. Exposing all the resistant populations to 1000 ppm over 48 h identified twelve populations with strongly resistant individuals and confirmed the existence of two distinct resistance phenotypes, 'weak' and 'strong' in S. oryzae. Furthermore, sequence analysis of the vgsc gene in Delta-R identified a single target site mutation, T929I conferring resistance in S. oryzae. CAPS marker analysis of this allele confirmed that frequency of resistance is high (up to 0.96) supporting the results of phenotypic analysis. CONCLUSION: Both phenotype and molecular marker analyses clearly demonstrated that deltamethrin at 180 and 1000 ppm can be used to discriminate weakly and strongly resistant populations in S. oryzae, respectively. Resistance diagnostics based on the mutation, T929I, supports our phenotypic data and indicates that resistance to deltamethrin in S. oryzae is prevalent in southern parts of India, stressing the need to identify a synergist or suitable alternatives.

Methods: A preeclampsia rat model was established, and the effects of low molecular heparin on preeclampsia via the p38MAPK signaling pathway were analyzed based on intervention of the rats with different combinations of low molecular heparin and p38MAPK signaling pathway activator. Furthermore, a hypoxia/reoxygenation model of trophoblasts in vitro was established to explore the effects of low molecular heparin on trophoblasts via the p38MAPK signaling pathway. Results: After treatment with low molecular heparin, pregnant rats in the heparin group showed significantly decreased blood pressure, 24 h proteinuria, and p38MAPK protein levels in placenta tissues and decreased apoptosis rate of placenta tissue cells (all P < 0.05) and showed more fetal rats and lowered weight of them (both P < 0.05) but showed no significant change in the weight of placenta (all P > 0.05). Pregnant rats treated with low molecular heparin and p38MAPK activator showed significantly higher blood pressure, 24 h proteinuria, and p38MAPK protein levels in placenta tissues and apoptosis rate of placenta tissue cells than those of pregnant rats in the heparin group (all P < 0.05) and also showed less fetal rats and lighter fetal rats than those in the heparin group (both P < 0.05) but showed no difference with them in the weight of placenta (P > 0.05). Further analysis revealed that low molecular heparin could protect the survival and migration of trophoblasts under hypoxia/reoxygenation conditions and reduce apoptosis of them (all P < 0.05). Conclusion: Low molecular heparin can alleviate preeclampsia by inhibiting the p38MAPK signaling pathway and can inhibit apoptosis of trophoblasts and promote proliferation and migration of them.","Quan, Dandan; Li, Li; Zuo, Manzhen",Comput Math Methods Med,389,32

TRIAL DESIGN: ASCOT is an investigator-initiated, multi-centre, open-label, randomised controlled trial. Participants will have been hospitalised with confirmed COVID-19, and will be randomised 1:1:1:1 to receive lopinavir /ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, both or neither drug in addition to standard of care management. PARTICIPANTS: Participants will be recruited from >80 hospitals across Australia and New Zealand, representing metropolitan and regional centres in both public and private sectors. Admitted patients will be eligible if aged &#8805; 18 years, have confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid testing in the past 12 days and are expected to remain an inpatient for at least 48 hours from the time of randomisation. Potentially eligible participants will be excluded if admitted to intensive care or requiring high level respiratory support, are currently receiving study drugs or their use is contraindicated due to allergy, drug interaction or comorbidities (including baseline QTc prolongation of 470ms for women or 480ms for men), or death is anticipated imminently. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Participants will be randomised 1:1:1:1 to: Group 1: standard of care; Group 2: lopinavir (400mg) / ritonavir (100mg) twice daily for 10 days in tablet form; Group 3: hydroxychloroquine (800mg) 4x200mg administered 12 hours apart on Day 1, followed by 400mg twice a day for 6 days; Group 4: lopinavir /ritonavir plus hydroxychloroquine. MAIN OUTCOMES: Proportion of participants alive and not having required intensive respiratory support (invasive or non-invasive ventilation) at 15 days after enrolment. A range of clinical and virological secondary outcomes will also be evaluated. RANDOMISATION: The randomisation schedule will be generated by an independent statistician. Randomisation will be stratified by site and will be in permuted blocks of variable block size. The randomised sequence allocation will only be accessible to the data management group, and site investigators will have individual participant allocation provided through a web-based trial enrolment platform. BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label study, with researchers assessing the laboratory outcomes blinded to treatment allocation. No unblinding procedures relating to potential adverse effects are therefore required. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): We assumed that 5% of participants receiving standard of care would meet the primary outcome, aimed to evaluate whether interventions could lead to a relative risk of 0.5, assuming no interaction between intervention arms. This corresponds to a required sample size of 610 per arm, with a 5% two-sided significance level (alpha) and 80% power. The total sample size therefore is planned to be 2440.

To this purpose, we analyzed twenty popular weekly routes and the potential impact of sex and relationship status (single versus coupled) on the reported level of spatial-social activity during the quarantine in Russia between March and June 2020 (N = 492). Our study revealed a significant difference between men's and women's mobility: men, in general, tend to exhibit substantially higher spatial activity. The results have shown that individuals living on their own have more social interactions with friends and exhibit more profound spatial mobility via public transport. On the other hand, spatial activity of coupled individuals of both sexes were mostly devoted to solving a list of economic and matrimonial tasks. At the same time, men already cohabiting with a partner leave their homes for dating purposes more frequently than single men and women. We interpret these findings in the sense that both individual and sex-specific differences in observed sociality could be a result of a fine-tuned adaptive populational response to a contemporary virus threat, predominantly rooted in the evolution of behavioral strategies in the reproductive and economic spheres of each sex. Indeed, unlike women, coupled men have been preserving highly risky and intense social behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Semenova, O.; Apalkova, J.; Butovskaya, M.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],389,5

Further cases have since been reported in multiple countries. The reporting rates of these events indicate that they are very rare given the high numbers of vaccinated persons. Males and younger vaccinees appear more frequently affected, more often following the second vaccine dose. As vaccine programmes progress with the focus shifting to younger people, it is possible that more cases of myocarditis and pericarditis will be reported. ObjectivesTo bring together spontaneously reported data from around the world to estimate the reporting rate in different countries and better understand the risk factors for myocarditis and pericarditis following exposure to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. MethodsSpontaneous reports from the United Kingdom, United States, and European Economic Area were used to estimate the frequency of myocarditis and pericarditis reported following COVID-19 Vaccine Pfizer/BioNTech and COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna. Cases were stratified by age, sex, and vaccine dose where data were available. Reporting rates amongst vaccinees receiving mRNA vaccines in each region were estimated. ResultsA small number of reports of myocarditis and pericarditis had been submitted to each database examined. These events are very rare according to reporting rates of spontaneous adverse reactions. The events were more frequently reported amongst males, and most reports came from vaccinees aged under 30 years. The typical clinical course of these events is mild, with full recovery in most cases. ConclusionsThis study provides evidence that younger vaccinees more frequently report myocarditis and pericarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccines compared with older vaccinees.

According to the diagnosis and treatment guidelines of China, negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the key criterion for discharging COVID-19 patients. However, repeated RT-PCR tests lead to medical waste and prolonged hospital stays for COVID-19 patients during the recovery period. Our purpose is to assess a model based on chest computed tomography (CT) radiomic features and clinical characteristics to predict RT-PCR negativity during clinical treatment. METHODS: From February 10 to March 10, 2020, 203 mild COVID-19 patients in Fangcang Shelter Hospital were retrospectively included (training: n = 141; testing: n = 62), and clinical characteristics were collected. Lung abnormalities on chest CT images were segmented with a deep learning algorithm. CT quantitative features and radiomic features were automatically extracted. Clinical characteristics and CT quantitative features were compared between RT-PCR-negative and RT-PCR-positive groups. Univariate logistic regression and Spearman correlation analyses identified the strongest features associated with RT-PCR negativity, and a multivariate logistic regression model was established. The diagnostic performance was evaluated for both cohorts. RESULTS: The RT-PCR-negative group had a longer time interval from symptom onset to CT exams than the RT-PCR-positive group (median 23 vs. 16 days, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the other clinical characteristics or CT quantitative features. In addition to the time interval from symptom onset to CT exams, nine CT radiomic features were selected for the model. ROC curve analysis revealed AUCs of 0.811 and 0.812 for differentiating the RT-PCR-negative group, with sensitivity/specificity of 0.765/0.625 and 0.784/0.600 in the training and testing datasets, respectively. CONCLUSION: The model combining CT radiomic features and clinical data helped predict RT-PCR negativity during clinical treatment, indicating the proper time for RT-PCR retesting.","Cai, Quan; Du, Si-Yao; Gao, Si; Huang, Guo-Liang; Zhang, Zheng; Li, Shu; Wang, Xin; Li, Pei-Ling; Lv, Peng; Hou, Gang; Zhang, Li-Na",BMC Med Imaging,389,21

The study of cardiac troponin' kinetic release is the recommended approach to differentiate acute from chronic injury, in order to clinically manage different cardiac diseases. AIM: To investigate whether serial measurements of high sensitivity troponin I (hs-cTnI) might provide additional information in SARS-CoV-2 patients's clinical management. METHODS: 113 consecutive patients suffering from microbiology proven SARS-CoV2-infection have been studied. Hs-cTnI has been measured in lithium-heparin plasma samples using STAT High Sensitive Troponin I (Architect i2000, Abbott Diagnostics), being 99th percentiles 16 and 34 ng/L for females and males respectively. RESULTS: In 69 out of 113 patients hs-cTnI has been measured, showing in 31 (45%) values higher than 99th percentiles in at least one occasion. In 50 patients (72%) a kinetic evaluation (at least 2 measurements during 24 h) has been carried out. Patients were subdivided into five groups: 1 (n = 44) and 2 (n = 19) no measurement of hs-cTnI or no monitoring respectively; 3 (n = 15) no significant variations during monitoring; 4 (n = 8) and 5 (n = 27) significant variations with values persistently below or sometimes higher than 99th percentiles, respectively. Group 5 patients had a longer hospital stay (median 37 days, p = 0.0001), a more aggressive disease (6 out of 27, 22%, died), more often need admission to ICU (n = 25, 92.6%, p < 0.0001), and show one or more peak values, sometime preceded by severe hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS: In SARS-CoV-2 patients, hs-cTnI serial monitoring may provide additional data to stratify risk, establish prognosis and gaining epidemiological insight on cardiac involvement in this pandemic disease.","Zaninotto, Martina; Mion, Monica Maria; Padoan, Andrea; Babuin, Luciano; Plebani, Mario",Clin Chim Acta,389,20

A mixed methods online survey was used to examine these factors during social distancing mid-lockdown, July 2020. Participants were asked to state whether loneliness, wellbeing, social activity, and social support had changed since pre-social distancing, and to provide details of strategies used to keep socially active. A total of 1429 adults (84% aged 60+ years) living in Scotland took part. The majority reported that social distancing regulations made them experience more loneliness and less social contact and support. Loneliness during lockdown was higher than reported norms for this age group before the pandemic. A larger social network, more social contact, and better perceived social support seemed to be protective against loneliness and poor wellbeing. Positive coping strategies reported included increasing online social contact with both existing social networks and reconnecting with previous networks, as well as increasing contact with neighbours and people in the community. This underlines the importance of addressing loneliness and social support in older adults but particularly during situations where risk of isolation is high.","Tomaz, Simone A; Coffee, Pete; Ryde, Gemma C; Swales, Bridgitte; Neely, Kacey C; Connelly, Jenni; Kirkland, Andrew; McCabe, Louise; Watchman, Karen; Andreis, Federico; Martin, Jack G; Pina, Ilaria; Whittaker, Anna C",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),389,7

Sometimes, but not often, a coronavirus can infect both animals and humans. An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 or SARS-CoV-2 previously known as 2019-nCoV) was identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as it spread throughout China and subsequently across the globe. As of 14th July 2020, a total of 13.1 million confirmed cases globally and 572,426 deaths had been reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the ß-coronavirus family and shares extensive genomic identity with bat coronavirus suggesting that bats are the natural host. SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as that for SARS-CoV, the coronavirus associated with the SARS outbreak in 2003. It mainly spreads through the respiratory tract with lymphopenia and cytokine storms occuring in the blood of subjects with severe disease. This suggests the existence of immunological dysregulation as an accompanying event during severe illness caused by this virus. The early recognition of this immunological phenotype could assist prompt recognition of patients who will progress to severe disease. Here we review the data of the immune response during COVID-19 infection. The current review summarizes our understanding of how immune dysregulation and altered cytokine networks contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 patients.","Mortaz, Esmaeil; Tabarsi, Payam; Varahram, Mohammad; Folkerts, Gert; Adcock, Ian M",Front Immunol,389,16

Seeking medical care for children has been described as an important measure of reducing mortality occasioned by morbidity. This study examined factors influencing mothers' health seeking behaviour for their children in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: This study made use of data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of 31 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The study involved 75,982 children who received or did not receive measles vaccine and 93,142 children who sought or did not seek medical care when affected by fever or cough and diarrhoea. Binary logistic regression was applied in the analysis. RESULTS: Most of the children (74%) received measles vaccine while less than one-fifth sought medical care for fever or cough (16%) and diarrhoea (10%). Majority of the children of women who received measles vaccine and sought medical care when they had fever or cough are from richest households. Children of women with primary and secondary or higher education, children of working women and children of women that attended antenatal care during pregnancy are more likely to seek medical care for fever or cough. While children of women who live in urban areas and children of second or higher order of birth are less likely to receive measles vaccine, children aged 24-35 months and those who were of average size at birth are less likely to seek medical care for diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS: This study has revealed that mothers' health care seeking behaviour for their children is influenced by social, maternal and child factors. Any intervention aimed at improving child health in sub-Sharan Africa should take these factors into consideration.","Adedokun, Sulaimon T; Yaya, Sanni",BMC Health Serv Res,389,21

METHODS: Five frontline echocardiographers performed and interpreted B-TTE for 30 patients with COVID-19 in the isolation wards, and the on-site B-TTE reports (OSR) were generated. Then remote consultation over the 30 B-TTE studies was conducted by two experienced echocardiographic consultants while blinded to the OSR, and the corresponding remote consultation reports (RCR) were generated. Subsequently, the five frontline echocardiographers were convened together to discuss the difference between the OSR and RCR, and to confirm the correct interpretation and the misdiagnosis using a ""majority-vote"" consensus as the diagnostic ""gold standard"". Afterwards the reasons for the misdiagnosis were given by the frontline echocardiographers themselves. The inter-rater agreement between the OSR and the ""gold standard"" was assessed using Kappa coefficient and percent agreement. RESULTS: Complete correctness of the 30 copies of the RCR were determined by the 5 frontline echocardiographers. The reliability of the OSR in the findings of cardiac chamber dilation, left ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary hypertension were weak (Kappa <0.6). The reliability of the OSR in the recognition of major cardiac abnormalities was very weak (Kappa =0.304, percent agreement =63.3%). Misdiagnosis of major abnormalities was found in 11 copies of OSR (11/30, 36.7%). CONCLUSIONS: The protocol of RC-B-TTE has shown noticeable superiority in ameliorating diagnostic accuracy of echocardiography, which should be generalized to clinical practice during the COVID-19 or similar pandemic.","Lu, Jing; Lin, Jun; Yin, Lixue; Shi, Rui; Li, Huanxing; Ge, Yang; Luo, Jing",Echocardiography,389,16

Objective: To determine whether the presence of a prolonged QT on admission is an independent factor for mortality in SARS-Cov2 hospitalized patients. Methods: Single-center cohort of 623 consecutive patients with positive polymerase-chain-reaction test (PCR) to SARS Cov2, recruited from 27 February to 7 April 2020. An electrocardiogram was taken on these patients within the first 48 h after diagnosis and before the administration of any medication with a known effect on QT interval. A prolonged QT interval was defined as a corrected QT (QTc) interval &gt;480 milliseconds. Patients were followed up with until 10 May 2020. Results: Sixty-one patients (9.8%) had prolonged QTc and only 3.2% had a baseline QTc &gt; 500 milliseconds. Patients with prolonged QTc were older, had more comorbidities, and higher levels of immune-inflammatory markers.

The spectrum of neurologic involvement in children and adolescents is unclear. Objective: To understand the range and severity of neurologic involvement among children and adolescents associated with COVID-19. Setting, Design, and Participants: Case series of patients (age <21 years) hospitalized between March 15, 2020, and December 15, 2020, with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test result (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and/or antibody) at 61 US hospitals in the Overcoming COVID-19 public health registry, including 616 (36%) meeting criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Patients with neurologic involvement had acute neurologic signs, symptoms, or diseases on presentation or during hospitalization. Life-threatening involvement was adjudicated by experts based on clinical and/or neuroradiologic features. Exposures: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Main Outcomes and Measures: Type and severity of neurologic involvement, laboratory and imaging data, and outcomes (death or survival with new neurologic deficits) at hospital discharge. Results: Of 1695 patients (909 [54%] male; median [interquartile range] age, 9.1 [2.4-15.3] years), 365 (22%) from 52 sites had documented neurologic involvement. Patients with neurologic involvement were more likely to have underlying neurologic disorders (81 of 365 [22%]) compared with those without (113 of 1330 [8%]), but a similar number were previously healthy (195 [53%] vs 723 [54%]) and met criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (126 [35%] vs 490 [37%]). Among those with neurologic involvement, 322 (88%) had transient symptoms and survived, and 43 (12%) developed life-threatening conditions clinically adjudicated to be associated with COVID-19, including severe encephalopathy (n = 15; 5 with splenial lesions), stroke (n = 12), central nervous system infection/demyelination (n = 8), Guillain-Barré syndrome/variants (n = 4), and acute fulminant cerebral edema (n = 4). Compared with those without life-threatening conditions (n = 322), those with life-threatening neurologic conditions had higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (median, 12.2 vs 4.4) and higher reported frequency of D-dimer greater than 3 µg/mL fibrinogen equivalent units (21 [49%] vs 72 [22%]). Of 43 patients who developed COVID-19-related life-threatening neurologic involvement, 17 survivors (40%) had new neurologic deficits at hospital discharge, and 11 patients (26%) died. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, many children and adolescents hospitalized for COVID-19 or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children had neurologic involvement, mostly transient symptoms. A range of life-threatening and fatal neurologic conditions associated with COVID-19 infrequently occurred.

In stochastic multicriteria decision-making models, the risk attitude of the decision maker is a relevant factor. Traditionally, the shape of a utility function is the only element that represents the decision maker's risk attitude. The eduction process of multi-attribute utility functions implies some operational drawbacks, and it is not always easy. In this paper, we propose a new element with which the decision maker's risk attitude can be implemented: the selection of the stochastic efficiency concept to be used during a decision analysis. We suggest representing the risk attitude as a conflict between two poles: risk neutral attitude, associated with best expectations, and risk aversion attitude, associated with a lower uncertainty. The Extended Goal Programming formulation has inspired the parameter that is introduced in a new risk attitude formulation. This parameter reflects the trade-off between the two classical poles with respect to risk attitude. Thus, we have produced a new stochastic efficiency concept that we call Compromise Efficiency.","Ribes, Juan; González-Pachón, Jacinto",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),389,33

Running Interrupted Time Series regressions I find that, on aggregate, there was a decrease of satisfaction with the government and the economy immediately after the crisis, but an increase for health and educational services. Longer term, satisfaction gradually increased for all the four indicators examined. In separate regressions for each country, a consistent pattern of behavior emerges. Where the short-term effect on satisfaction was negative, the long-term effect was positive, and vice versa. The switch, from short-term negative to long-term positive effect, could be attributed to the successful efforts of governments to correct the immediate adverse effects of the crisis. On the contrary, some individuals seeing the problems other countries faced, applauded their own government's short term performance in handling the crisis.

Teachers were required to put remote teaching and learning in place with only two days' notice from the government. AIMS: The current study explores teachers' experiences of this abrupt change to their working practices, and during the 5-6 weeks that followed. SAMPLE: Twenty-four teachers from English state schools were interviewed, representing mainstream primary and secondary schools and a range of years of experience and seniority. METHODS: Participants were asked to tell stories of three key scenes during the first 5-6 weeks of lockdown: a low point, a high point, and a turning point. A reflexive thematic analysis of their narratives was conducted. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Six themes were identified: uncertainty, finding a way, worry for the vulnerable, importance of relationships, teacher identity, and reflections. Teachers' narratives suggest that, after an initial period of uncertainty they settled into the situation and found a way forward, supported by strong relationships. However, they remain extremely worried about the most vulnerable pupils and want more joined-up thinking from the government on how to support them effectively, along with clarity from policymakers to enable planning ahead. Teachers reflected on how to use their learning during this period to improve pupils' experiences of education post-COVID-19, and on how aspects of shared teacher identity have worked as stressors and coping mechanisms. These initial interviews form the baseline for a longitudinal interview study of teachers' experiences of COVID-19 in England.","Kim, Lisa E; Asbury, Kathryn",Br J Educ Psychol,389,1

These strategies, however, carry a significant risk for mental health, which can lead to increased short-term and long-term mortality and is currently not included in modeling the impact of the pandemic. METHODS: We used years of life lost (YLL) as the main outcome measure, applied to Switzerland as an example. We focused on suicide, depression, alcohol use disorder, childhood trauma due to domestic violence, changes in marital status, and social isolation, as these are known to increase YLL in the context of imposed restriction in social contact and freedom of movement. We stipulated a minimum duration of mitigation of 3 months based on current public health plans. RESULTS: The study projects that the average person would suffer 0.205 YLL due to psychosocial consequence of COVID-19 mitigation measures. However, this loss would be entirely borne by 2.1% of the population, who will suffer an average of 9.79 YLL. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented here are likely to underestimate the true impact of the mitigation strategies on YLL. However, they highlight the need for public health models to expand their scope in order to provide better estimates of the risks and benefits of mitigation.","Moser, Dominik A; Glaus, Jennifer; Frangou, Sophia; Schechter, Daniel S",Eur Psychiatry,389,5

The cytokine components of this environment may determine efficacy or otherwise of glucocorticoid therapy. The immunity modulators, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the nuclear NAD+-consuming enzyme poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP 1) may play a critical role in COVID-19 pathophysiology. The AhR is overexpressed in coronaviruses, including COVID-19 and, as it regulates PARP gene expression, the latter is likely to be activated in COVID-19. PARP 1 activation leads to cell death mainly by depletion of NAD+ and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), especially when availability of these energy mediators is compromised. PARP expression is enhanced in other lung conditions: the pneumovirus respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). I propose that PARP 1 activation is the terminal point in a sequence of events culminating in patient mortality and should be the focus of COVID-19 immunotherapy. Potent PARP 1 inhibitors are undergoing trials in cancer, but a readily available inhibitor, nicotinamide (NAM), which possesses a highly desirable biochemical and activity profile, merits exploration. It conserves NAD+ and prevents ATP depletion by PARP 1 and Sirtuin 1 (silent mating type information regulation 2 homologue 1) inhibition, enhances NAD+ synthesis, and hence that of NADP+ which is a stronger PARP inhibitor, reverses lung injury caused by ischaemia/reperfusion, inhibits proinflammatory cytokines and is effective against HIV infection. These properties qualify NAM for therapeutic use initially in conjunction with standard clinical care or combined with other agents, and subsequently as an adjunct to stronger PARP 1 inhibitors or other drugs.","Badawy, Abdulla A-B",Biosci. rep,389,16

A monocentric experience,15.096069,8.318538,2020,"Background: There has been an alarming increase in discrimination and violence towards Asians during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic amid reports that the virus was first detected in China. In an incident involving a COVID-19-related physical assault, this study examined whether economic hardship experienced by participants during the pandemic and the race of the victim (Chinese, White) would influence support to compensate a victim and punish the assailant. The study also explored whether the perception that the victim experienced emotional and physical suffering due to the assault would mediate the relationships. Method: Participants in India and the United States reported on their own economic hardship due to the pandemic. They then read about an incident in which an innocent person suffered a COVID-19-related physical and verbal attack, and indicated if they would support punishing the assailant and financially compensating the victim. Results: When the victim was Chinese, participants experiencing a high degree of COVID-19 economic hardship were less likely to support financially compensating the victim or punishing the assailant compared to when the victim was White. Furthermore, when the victim was Chinese, the negative associations between economic hardship and financially compensating the victim and punishing the assailant were mediated by reduced recognition that the victim suffered emotional trauma and pain as a result of the attack. Conclusions: COVID-19-driven economic hardship experienced by participants predicted an array of reactions that reflected reduced recognition of the civil and human rights of a victim of a COVID-19-related assault. These findings have significant implications for mental health, public health, and the justice system, and underscore the pressing need for prompt action to mitigate economic hardship and to address racism and discrimination.","Johnson, James; Sattler, David N; Otton, Kylie",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),389,10

A key component of COVID-19 control efforts is serological testing to determine the community prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and quantify individual immune responses to prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. Here, we describe a laboratory-developed antibody test that uses readily available research-grade reagents to detect SARS-CoV-2 exposure in patient blood samples with high sensitivity and specificity. We further show that this sensitive test affords the estimation of viral spike-specific IgG titers from a single sample measurement, thereby providing a simple and scalable method to measure the strength of an individual's immune response. The accuracy, adaptability, and cost-effectiveness of this test make it an excellent option for clinical deployment in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.IMPORTANCE Serological surveillance has become an important public health tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. Detection of protective antibodies and seroconversion after SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination can help guide patient care plans and public health policies. Serology tests can detect antibodies against past infections; consequently, they can help overcome the shortcomings of molecular tests, which can detect only active infections. This is important, especially when considering that many COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic. In this study, we describe an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based qualitative and quantitative serology test developed to measure IgG and IgA antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. The test can be deployed using commonly available laboratory reagents and equipment and displays high specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that IgG titers in patient samples can be estimated from a single measurement, enabling the assay's use in high-throughput clinical environments.","Bortz, Robert H; Florez, Catalina; Laudermilch, Ethan; Wirchnianski, Ariel S; Lasso, Gorka; Malonis, Ryan J; Georgiev, George I; Vergnolle, Olivia; Herrera, Natalia G; Morano, Nicholas C; Campbell, Sean T; Orner, Erika P; Mengotto, Amanda; Dieterle, M Eugenia; Fels, J Maximilian; Haslwanter, Denise; Jangra, Rohit K; Celikgil, Alev; Kimmel, Duncan; Lee, James H; Mariano, Margarette C; Nakouzi, Antonio; Quiroz, Jose; Rivera, Johanna; Szymczak, Wendy A; Tong, Karen; Barnhill, Jason; Forsell, Mattias N E; Ahlm, Clas; Stein, Daniel T; Pirofski, Liise-Anne; Goldstein, D Yitzchak; Garforth, Scott J; Almo, Steven C; Daily, Johanna P; Prystowsky, Michael B; Faix, James D; Fox, Amy S; Weiss, Louis M; Lai, Jonathan R; Chandran, Kartik",MSphere,389,1

According to a multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner Society, computed tomography (CT) is a relevant screening tool due to its higher sensitivity for detecting early pneumonic changes. However, physicians are extremely occupied fighting COVID-19 in this era of worldwide crisis. Thus, it is crucial to accelerate the development of an artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic tool to support physicians. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to rapidly develop an AI technique to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia in CT images and differentiate it from non-COVID-19 pneumonia and nonpneumonia diseases. METHODS: A simple 2D deep learning framework, named the fast-track COVID-19 classification network (FCONet), was developed to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia based on a single chest CT image. FCONet was developed by transfer learning using one of four state-of-the-art pretrained deep learning models (VGG16, ResNet-50, Inception-v3, or Xception) as a backbone. For training and testing of FCONet, we collected 3993 chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, other pneumonia, and nonpneumonia diseases from Wonkwang University Hospital, Chonnam National University Hospital, and the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology public database. These CT images were split into a training set and a testing set at a ratio of 8:2. For the testing data set, the diagnostic performance of the four pretrained FCONet models to diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia was compared. In addition, we tested the FCONet models on an external testing data set extracted from embedded low-quality chest CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia in recently published papers. RESULTS: Among the four pretrained models of FCONet, ResNet-50 showed excellent diagnostic performance (sensitivity 99.58%, specificity 100.00%, and accuracy 99.87%) and outperformed the other three pretrained models in the testing data set. In the additional external testing data set using low-quality CT images, the detection accuracy of the ResNet-50 model was the highest (96.97%), followed by Xception, Inception-v3, and VGG16 (90.71%, 89.38%, and 87.12%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: FCONet, a simple 2D deep learning framework based on a single chest CT image, provides excellent diagnostic performance in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia. Based on our testing data set, the FCONet model based on ResNet-50 appears to be the best model, as it outperformed other FCONet models based on VGG16, Xception, and Inception-v3.","Ko, Hoon; Chung, Heewon; Kang, Wu Seong; Kim, Kyung Won; Shin, Youngbin; Kang, Seung Ji; Lee, Jae Hoon; Kim, Young Jun; Kim, Nan Yeol; Jung, Hyunseok; Lee, Jinseok",J Med Internet Res,389,26

The future course of the disease includes severe respiratory infection and also leads to death if unattended. Meticulous measures are necessary before attending any patient. The dental operatories and the clinic surroundings must be well sanitized so as to prevent the spread of pandemic. Aim and objective: This review discusses in brief about the pathophysiology and course of COVID-19. Further, we discussed in detail the management aspects of patients in periodontal perspective and the sanitization procedures required for the dental clinic. Review results: The SARS coronavirus enters the human circulation via the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) receptors which are also found on the oral mucosal surfaces. Furin and Cathepsin L are the pro-inflammatory molecules released during pathogenesis of periodontitis and mediate the molecular pathways that help the virus invade into the host. The clinic set-up should be modified to best suit the pandemic conditions. This includes the three phases, i.e., phase I: preparatory phase;phase II: implementation phase;and phase III: follow-up. The patient management is explained based on the emergency needs of the patient based on the recent AAP classification of periodontal diseases and conditions 2017 as emergency, urgent, and elective treatment needs which have been explained in detail. Conclusion: It can be strongly concluded that there is direct relationship between oral health and systemic health. The treatment procedures and sanitization protocols must be definitely modified. Further consensus and systematic reviews help us arriving at a more standardized protocol.

During May and June, the gradual lift of the stringent measures resulted in the recovery of these reductions with pollution concentrations approaching the levels before the lockdown by the end of June 2020. In the second part, this work examines the alleged correlations between the reported cases of COVID-19 and temperature, humidity and particulate matter for March and April 2020 in Europe. It was found that decreasing temperatures and relative humidity with increasing concentrations of particulate matter are correlated with an increase in the number of reported cases during these 2 months. However, when these calculations were repeated for May and June, we found a remarkable drop in the significance of the correlations which leads us to question the generally accepted inverse relation between pandemics and air temperature at least during the warmer months. Such a relationship could not be supported in our study for SARS-CoV-2 virus and the question remains open. In the third and last part of this work, we examine the question referring to the origin of pandemics. In this context we have examined the hypothesis that the observed climate warming in Siberia and the Arctic and the thawing of permafrost could result to the release of trapped in the permafrost pathogens in the atmosphere. We find that although such relations cannot be directly justified, they present a possible horrifying mechanism for the origin of viruses in the future during the developing global warming of our planet in the decades to come. Overall the findings of our study indicate that: (1) the reduction of anthropogenic emissions in Europe during the ""anthropopause"" period of March and April 2020 was significant, but when the lockdown measures were raised the concentrations of atmospheric pollutants quickly recovered to pre-pandemic levels and therefore any possible climatic feedbacks were negligible; (2) no robust relationship between atmospheric parameters and the spread of COVID-19 cases can be justified in the warmer part of the year and (3) more research needs to be done regarding the possible links between climate change and the release of new pathogens from thawing of permafrost areas.","Zerefos, Christos S; Solomos, Stavros; Kapsomenakis, John; Poupkou, Anastasia; Dimitriadou, Lida; Polychroni, Iliana D; Kalabokas, Pavlos; Philandras, Constandinos M; Thanos, Dimitris",Environ Dev Sustain,389,24

The usual presentation is mild gastroenteritis, but systemic manifestations may occur. Lethal infections are rarely documented in patients with underlying disorders. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 37-year-old Southeast Asian woman presented to our hospital with recent onset of abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. Her condition rapidly deteriorated with signs and symptoms of fulminant septic shock; thus, she was intubated, supported with intravenous vasopressors and fluids, and transferred to the intensive care unit. An abdominal computed tomographic scan with contrast revealed multiple liver abscesses. Blood cultures were obtained and computed tomography-guided percutaneous drainage of the liver abscesses with supplementary cultures was performed; thereafter, empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated. All cultures grew E. tarda, whereas an antibiogram showed resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics and sensitivity to ciprofloxacin and aminoglycosides; thus, the antibiotic regimen was updated accordingly. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged from the intensive care unit 14 days after admission. CONCLUSION: E. tarda human infection can present as liver abscess and fulminant septic shock. E. tarda strains can be resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics; hence, culture-based antibiotics should be used accordingly. Clinicians should be aware of this rare and potentially lethal infection.","Bakirova, Gultakin Hasan; Alharthy, Abdulrahman; Corcione, Silvia; Aletreby, Waleed Tharwat; Mady, Ahmed Fouad; De Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe; Karakitsos, Dimitrios",J Med Case Rep,389,22

Health systems may be uniquely suited to support these workers given their medical expertise, and mobile apps can reach local communities despite social distancing requirements. Formal evaluation of real-world mobile app-based interventions is lacking. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the adoption, acceptability, and appropriateness of an academic medical center-sponsored app-based intervention (COVID-19 Guide App) designed to support access of first responders and essential workers to COVID-19 information and testing services. We also sought to better understand the COVID-19-related needs of these workers early in the pandemic. METHODS: To understand overall community adoption, views and download data of the COVID-19 Guide App were described. To understand the adoption, appropriateness, and acceptability of the app and the unmet needs of workers, semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted by telephone, by video, and in person with first responders and essential workers in the San Francisco Bay Area who were recruited through purposive, convenience, and snowball sampling. Interview transcripts and field notes were qualitatively analyzed and presented using an implementation outcomes framework. RESULTS: From its launch in April 2020 to September 2020, the app received 8262 views from unique devices and 6640 downloads (80.4% conversion rate, 0.61% adoption rate across the Bay Area). App acceptability was mixed among the 17 first responders interviewed and high among the 10 essential workers interviewed. Select themes included the need for personalized and accurate information, access to testing, and securing personal safety. First responders faced additional challenges related to interprofessional coordination and a ""culture of heroism"" that could both protect against and exacerbate health vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS: First responders and essential workers both reported challenges related to obtaining accurate information, testing services, and other resources. A mobile app intervention has the potential to combat these challenges through the provision of disease-specific information and access to testing services but may be most effective if delivered as part of a larger ecosystem of support. Differentiated interventions that acknowledge and address the divergent needs between first responders and non-first responder essential workers may optimize acceptance and adoption.","Vilendrer, Stacie; Amano, Alexis; Brown Johnson, Cati G; Favet, Marissa; Safaeinili, Nadia; Villasenor, Jacqueline; Shaw, Jonathan G; Hertelendy, Attila J; Asch, Steven M; Mahoney, Megan",J Med Internet Res,389,26

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the kynurenine pathway by transforming l-tryptophan (Trp) into l-kynurenine (Kyn), a metabolite endowed with anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory effects. In dendritic cells, IL-6 induces IDO1 proteasomal degradation and shuts down IDO1-mediated immunosuppressive effects. In tumor cells, IL-6 upregulates IDO1 expression and favors tumor immune escape mechanisms. To investigate the role of IDO1 and its possible relationship with IL-6 in obesity, we induced the disease by feeding mice with a high fat diet (HFD). Mice on a standard diet were used as control. Experimental obesity was associated with high IDO1 expression and Kyn levels in the stromal vascular fraction of visceral white adipose tissue (SVF WAT). IDO1-deficient mice on HFD gained less weight and were less insulin resistant as compared to wild type counterparts. Administration of tocilizumab (TCZ), an IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) antagonist, to mice on HFD significantly reduced weight gain, controlled adipose tissue hypertrophy, increased insulin sensitivity, and induced a better glucose tolerance. TCZ also induced a dramatic inhibition of IDO1 expression and Kyn production in the SVF WAT. Thus our data indicated that the IL-6/IDO1 axis may play a pathogenetic role in a chronic, low-grade inflammation condition, and, perhaps most importantly, IL-6R blockade may be considered a valid option for obesity treatment.","Mondanelli, Giada; Albini, Elisa; Orecchini, Elena; Pallotta, Maria Teresa; Belladonna, Maria Laura; Ricci, Giovanni; Grohmann, Ursula; Orabona, Ciriana",Front Immunol,389,16

However, comorbidity burden is often represented by a simple count of few conditions that may not fully capture patients complexity. PurposeTo evaluate the performance of a comprehensive index of the comorbidity burden (Queralt DxS), which includes all chronic conditions present on admission, as an adjustment variable in models for predicting critical illness in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and compare it with two broadly used measures of comorbidity. Patients and methodsWe analyzed data from all COVID-19 hospitalizations reported in eight public hospitals of Catalonia (North-East Spain) between June 15 and December 8 2020. The primary outcome was a composite of critical illness that included the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, transfer to ICU, or in-hospital death. Predictors included age, sex, and comorbidities present on admission measured using three indices: the Charlson index, the Elixhauser index, and the Queralt DxS index for comorbidities on admission. The performance of different fitted models was compared using various indicators, including the area under the receiving operating characteristics curve (AUC). ResultsOur analysis included 4,607 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Of them, 1,315 experienced critical illness. Comorbidities significantly contributed to predicting the outcome in all summary indices used. The AUC for prediction of critical illness was 0.641 (95% CI 0.624-0.660) for the Charlson index, 0.665 (0.645-0.681) for the Elixhauser index, and 0.787 (0.773-0.801) for Queralt DxS. Other metrics of model performance also showed Queralt DxS being consistently superior to the other indices. ConclusionIn our analysis, the ability of comorbidity indices to predict hospital outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients increased with their exhaustivity. The comprehensive Queralt DxS index may improve the accuracy of predictive models for resource allocation and clinical decision-making in the hospital setting.","Monterde, David; Carot-Sans, Gerard; Cainzos-Achirica, Miguel; Abilleira, Sònia; Coca, Marc; Vela, Emili; Clèries, Montse; Valero, Damià; Comin-Colet, Josep; Garcia-Eroles, Luis; Pérez-Sust, Pol; Arrufat, Miquel; Lejardi, Yolanda; Piera-Jiménez, Jordi",,389,24

General guidelines have evolved, but to date, there are no explicit directives about whether and how to proceed. This paper reviews professional, ethical, and legal challenges that experts should consider before conducting such an evaluation remotely. Although the discussion is more widely applicable, remote forensic psychological assessment of adults alleging childhood abuse is used as an example throughout, due to the complexity of these cases, the ethical dilemmas they can present, and the need to carefully assess non-verbal trauma-related symptoms. The use of videoconferencing technology is considered in terms of potential benefits of this medium, as well as challenges this method could pose to aspects of interviewing and psychometric testing. The global pandemic is also considered with respect to its effects on functioning and mental health and the confounding impact such a crisis has on assessing the relationship between childhood abuse and current psychological functioning.

METHODS: A 29-question survey was distributed to an international mailing list of patients with subglottic stenosis to assess the patient experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 543 patients with iSGS participated. Fewer than 1 in 10 patients with iSGS have experienced COVID-19 symptoms, which were predominantly mild to moderate, with only 2 hospitalizations. Most patients with iSGS (80.0%) have not been advised they are high risk for COVID-19, despite 36.5% of patients with iSGS being obese (body mass index of 30+). Delays to surgeries and in-office procedures have impacted 40.1% of patients currently receiving treatment, with 38.8% of patients increasingly struggling to breathe as a result. Anxiety and stress are increasing among patients, with 3 in 4 (75.2%) reporting they are anxious about travelling by public transport, contracting the virus in hospital and infecting loved ones (69.0% and 71.9%, respectively). Of greater concern is that 23.1% with increasing dyspnea state they are staying away from hospital despite their deteriorating health. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the physical and psychological health of patients with iSGS. Surgeons managing cases of laryngotracheal stenosis need to offer appropriate support and communication to these high risk patients. During the pandemic, this should include self-isolation if they are dyspneic or on treatments that may have reduced their immunity. In addition, they should offer safe clinical pathways to airway assessment and treatments, if they become necessary. To minimize unnecessary travel, much of the clinical monitoring can be carried out remotely, using telephone or video-based consultations, in conjunction with local health professionals.","Anderson, Catherine; Sandhu, Guri; Yaghchi, Chadwan Al",Ear Nose Throat J,389,23

Much fentanyl was produced in Wuhan, China, the source of the epidemic. Fentanyl was previously sold directly to American consumers through online websites and was also supplied by Mexican drug traffickers, who produced the drug from precursor chemicals purchased from China. With the advent of the pandemic, websites from Wuhan-based sellers reported that the drugs were not being produced or shipped. Moreover, Mexican drug traffickers were deprived of the precursor chemicals to produce this highly potent opioid. Despite the reduced entry of illicit fentanyl to the United States, enough was stockpiled by drug traffickers perpetuating a very serious problem of illegal fentanyl abuse. Deaths have increased since the start of the COVID epidemic, as the problems of drug abuse have not stopped and access to treatment and medical services are diminished. Moreover, isolation and lack of social support compound the problem. The initial data on increased deaths from illegal fentanyl consumption are consistent with the overall picture of the impact of the COVID epidemic.

METHODS: Students were emailed an electronic survey during their first semester and annually at the end of each academic year for a total of 3 years (2017-2020). Validated survey tools included the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) student version. The JSE survey consists of 20 questions, with higher scores denoting more empathy. The MBI student version contains 3 subscales: exhaustion (higher scores are worse), cynicism (higher scores are worse) and professional efficacy (higher scores are better). RESULTS: The median JSE score at the end of the third academic year (PY3) was 110, with females scoring significantly higher (114.5 vs. 103.5; p<0.02). A majority of the 62 students reported burn out (82.3%), scoring in the highest category for either exhaustion (76%) or cynicism (55%). A majority (66%) also reported a low or moderate professional efficacy score, a negative finding. Measures of student burnout increased after the start of the program and remained at the higher level each subsequent year (p<0.0001). In the Spring of 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly every student had moderate or high levels of emotional exhaustion (97%) and cynicism (78%) as measured by the MBI.

METHODS: We estimated age and sex-specific excess mortality risk and deaths above a baseline adjusted for seasonality with a systematic comparison of four different models using data from the Office for National Statistics. We additionally provide estimates of life expectancy at birth and lifespan inequality defined as the SD in age at death. RESULTS: There have been 57 419 (95% prediction interval: 54 197, 60 752) excess deaths in the first 47 weeks of 2020, 55% of which occurred in men.

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study. Secondary data was used to define the exposure (multidimensional poverty level) and outcome (survival time) among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 between 27 February and 1 July 2020. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) from Cox regression were computed. RESULTS: Nearly 250 000 COVID-19 patients were included. Mortality was 12.3% reaching 59.3% in patients with &#8805;1 comorbidities. Multivariate survival analyses revealed that individuals living in municipalities with extreme poverty had 9% higher risk of dying at any given time proportionally to those living in municipalities classified as not poor (HR 1.09; 95% CI 1.06-1.12). The survival gap widened with the follow-up time up to the third to fourth weeks after diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests that the poorest population groups have a lower survival from COVID-19. Thus, combating extreme poverty should be a central preventive strategy.","Millán-Guerrero, Rebeca Olivia; Caballero-Hoyos, Ramiro; Monárrez-Espino, Joel",J. public health (Oxf),389,20

Medicinal oxygen is the primary treatment administrated to the majority of patients suffering from respiratory problems and low levels of oxygen in the blood, and in the context of the actual health crisis caused by the new COVID-19, the challenge is represented by increasing the supply of medicinal oxygen while reducing cost so that it is accessible where it is needed most, free at the point of use. It will take increased investment and commitment to put oxygen at the center of strategies for universal health coverage. In this context, it becomes essential to investigate the main characteristics of the Romanian market of medicinal oxygen, highlighting top key players, market development, key driving factors, types of products, market perspectives as well as shedding light on the segmentation of this particular market based on considerations regarding regions, hospital competence class and hospital specialization. Also, the research aims to explore the regional disparities in the decision of using O93%medicinal oxygen, revealing the main factors related to the usage of this type of product among Romanian public hospitals. The research relies on the first quantitative survey regarding medicinal oxygen usage among 121 public hospital units from a total of 461 public hospitals in 2018, which meet the specific requirements: includes the entire population according to the list published on the website of the Ministry of Health, is the most recent data and does not show repetition. The sampling was of probabilistic stage-type stratification, with the following sampling layers: hospital county distribution, hospital competence class officially assigned by the Ministry of Health and also area of residence (urban/rural). In order to analyze the main characteristics of the Romanian oxygen market, the following methods have been used: analysis of variance (ANOVA) together with Kruskal-Wallis, Pearson correlation coefficient as well as Goodman and Kruskal gamma, Kendall's tau-b and Cramer's V, as well as multilevel logistic regression analysis using hierarchical data (hospitals grouped in regions). The Romanian market of medicinal oxygen is rather an oligopoly market characterized by the existence of a small number of producers and two types of products currently used for the same medical purpose and having a substitutable character: medicinal oxygen O99.5%, and medicinal oxygen O93%. An overwhelming proportion of public hospitals agree that both types of medicinal oxygen serve the same therapeutic purpose. The Romanian market of medicinal oxygen highlighted a significant segmentation on considerations based on regions, hospital competence class and hospital specialization. Regarding the main perspectives, the Romanian market of medical oxygen keeps the growth trend registered globally, with development perspectives for competitors. Exploring the regional disparities in the decision of using O93 medicinal oxygen, the empirical results acknowledged the important role of unitary price, hospital capacity and the relevance of this product seen as a medicine. Medicinal oxygen is vital in sustaining life, proving its utility mainly in the context of the actual health crisis. In this context, the Romanian local market exhibits prospects for further development, being characterized by an important segmentation depending on regions, hospital competence class and hospital specialization.","Davidescu, Adriana AnaMaria; Apostu, Simona Andreea; Stanciu-Mandruleanu, Cristina",,389,12

With the new ordinances of the Ministry of Education and Health, all courses can use remote methodologies for the continuity on the current school year. With new challenges and paradigms emerging from this methodological proposal: provide for the user the feeling of immersion, of being in the class room, from the navigation and interaction in this virtual environment, at the same time that the educator, respecting the educational principles and the pedagogical approach that he believes, does not transform this moment into a simple distance educationOBJECTIVE: To describe the state of the art on nursing education and the challenges of using remote technologies in the time of Corona virus pandemicMETHODS: This is a reflective study based on secondary sources of literature relevant to the theme, considering articles from national and international journals and recent productions on education, health training, remote technologies, COVId-19 and public healthRESULTS: It is evident that experiencing the effects of the corona virus pandemic (COVID-19) in the health educational sector, especially in the field of nursing, goes beyond a structural reorganization of courses. It implies change attitude of managers, teachers and students to reformulate educational practices (sometimes with traditional tools), with innovative practices preserving a methodology that provides to the student criticality reflection, dialogue, bonding and interaction; elements that are part of a training aimed at transformation, empowerment and not just the transmission of knowledge. In this context, the COVID-19 pandemic caused paradigm shifts perhaps not yet overcome by health science institutions , because when they perceived themselves within a reality that generated changes in the political, economic, cultural and social aspects at a global level, they had to reinvent and insert new ways of teaching in their work process; they had to discuss different educational approaches and, given the needs to readjust health teaching methods, they inserted remote technologies as essential tools to meet the real need for continuity of classes in non-face-to-face model. For many, it is a challenge, as it currently permeates a reflection on the attention of distance learning in the field of nursing and other courses in the health area. However, as it opened up to discussions about new ways of teaching mediated by innovation, it can be said that this will be one of the greatest impact of the pandemic in benefit the education: the contribution of new information and communication technologies in the teaching-learning process for training in health, as well as the reflection on distance education and its concepts, differentiating it from the concepts of remote methodology and the use of technologiesCONCLUSION: In nursing education, the discussion related to the use of remote technologies in the classroom has always been a point of debate. However, with the need to include these tools for the continuity of classes in the non-face-to-face model resulting from the social isolation strategy motivated by the pandemic of COVID-19, it can provide an opportunity to have a new look on the subject and perhaps there is an opportunity to expand the debate on the use of remote methodologies in health education, seeking a reflection on their interaction with the other teaching methods already implemented","Bezerra, Italla Maria Pinheiro",Rev. bras. crescimento desenvolv. hum,389,1

Consequently, specific operational guidelines were promptly released, and containment measures were quickly implemented in prisons. This paper aims to describe the spread of COVID-19 in detention facilities within the Lombardy region of Italy during March to July 2020, and the impact of the prevention and control measures implemented. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A descriptive retrospective analysis of case distribution was performed for all COVID-19 cases identified among people in detention (PiD) and prison officers (POs). A comparison of the epidemic burden affecting different populations and a correlation analysis between the number of cases that occurred and prevention measures implemented were also carried out. FINDINGS: From this study, it emerged that POs were at a high risk of contracting COVID-19. This study observed a delay in the occurrence of cases among PiD and substantial heterogeneity in the size of outbreaks across different prisons. Correlation between reported cases among PiD and registered sick leave taken by POs suggested the latter contributed to introducing the infection into prison settings. Finally, number of cases among PiD inversely correlated with the capacity of each prison to identify and set up dedicated areas for medical isolation. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Prevention and control measures when adopted in a timely manner were effective in protecting PiD. According to the findings, POs are a population at high risk for acquiring and transmitting COVID-19 and should be prioritized for testing, active case finding and vaccination. This study highlights the critical importance of including prison settings within emergency preparedness plans.","Giuliani, Ruggero; Mazzilli, Sara; Sebastiani, Teresa; Cocca, Giorgia; Bortolotti, Raffaella; Cairone, Cristina; Scardina, Giuditta; Arzilli, Guglielmo; Tavoschi, Lara; Ranieri, Roberto",International journal of prisoner health (Online),389,1

In India, the pandemic precipitated a severe 'crisis of mobility', with migrant labourers in many major cities seeking to return to their hometowns. Their desperate attempts to return home by any means available rendered the lockdown ineffective in several areas, prompting clashes with authorities, last-minute policy relief and, eventually, the arrangement of transport measures. This paper aims to shed light on the vulnerability of India's internal migrants in terms of their mobility, gender and mental health.

The antibody response in infected patients remains largely unknown, and the clinical value of antibody testing has not been fully demonstrated. METHODS: 173 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma samples (nâ =â 535) collected during hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab), IgM, and IgG against SARS-CoV-2. The dynamics of antibodies with disease progress were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 173 patients, the seroconversion rates for Ab, IgM, and IgG were 93.1%, 82.7%, and 64.7%, respectively. The reason for the negative antibody findings in 12 patients might be due to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness. The median seroconversion times for Ab, IgM, and then IgG were days 11, 12, and 4, respectively. The presence of antibodies wasâ <40% among patients within 1 week of onset, and rapidly increased to 100.0% (Ab), 94.3% (IgM), and 79.8% (IgG) by day 15 after onset. In contrast, RNA detectability decreased from 66.7% (58/87) in samples collected before day 7 to 45.5% (25/55) during days 15-39. Combining RNA and antibody detection significantly improved the sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID-19 (Pâ <â .001), even in the early phase of 1 week from onset (Pâ =â .007). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a worse clinical classification (Pâ =â .006). CONCLUSIONS: Antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 patients.","Zhao, Juanjuan; Yuan, Quan; Wang, Haiyan; Liu, Wei; Liao, Xuejiao; Su, Yingying; Wang, Xin; Yuan, Jing; Li, Tingdong; Li, Jinxiu; Qian, Shen; Hong, Congming; Wang, Fuxiang; Liu, Yingxia; Wang, Zhaoqin; He, Qing; Li, Zhiyong; He, Bin; Zhang, Tianying; Fu, Yang; Ge, Shengxiang; Liu, Lei; Zhang, Jun; Xia, Ningshao; Zhang, Zheng",Clin Infect Dis,389,5

Singapore adopted a multipronged surveillance strategy that included applying the case definition at medical consults, tracing contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, enhancing surveillance among different patient groups (all patients with pneumonia, hospitalized patients in intensive care units [ICUs] with possible infectious diseases, primary care patients with influenza-like illness, and deaths from possible infectious etiologies), and allowing clinician discretion (i.e., option to order a test based on clinical suspicion, even if the case definition was not met) to identify COVID-19 patients. Containment measures, including patient isolation and quarantine, active monitoring of contacts, border controls, and community education and precautions, were performed to minimize disease spread. As of March 5, 2020, a total of 117 COVID-19 cases had been identified in Singapore. This report analyzes the first 100 COVID-19 patients in Singapore to determine the effectiveness of the surveillance and containment measures. COVID-19 patients were classified by the primary means by which they were detected. Application of the case definition and contact tracing identified 73 patients, 16 were detected by enhanced surveillance, and 11 were identified by laboratory testing based on providers' clinical discretion. Effectiveness of these measures was assessed by calculating the 7-day moving average of the interval from symptom onset to isolation in hospital or quarantine, which indicated significant decreasing trends for both local and imported COVID-19 cases.

However, limited research is known about the relationship between these two types of purchases within the broader context of negative emotion. Specifically, the current research focuses on the effect of experiential purchases on loneliness alleviation to replenish this research stream. Three experiments were conducted to explore the effect of experiential purchases (vs. material purchases) on alleviating loneliness. The results showed that experiential purchases have a stronger effect on loneliness alleviation than material purchases, which is mediated by relationship enhancement. In addition, purchases of social nature moderate the effect of experiential purchases on loneliness. Social experiential purchases lead to a higher degree of relief of loneliness. On the contrary, for the solitary experiential purchases, the effect of experiential purchases on loneliness is less tight. The current research supplements the research on negative emotions of experiential purchases and expands the research area of experiential purchases, which also provides new insights into coping strategies of loneliness.","Yang, Bingcheng; Yu, Hongyan; Yu, Yu",Front Psychol,389,1

Material and Method. HUVECs were incubated with high glucose (33.3 mmol/L) for 48 hours to induce injury, and cells were treated with PDC (100, 200, and 400 μg/mL) for 48 hours. The tetrazolium blue colorimetric (MTT) assay was used to detect cell proliferation, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and nitric oxide (NO) content in cell supernatants. Flow cytometry was used to detect reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium levels. RESULTS: (1) Compared with the control group, the proliferation of HUVECs cells in the high glucose (33.3 mmol/L) group decreased (P < 0.05). The intracellular calcium ion concentration and the intracellular ROS level increased (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05). SOD activity and the level of NO in the culture medium were reduced (P <0.05). (2) Compared with the control group, PDC (50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 μg/mL) did not significantly affect the cell proliferation of HUVECs (P > 0.05). (3) Compared with the high glucose group, the HUVEC cell viability of the high glucose + PDC (100, 200, and 400 μg/mL) group increased while the intracellular calcium ion concentration decreased in a concentration-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Intracellular ROS levels were reduced, while SOD activity and the level of NO in culture fluids increased (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: PDC can promote the proliferation of HUVECs in the high glucose environment by reducing oxidative stress injury of HUVECs induced by high glucose.","Li, Yajia; Cao, Ziqin; Jia, Limin; Huang, Yanfei; Shi, Meilan; Li, Qiangxiang",J Diabetes Res,389,3

In the past, the administration of convalescent plasma of patients having recovered from SARS and severe influenza to patients actively having the disease showed promising effects on mortality and appeared safe. Whether or not this also holds true for the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently unknown. METHODS: DAWn-Plasma is a multicentre nation-wide, randomized, open-label, phase II proof-of-concept clinical trial, evaluating the clinical efficacy and safety of the addition of convalescent plasma to the standard of care in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in Belgium. Patients hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 are eligible when they are symptomatic (i.e. clinical or radiological signs) and have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the 72 h before study inclusion through a PCR (nasal/nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage) or a chest-CT scan showing features compatible with COVID-19 in the absence of an alternative diagnosis. Patients are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either standard of care and convalescent plasma (active treatment group) or standard of care only. The active treatment group receives 2 units of 200 to 250 mL of convalescent plasma within 12 h after randomization, with a second administration of 2 units 24 to 36 h after ending the first administration. The trial aims to include 483 patients and will recruit from 25 centres across Belgium. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients that require mechanical ventilation or have died at day 15. The main secondary endpoints are clinical status on day 15 and day 30 after randomization, as defined by the WHO Progression 10-point ordinal scale, and safety of the administration of convalescent plasma. DISCUSSION: This trial will either provide support or discourage the use of convalescent plasma as an early intervention for the treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection.

Telemedicine was incorporated into clinical workflows and much preventive care, including Hepatitis C (HCV) testing, was not routinely performed. OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact that the COVID-19 rapid restructuring response has had on HCV testing and identification hospital-wide and in ambulatory settings. METHODS: BMC utilizes reflex confirmatory testing for HCV. When a sample is HCV Ab positive, it is automatically reflexed for confirmatory RNA and genotype testing. HCV test results for patients were collected daily. We compared unique patient tests for 3.5 month periods before and after March 16th, 2020. Descriptive statistics showed total tests and total new HCV RNA+ before versus after, both hospital-wide and in ambulatory clinics alone. Mean daily tests completed were compared. RESULTS: Hospital-wide, total HCV testing decreased by 49.6%, and new HCV+ patient identification decreased by 42.1%. In ambulatory clinics, testing decreased by 71.9%, and new HCV+ identification decreased by 63.3%. Hospital-wide, mean daily tests decreased by 22.9 tests per day (95% CI: 17.9-28.0, P < .001), and mean daily new HCV+ identification decreased by 0.36 (95% CI: 0.20-0.53, P < .001). In ambulatory clinics, mean daily tests decreased by 22.1 tests per day (95% CI: 17.5-26.7, P < .001) and mean daily HCV+ decreased by 1.40 (95% CI: 1.03-1.76, P < .001). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 systematic emergency response led to decreased HCV testing and identification, and in this regard telemedicine acts as a barrier to HCV care. Other public health initiatives must be monitored in the context of telemedicine workflows. Continued monitoring of HCV screening trends is vital, and adaptive approaches to work toward the goal of HCV elimination are needed.","Sperring, Heather; Ruiz-Mercado, Glorimar; Schechter-Perkins, Elissa M.",J Prim Care Community Health,389,20

Our aim was to develop a simple, inexpensive and ecological method for decontamination of disposable FFPs that preserves filtration efficiency and material integrity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Contamination of FFPs (3M Aura 9320+) with SARS-CoV-2 (1.15â¯×â¯104 PFUs), Enterococcus faecium (>106 CFUs), and physiological nasopharyngeal flora was performed prior to decontamination by submersion in a solution of 6 % acetic acid and 6 % hydrogen peroxide (6%AA/6%HP solution) over 30 minutes. Material integrity was assessed by testing the filtering efficiency, loss of fit and employing electron microscopy. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Decontamination with the 6%AA/6%HP solution resulted in the complete elimination of SARS-CoV-2, E. faecium and physiological nasopharyngeal flora. Material characterization post-treatment showed neither critical material degradation, loss of fit or reduction of filtration efficiency. Electron microscopy revealed no damage to the fibers, and the rubber bands' elasticity was not affected by the decontamination procedure. No concerning residuals of the decontamination procedure were found. CONCLUSION: The simple application and widespread availability of 6%AA/6%HP solution for decontaminating disposable FFPs make this solution globally viable, including developing and third world countries.","Boeing, Christian; Sandten, Christian; Hrincius, Dr Eike R; Anhlan, Dr Darisuren; Dworog, Dr Andreas; Hanning, Stephanie; Kuennemann, Thilo; Niehues, Prof Dr Christopher; Schupp, Prof Dr Thomas; Stec, Dr Edyta; Thume, Julius; Triphaus, Daniel; Wilkens, Dr Markus; Uphoff, Dipl Ing Holger; Zuendorf, Dr Josef; Jacobshagen, Dr Anja; Kreyenschmidt, Prof Dr Martin; Ludwig, Prof Dr Stephan; Mertins, Prof Dr Hans-Christoph; Mellmann, Prof Dr Alexander",Am. j. infect. control,389,24

The proposed approach, denominated “Commitment Machine” (CM), has a strong focus on assets cross-correlation and allows to measure adaptively the ES, dynamically evaluating which is the most performing method through the minimization of a loss function. The CM algorithm compares four different ES estimation techniques which all take into account the interaction effects among assets: a Bayesian Vector autoregressive model, Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) numerical schemes with Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), a Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) volatility model and a hybrid method that integrates Dynamic Recurrent Neural Networks together with a Monte Carlo approach. The integration of traditional Monte Carlo approaches with Machine Learning technologies and the heterogeneity of dynamically selected methodologies lead to an improved estimation of the ES. The study describes the techniques adopted by the CM and the logic behind model selection; moreover, it provides a market application case of the proposed metaheuristic, by simulating an equally weighted multi-asset portfolio.","Bagnato, Marco; Bottasso, Anna; Giribone, Pier Giuseppe",Front Artif Intell,389,16

We aimed to establish whether baseline serum 25(OH)D concentration was associated with COVID-19 mortality, and inpatient confirmed COVID-19 infection, in UK Biobank participants. METHODS: UK Biobank recruited 502,624 participants aged 37–73 years between 2006 and 2010. Baseline exposure data, including serum 25(OH)D concentration, were linked to COVID-19 mortality. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed for the association between 25(OH)D and COVID-19 death, and Poisson regression analyses for the association between 25(OH)D and severe COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: Complete data were available for 341,484 UK Biobank participants, of which 656 had inpatient confirmed COVID-19 infection and 203 died of COVID-19 infection. 25(OH)D concentration was associated with severe COVID-19 infection and mortality univariably (mortality per 10 nmol/L 25(OH)D HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.86–0.98; p = 0.016), but not after adjustment for confounders (mortality per 10 nmol/L 25(OH)D HR 0.98; 95% CI = 0.91–1.06; p = 0.696). Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency was also not independently associated with either COVID-19 infection or linked mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support a potential link between 25(OH)D concentrations and risk of severe COVID-19 infection and mortality. Randomised trials are needed to prove a beneficial role for vitamin D in the prevention of severe COVID-19 reactions or death.","Hastie, Claire E.; Pell, Jill P.; Sattar, Naveed",Eur J Nutr,389,30

Epidemiologic, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were analyzed. Results: The average age of the 28 patients was 68.6 ± 9.0 years. Most (75%) patients were male. Only 39.3% of the patients had a clear exposure of COVID-19. Fever (92.9%), dry cough (82.1%), and fatigue (64.3%) were the most common symptoms, followed by dyspnea (57.1%), anorexia (57.1%), diarrhea (42.9%), expectoration (25.0%), and nausea (21.4%).

Contrary to explicit factors that are measurable, such as population density, number of medical staff, and the daily test rate, many factors are not directly observable, for instance, culture differences and attitudes toward the disease, which may introduce unobserved heterogeneity. Most contemporary COVID‐19 related research has focused on modeling the relationship between explicitly measurable factors and the response variable of interest (such as the infection rate or the death rate). The infection rate is a commonly used metric for evaluating disease progression and a state's mitigation efforts. Because unobservable sources of heterogeneity cannot be measured directly, it is hard to incorporate them into the quantitative assessment and decision‐making process. In this study, we propose new metrics to study a state's performance by adjusting the measurable county‐level covariates and unobservable state‐level heterogeneity through random effects. A hierarchical linear model (HLM) is postulated, and we calculate two model‐based metrics—the standardized infection ratio (SDIR) and the adjusted infection rate (AIR). This analysis highlights certain time periods when the infection rate for a state was high while their SDIR was low and vice versa. We show that trends in these metrics can give insight into certain aspects of a state's performance. As each state continues to develop their individualized COVID‐19 mitigation strategy and ultimately works to improve their performance, the SDIR and AIR may help supplement the crude infection rate metric to provide a more thorough understanding of a state's performance.","Li, Yun; Rice, Megan; Li, Moming; Du, Chengan; Xin, Xin; Wang, Zifu; Shi, Xun; Yang, Chaowei",Geohealth,389,20

A mild fever appears to improve outcome; it appears to diminish viral replication by several mechanisms, including virion entry into host cells and genome transcription, and improving host defence mechanisms against the pathogen. However, a fever may also damage host cellular and tissue function and increase metabolic demands. At temperatures at the lower end of the febrile range, the benefit of the fever appears to outweigh the detrimental effects. However, at higher temperatures, the outcome worsens, suggesting that the disadvantages of fever on the host predominate. A non-infective fever is associated with a worse outcome at lower temperatures, suggesting that hyperthermia carries less benefit in the absence of infection. This review discusses the risks and benefits of a fever on the host response, focusing on the effects of a fever on viral replication and host response, and the detrimental effect on the host.","Belon, Lucas; Skidmore, Peter; Mehra, Rohan; Walter, Edward",World J Clin Cases,389,1

Moreover, in the latter system, nucleolar presence of ZIKV capsid protein (ZIKV-C) was associated with ribosomal stress and apoptosis. Deletion of 22 C-terminal residues of ZIKV-C prevented nucleolar localization, ribosomal stress and apoptosis. Consistent with a casual relationship between ZIKV-C-induced ribosomal stress and apoptosis, ZIKV-C-overexpressing neurons were protected by loss-of-function manipulations targeting the ribosomal stress effector Tp53 or knockdown of the ribosomal stress mediator RPL11. Finally, capsid protein of Dengue virus, but not West Nile virus, induced ribosomal stress and apoptosis. Thus, anti-nucleolar and pro-apoptotic effects of protein C are flavivirus-species specific. In the case of ZIKV, capsid protein-mediated ribosomal stress may contribute to neuronal death, neurodevelopmental disruption and microcephaly.","Slomnicki, Lukasz P.; Chung, Dong-Hoon; Parker, Austin; Hermann, Taylor; Boyd, Nolan L.; Hetman, Michal",Sci Rep,389,24

In this context, established research identified pregnant women as a susceptible group of SARS-CoV-2 infection, although there is still limited data regarding the real impact of COVID-19 in this group. With that purpose, we conducted a systematic review describing the maternal-fetal results of pregnant women infected by SARS-CoV-2, in aim to analyze the profile of the obstetric patients according to the country of origin of the publication. A total of 38 articles were included in this systematic review with 2670 patients from 7 countries, with 20 works published from China (52.6%). We reported significative differences according to the median maternal age, with Spain as the country with the highest age (34.6 years); The percentage of tabaquism; proportion of symptomatic patients in the triage; type of radiological exam (China and France conduct CT scans on all their patients in comparison to the use of chest X-Ray in the rest of the countries studied); percentages of C-sections (83.9% in China; 35.9% Spain, p < 0.001); maternal mortality rate, proportion of patients who need treatments, the use of antivirals, antibiotics, and anticoagulants as well as measurements of the newborns. Perinatal results are favorable in the majority of countries, with very low rates of vertical transmission in the majority of works. The studies collected in this review showed moderate to high index of quality. The different works describe the affectation during the first wave of the pandemic, where the pregnant woman with SARS-CoV-2 infection is generally symptomatic during the third trimester of gestation along with other factors associated with worse prognosis of the disease, such as higher age, body mass index, and further comorbidities developed during pregnancy. In the obstetric patient, proportion of C-sections are elevated together with prematurity, increasing maternal perinatal morbimortality. Differences found between countries could be based on the proper profile of the patient in each region, the period of the pandemic directly affecting how it was managed, and the variations regarding in situ medical attention.","Cuñarro-López, Yolanda; Pintado-Recarte, Pilar; Cueto-Hernández, Ignacio; Hernández-Martín, Concepción; Payá-Martínez, María Pilar; Muñóz-Chápuli, María del Mar; Cano-Valderrama, Óscar; Bravo, Coral; Bujan, Julia; Álvarez-Mon, Melchor; Ortega, Miguel A.; De León-Luis, Juan Antonio",J Clin Med,389,1

Anthropogenic aerosols (and their precursors) that cause solar dimming are in fact often co‐emitted with GHGs. While the reduction of GHG emissions is expected to slow down the ongoing increase in the greenhouse effect, an increased surface irradiance due to reduced atmospheric aerosol load might occur in the most populated areas of the earth. Increased irradiance may lead to air warming, favour the occurrence of heatwaves and increase the evaporative demand of the atmosphere. This is why effective and sustainable solar radiation management strategies to reflect more light back to space should be designed, tested and implemented together with GHG emission mitigation. Here we propose that new plants (crops, orchards and forests) with low‐chlorophyll (Chl) content may provide a realistic, sustainable and relatively simple solution to increase surface reflectance of large geographical areas via changes in surface albedo. This may finally offset all or part of the expected local solar brightening. While high‐Chl content provides substantial competitive advantages to plants growing in their natural environment, new plants with low‐Chl content may be successfully used in agriculture and silviculture and be as productive as the green wildtypes (or even more). The most appropriate strategies to obtain highly productive and highly reflective plants are discussed in this paper and their mitigation potential is examined together with the challenges associated with their introduction in agriculture.","Genesio, Lorenzo; Bassi, Roberto; Miglietta, Franco",Glob Chang Biol,389,17

One of its after-effects is post-COVID depression, which, according to the latest data, affects up to 40% of people who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection. A very important issue for the mental health of the general population is to look for the causes of this complication and its biomarkers. This will help in faster diagnosis and effective treatment of the affected patients. In our work, we focused on the search for major depressive disorder (MDD) biomarkers, which are also present in COVID-19 patients and may influence the development of post-COVID depression. For this purpose, we searched PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar scientific literature databases using keywords such as ‘COVID-19’, ‘SARS-CoV-2’, ‘depression’, ‘post-COVID’, ‘biomarkers’ and others. Among the biomarkers found, the most important that were frequently described are increased levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), soluble interleukin 6 receptor (sIL-6R), interleukin 1 β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin 10 (IL-10), interleukin 2 (IL-2), soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2R), C-reactive protein (CRP), Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), serum amyloid a (SAA1) and metabolites of the kynurenine pathway, as well as decreased brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tryptophan (TRP).

However, textual radiological reports also contain relevant information for determining the likelihood of presenting radiological signs of COVID-19 involving lungs. The development of COVID-19 automatic detection systems based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques could provide a great help in supporting clinicians and detecting COVID-19 related disorders within radiological reports. In this paper we propose a text classification system based on the integration of different information sources. The system can be used to automatically predict whether or not a patient has radiological findings consistent with COVID-19 on the basis of radiological reports of chest CT. To carry out our experiments we use 295 radiological reports from chest CT studies provided by the ‘‘HT médica"" clinic. All of them are radiological requests with suspicions of chest involvement by COVID-19. In order to train our text classification system we apply Machine Learning approaches and Named Entity Recognition. The system takes two sources of information as input: the text of the radiological report and COVID-19 related disorders extracted from SNOMED-CT. The best system is trained using SVM and the baseline results achieve 85% accuracy predicting lung involvement by COVID-19, which already offers competitive values that are difficult to overcome. Moreover, we apply mutual information in order to integrate the best quality information extracted from SNOMED-CT. In this way, we achieve around 90% accuracy improving the baseline results by 5 points.","López-Úbeda, Pilar; Díaz-Galiano, Manuel Carlos; Martín-Noguerol, Teodoro; Luna, Antonio; Ureña-López, L.

Few data are available about the risk of COVID-19 infection in persons with hematological cancer, but controversy whether these persons have the same clinical signs and outcomes. We describe a case of life‐threatening COVID-19 infection complicated by severe anemia in patients affected also by chronic myelogenous leukemia. The screening for RBC antibodies and the direct antiglobulin test (DAT) turned positive. The identification of the antibodies, showed the presence of an alloantibody with anti-Lewis b specificity, which was reactive at room temperature, in the anti-human globulin phase (AGH) and with papain-treated red blood cells. At the same time hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), on the basis of major laboratory findings including hyperferritnemia, increase of triglicerides levels and according to the HLH score was suspected. Patients received antiviral therapy, steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins. Hemolysis resolved and ferritin dramatically decreased after administration of Ig and a Afull recovery was achieved after viral infection resolution.This case highlights the novel and multifaceted hematological findings during sever COVID 19 infection. COVID 19-related pneumonia is mediated by hyper activation of effector T cells and excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1, interferon-gamma, and TNF. This inflammatory process called ""cytokine storm"" is a life-threatening complication of COVID 19 infection. In this case severe immunohematological consequences are reported for the first time and recognition of this complications are probably underestimated.","Sora, Federica; Chiusolo, Patrizia; Laurenti, Luca; Innocenti, Idanna; Autore, Francesco; Alma, Eleonora; Viscovo, Marcello; Fusco, Domernico; Maresca, Maddalena; Tumbarello, Mario; Sica, Simona",Transfus Apher Sci,389,11

This allowed to continue work activities and services and contributed to contain the risk of infection in different sectors, particularly in the public administration. OBJECTIVES: This follow up study focussed on a panel of 187 workers from the Italian Workers’ Compensation Authority taking part to a pilot project “Smart Working in INAIL” from January 2019 to December 2019. The aim was to investigate the effects of work organization on work attitudes, work-life balance and health outcomes before and after the introduction of the smart working. METHODS: The data were collected at two time points through a web-based questionnaire. The first wave aimed to collect information up to one month before the implementation of the smart working. The second wave aimed to collect information about potential changes occurred after one year of smart working. RESULTS: This study showed that high demands, low control and low social support might lead to reduced well-being and less satisfaction with work, and have an effect on work engagement and work-life balance. Particularly, improving social support can moderate the negative impact of high strain on well-being, preventing work-life imbalance and risk of isolation. DISCUSSION: Findings and future perspectives are discussed to support stakeholders in defining policies and practices concerning health and wellbeing at work while preserving productivity, for a successful implementation of smart working in the public administration.","Di Tecco, Cristina; Ronchetti, Matteo; Russo, Simone; Ghelli, Monica; Rondinone, Bruna Maria; Persechino, Benedetta; Iavicoli, Sergio",Med Lav,389,24

DESIGN: A Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA) was conducted by a multidisciplinary IVF team. A schematic representation of new protocols and procedures adopted during COVID-19 emergency has been defined, including directives about the behavior to adopt when entering the clinic and the laboratory, in case of face-to-face contact with patients and between staff members. Lastly, the risk of cross-contamination between samples belonging to different patients during cell handling and manipulation has been also evaluated. Potential failure modes for each phase have been analyzed, focusing on possible sources of error. Risk priority numbers have been calculated as products of Occurrence x Severity x Detection scores. RESULTS: Except for cell-cell contamination, which has been considered highly unlikely, failure modes during Patient-Staff, Staff-Staff and Staff-Cell interactions were estimated at moderate-high risk of infection. The main corrective measures entailed precautionary logistic measures, the implementation of additional personal protective equipment (PPE), and changes in setting the IVF laboratory and scheduling the daily routine. Some IVF procedures were also revised mainly aiming at increasing staff's awareness and caution during pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Standard IVF laboratory protocols are insufficient to face a virus whose transmission is aerosol-mediated. The measures outlined in this FMEA should thus be considered not only facing this pandemic but also for the future to be able to manage promptly any aerosol-mediated virus infection, whose impact on the management of an IVF laboratory might be less severe than COVID-19 although not completely negligible (i.e. staff reduction and patient health at the time of IVF procedure).","Maggiulli, Roberta; Giancani, Adriano; Fabozzi, Gemma; Dovere, Lisa; Tacconi, Luisa; Amendola, Mariagiulia; Cimadomo, Danilo; Ubaldi, Filippo Maria; Rienzi, Laura",Reprod Biomed Online,389,20

We posit that the favorable clinical outcomes following LDRT result from potent Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses that rebalance the oxidatively skewed redox states of immunological cells, driving them toward anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Activation of Nrf2 by ionizing radiation is highly dose dependent and conforms to the features of a biphasic (hormetic) dose-response. At the cellular and subcellular levels, hormetic doses of < 1.0 Gy induce polarization shifts in the predominant population of lung macrophages, from an M1 pro-inflammatory to an M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype. Together, the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant responses and the subsequent shifts to anti-inflammatory phenotypes have the capacity to suppress cytokine storms, resolve inflammation, promote tissue repair, and prevent COVID-19-related mortality. Given these mechanistic considerations—and the historical clinical success of LDRT early in the 20(th) century—we opine that LDRT should be regarded as safe and effective for use at almost any stage of COVID-19 infection. In theory, however, optimal life-saving potential is thought to occur when LDRT is applied prior to the cytokine storms and before the patients are placed on mechanical oxygen ventilators. The administration of LDRT either as an intervention of last resort or too early in the disease progression may be far less effective in saving the lives of ARDS patients.","Calabrese, Edward J.; Kozumbo, Walter J.; Kapoor, Rachna; Dhawan, Gaurav; Jimenez, Pedro C.

In the first part of this study, we investigated the correlations among chicken dropping moisture content, environmental factors, and production performance. In the second part, we explored whether the addition of three types of additives added individually could reduce the dropping moisture content. The results showed that the dropping moisture level was not associated with production performance or any environmental factors at different locations at the same henhouse height. The probiotic additive (active yeast) significantly reduced the dropping moisture rate. These findings can improve strategies for dealing with high dropping moisture levels and contribute to the enhancement of chicken production. ABSTRACT: Dropping moisture (DM) refers to the water content in feces. High DM negatively affects poultry production, environment, production costs, and animal health. Heredity, nutrition, environment, and disease may affect DM level. DM has medium inheritability and is related to cage height in henhouses. We examined the relationship among DM level, production performance, and environmental factors at different locations at the same henhouse height and effects of three types of additives. We measured the correlation between environmental factors including temperature, humidity, CO(2) concentration, absolute pressure, and DM levels and laying performance of 934 Rhode Island Red hens. DM level was not significantly associated with environmental factors or production performance. We divided 64 persistently high DM hens into control and treatment groups supplied with different additives (probiotics, anisodamine, and antibiotics). DM levels, laying performance, egg quality, and serum biochemical indices were determined. Compared with the control and antibiotics, probiotics significantly reduced DM levels and eggshell strength while improving yolk color but did not significantly affect production performance. The additives reduced the b value of eggshell color; compared with probiotics, anisodamine decreased serum globulin levels. Exogenous active yeast supplementation can significantly reduce DM levels.","Cheng, Xue; Liu, Yuchen; Wang, Zhong; Qu, Lujiang; Ning, Zhonghua",Animals (Basel),389,22

These unintended consequences can be far-reaching and just as important as the intended ones. The World Health Organization identified the assessment of unintended consequences of COVID-19 mitigation measures as a top priority. Thus far, however, their systematic assessment has been neglected due to the inattention of researchers as well as the lack of training and practical tools. MAIN TEXT: Over six years our team has gained extensive experience conducting research on the unintended consequences of complex health interventions. Through a reflexive process, we developed insights that can be useful for researchers in this area. Our analysis is based on key literature and lessons learned reflexively in conducting multi-site and multi-method studies on unintended consequences. Here we present practical guidance for researchers wishing to assess the unintended consequences of COVID-19 mitigation measures. To ensure resource allocation, protocols should include research questions regarding unintended consequences at the outset. Social science theories and frameworks are available to help assess unintended consequences. To determine which changes are unintended, researchers must first understand the intervention theory. To facilitate data collection, researchers can begin by forecasting potential unintended consequences through literature reviews and discussions with stakeholders. Including desirable and neutral unintended consequences in the scope of study can help minimize the negative bias reported in the literature. Exploratory methods can be powerful tools to capture data on the unintended consequences that were unforeseen by researchers. We recommend researchers cast a wide net by inquiring about different aspects of the mitigation measures. Some unintended consequences may only be observable in subsequent years, so longitudinal approaches may be useful. An equity lens is necessary to assess how mitigation measures may unintentionally increase disparities. Finally, stakeholders can help validate the classification of consequences as intended or unintended. CONCLUSION: Studying the unintended consequences of COVID-19 mitigation measures is not only possible but also necessary to assess their overall value. The practical guidance presented will help program planners and evaluators gain a more comprehensive understanding of unintended consequences to refine mitigation measures.

As shortages in rehabilitation professionals increase, especially in rural areas, there is a growing need to deliver care in the communities where patients live, work, learn, and play. Traditional telepresence, while useful, fails to deliver the rich interactions and data needed for motor rehabilitation and assessment. METHODS: We designed Lil’Flo, targeted towards pediatric patients with cerebral palsy and brachial plexus injuries using results from prior usability studies. The system combines traditional telepresence and computer vision with a humanoid, who can play games with patients and guide them in a present and engaging way under the supervision of a remote clinician. We surveyed 13 rehabilitation clinicians in a virtual usability test to evaluate the system. RESULTS: The system is more portable, extensible, and cheaper than our prior iteration, with an expressive humanoid. The virtual usability testing shows that clinicians believe Lil’Flo could be deployed in rural and elder care facilities and is more capable of remote stretching, strength building, and motor assessments than traditional video only telepresence. CONCLUSIONS: Lil’Flo represents a novel approach to delivering rehabilitation care in the community while maintaining the clinician-patient connection.","Sobrepera, Michael J; Lee, Vera G; Johnson, Michelle J",J Rehabil Assist Technol Eng,389,12

However, once it becomes available, there will not be enough to vaccinate everybody at once. Therefore, vaccination and social distancing has to be coordinated. In this paper, we provide some insight on this topic using optimization-based control on an age-differentiated compartmental model. For real-life decision making we investigate the impact of the planning horizon on the optimal vaccination/social distancing strategy. We find that in order to reduce social distancing in the long run without overburdening the intensive care units it is essential to vaccinate the people with the highest contact rates first. However, for short-term planning it is optimal to focus on the high-risk group. Furthermore, large amounts of a vaccine with a lower success rate allows for more reduction of the social distancing than smaller amounts of a vaccine with higher success rate.","Grundel, S.; Heyder, S.; Hotz, T.; Ritschel, T.

Viral RNAs (vRNAs) are central to infection. They carry all the necessary information for a virus to synthesize its proteins, replicate and spread and could also play essential non-coding roles. Regardless of its origin or tropism, vRNA has by definition evolved in the presence of host RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs), which resulted in intricate and complicated interactions with these factors. While on one hand some host RBPs recognize vRNA as non-self and mobilize host antiviral defenses, vRNA must also co-opt other host RBPs to promote viral infection. Focusing on pathogenic RNA viruses, we will review important scenarios of RBP-vRNA interactions during which host RBPs recognize, modify or degrade vRNAs. We will then focus on how vRNA hijacks the largest ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) in the cell, the ribosome, to selectively promote the synthesis of its proteins. We will finally reflect on how novel technologies are helping in deepening our understanding of vRNA-host RBPs interactions, which can be ultimately leveraged to combat everlasting viral threats.","Girardi, Erika; Pfeffer, Sebastien; Baumert, Thomas F.; Majzoub, Karim",Semin Cell Dev Biol,389,14

SARS-Co-V-2 viral genomes were detected and sequenced from 18 Romanian patients suffering from coronavirus disease-2019. Viral Spike S glycoprotein sequences were used to generate model structures and assess the role of mutations on protein stability. We integrated the phylogenetic tree within the available European SARS-Co-V-2 genomic sequences. We further provide an epidemiological overview of the pre-existing conditions that are lethal in relevant Romanian patients. Non-synonymous mutations in the viral Spike glycoprotein relating to infectivity are constructed in models of protein structures. Continuing search to limit and treat SARS-CoV-2 benefit from our contribution in delineating the viral Spike glycoprotein mutations, as well as from assessment of their role on protein stability or complex formation with human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.

Rapid self-tests could improve access to influenza testing in community settings. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a mobile app-guided influenza rapid self-test for adults with influenza like illness (ILI), and identify optimal methods for conducting accuracy studies for home-based assays for influenza and other respiratory viruses. METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited adults who self-reported ILI online. Participants downloaded a mobile app, which guided them through two low nasal swab self-samples. Participants tested the index swab using a lateral flow assay. Test accuracy results were compared to the reference swab tested in a research laboratory for influenza A/B using a molecular assay. RESULTS: Analysis included 739 participants, 80% were 25–64 years of age, 79% female, and 73% white. Influenza positivity was 5.9% based on the laboratory reference test. Of those who started their test, 92% reported a self-test result. The sensitivity and specificity of participants’ interpretation of the test result compared to the laboratory reference standard were 14% (95%CI 5–28%) and 90% (95%CI 87–92%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A mobile app facilitated study procedures to determine the accuracy of a home based test for influenza, however, test sensitivity was low. Recruiting individuals outside clinical settings who self-report ILI symptoms may lead to lower rates of influenza and/or less severe disease. Earlier identification of study subjects within 48 h of symptom onset through inclusion criteria and rapid shipping of tests or pre-positioning tests is needed to allow self-testing earlier in the course of illness, when viral load is higher.

The main findings are: (1) Respiratory physiotherapy interventions were not indicated in the majority of the patients with COVID-19 in this case series; (2) During rehabilitation, exertional or position-related desaturation is a common feature observed in critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection locally. This clinical phenomenon of exertional or positional-related desaturation has significantly slowed down the progression of rehabilitation in our patients. As such, it can potentially result in a significant burden on healthcare resources to provide rehabilitation to these patients.

This challenge was presented by AARP to graduate students in a Digital Health course at Tufts University School of Medicine. The design thinking process was used to create a product that would meet this need, keeping the needs and constraints of older adults, especially those with chronic conditions or other barriers to health, central to the solution. The initial steps involved understanding and empathizing with the target audience through interviews and by developing personas and scenarios that identified barriers and opportunities. The later steps were to ideate potential solutions, design a prototype, and define product success. The design thinking process led to the design of Home Health Hub, a remote patient monitoring (RPM) platform designed to meet the unique needs of older adults. Additionally, Home Health Hub can conceivably benefit all users of telehealth, regardless of health status-an important need during the COVID-19 pandemic, and in general due to increased use of virtual visits. Home Health Hub is one example of what can be achieved with the dedicated use of design thinking. The design thinking process can benefit public health practice as a whole by encouraging practitioners to delve into a problem to find the root causes and empathize with the needs and constraints of stakeholders to design innovative, human-centered solutions.","Kolnick, H A; Miller, Jennifer E; Dupree, Olivia; Gualtieri, Lisa",Online journal of public health informatics,389,22

BACKGROUND: COVID‐19 has spread globally, causing an unprecedentedly large number of casualties. Nurses face challenges in dealing with patients with COVID‐19 with limited information about the pathogen. DESIGN: This qualitative study followed the COREQ guidelines. METHODS: Fifteen nurses were recruited from two university hospitals in South Korea using a snowballing technique for in‐depth interviews in May 2020. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Content analysis was performed on the interview data. RESULTS: Two themes emerged: access to COVID‐19 information and the impact of information on nursing care. The categories of access to COVID‐19 information were lack of nursing‐specific information, limited information cascading from top management and confusion due to varying points of view. The categories of the impact of information on nursing care were unprepared management that aggravates exhaustion, lack of personal protective equipment that creates anxiety and being a nurse leader to overcome the pandemic. CONCLUSION: During a pandemic of emerging infectious diseases, nurses should have access to up‐to‐date information tailored to their working environment. Human resources, material resources and systematic support are needed for nurses who provide care for patients with an infectious disease. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A collaborative interprofessional education system for emerging infectious diseases is needed for effective communication and consistent care during a pandemic. Nurse leaders should be prepared to deliver profession‐specific information for standardised care and respond to nursing management needs by using resources and tailoring the workforce.","Cha, Chiyoung; Park, Suhyun",J Clin Nurs,389,1

Beside significant mortality, the SARS-CoV-2 infection causes considerable and sustained morbidity, dubbed long COVID. This paper argues that some of this morbidity may be due to a persistent systemic infection. Persistent infection is indicated by continued virus RNA shedding. The virus’ superantigen could overstimulate anti-virus immune responses, and thereby induce negative feedback loops, that paradoxically allow the virus to persist. The superantigen would induce strong immune response to any residual infection. This hypothesis suggests that clearing the virus infection completely would be an appropriate intervention against long COVID.","Jacobs, John J.L.",Med Hypotheses,389,3

It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel virus that can be transmitted easily from human to human mainly by the respiratory route. Currently, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 or a vaccine for prevention. The disease has various degrees of severity. It often presents with non-specific symptoms such as fever, headache, and fatigue, accompanied by respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough and dyspnea) and other systemic involvement. Severe disease is associated with hemophagocytic syndrome and cytokine storm due to altered immune response. Patients with severe disease are more likely to have increased liver enzymes. The disease can affect the liver through various mechanisms. CASE REPORT: We report an unusual case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 24-year-old man with no previous medical illness, who presented with mild respiratory involvement. He had no serious lung injury during the disease course. However, he experienced acute fulminant hepatitis B infection and cytokine release syndrome that led to multiorgan failure and death. CONCLUSIONS: It is uncommon for SARS-CoV-2 infection with mild respiratory symptoms to result in severe systemic disease and organ failure. We report an unusual case of acute hepatitis B infection with concomitant SARS-CoV-2 leading to fulminant hepatitis, multiorgan failure, and death.","Ali, Elrazi; Ziglam, Hisham; Kohla, Samah; Ahmed, Mohanad; Yassin, Mohamed",Am J Case Rep,389,17

COVID19 was first detected in Pennsylvania in March 2020 and non-essential services were strictly curtailed (including school closures), with easing of curtailments by the fall 2020 (including hybrid schooling in some districts). We determined if changes in sleep duration were consistent during pre-, earlier, and later COVID19 periods. METHODS: Typically developing children (9-12y) with sleep duration <8.5 hours per weeknight were enrolled. Sleep was measured using Fitbit devices during a baseline week and a 7-week intervention period. A factorial design was used to test five candidate intervention components: 1) sleep goal; 2) electronic device reduction messaging; 3) daily routine messaging; 4) child-directed financial incentive; and 5) parent-directed financial incentive. Sleep data were transmitted to a mobile health platform that automated delivery of the intervention components. We categorized participants when they completed the study: 1) Spring-Fall 2019 semesters (pre-COVID19); 2) Spring 2020 semester (started pre-COVID19, with strict restrictions impacting intervention periods); or 3) Fall 2020 semester (easing of COVID19 restrictions). Mixed effect modelling determined sleep changes. RESULTS: Mean age of participants was 11.6y (51% female and 29% Black participants). Pre-COVID19 (N=59), average sleep duration increased from baseline by 21 (95% CI: 10, 30) minutes per weeknight during the intervention. In spring 2020 (N=18), the average sleep duration increase was two times larger in magnitude at 41 (95% CI: 25, 59) minutes per weeknight. For fall 2020 (N=20), the average sleep duration increase was 24 (95% CI: 7, 40) minutes per weeknight. Changes in sleep timing from baseline during the intervention were consistent pre-COVID19 and in the fall 2020 (e.g., ≈15 minutes earlier sleep onset throughout the intervention period), whereas sleep timing changes were dynamic in the spring 2020 (e.g., 41 minutes earlier for week 1, and 44 minutes later for week 7). CONCLUSION: This sleep intervention demonstrated increases in sleep duration pre-COVID19, with marked duration increases and dynamic timing changes coinciding with COVID19 restrictions during earlier (Spring 2020), but not later (Fall 2020), weeks of the COVID19 pandemic in Pennsylvania.

However, this field of research and its potential for implementation into diabetes care is still in its infancy. In this narrative review, we aim to address the state-of-the-art of social network research in type 2 diabetes prevention and care. Despite the diverse nature and heterogeneity of social network assessments, we can draw valuable lessons from the available studies. First, the structural network variable ‘living alone’ and the functional network variable ‘lack of social support’ have been associated with increased type 2 diabetes risk. The latter association may be modified by lifestyle risk factors, such as obesity, low level of physical activity and unhealthy diet. Second, smaller network size and less social support is associated with increased risk of diabetes complications, particularly chronic kidney disease and CHD. Third, current evidence shows a beneficial impact of social support on diabetes self-management. In addition, social support interventions were found to have a small, favourable effect on HbA(1c) values in the short-term. However, harmonisation and more detailed assessment of social network measurements are needed to utilise social network characteristics for more effective prevention and disease management in type 2 diabetes.

It is motivated by the ongoing covid-19 global epidemic, but expands to a broader view on the crises that disrupt food systems and threaten food security, locally to globally. Beyond the public health crisis it is causing, the current global pandemic is impacting food systems, locally and globally. Crises such as the present one can, and do, affect the stability of food production. One of the worst fears is the impacts that crises could have on the potential to produce food, that is, on the primary production of food itself, for example, if material and non-material infrastructure on which agriculture depends were to be damaged, weakened, or fall in disarray. Looking beyond the present, and not minimising its importance, the covid-19 crisis may turn out to be the trigger for overdue fundamental transformations of agriculture and the global food system. This is because the global food system does not work well today: the number of hungry people in the world has increased substantially, with the World Food Programme warning of the possibility of a “hunger pandemic”. Food also must be nutritious, yet unhealthy diets are a leading cause of death. Deepening crises impoverish the poorest, disrupt food systems, and expand “food deserts”. A focus on healthy diets for all is all the more relevant when everyone’s immune system must react to infection during a global pandemic. There is also accumulating and compelling evidence that the global food system is pushing the Earth system beyond the boundaries of sustainability. In the past twenty years, the growing demand for food has increasingly been met through the destruction of Earth’s natural environment, and much less through progress in agricultural productivity generated by scientific research, as was the case during the two previous decades. There is an urgent need to reduce the environmental footprint of the global food system: if its performances are not improved rapidly, the food system could itself be one main cause for food crises in the near future. The article concludes with a series of recommendations intended for policy makers and science leaders to improve the resilience of the food system, global to local, and in the short, medium and long term.","Savary, Serge; Akter, Sonia; Almekinders, Conny; Harris, Jody; Korsten, Lise; Rötter, Reimund; Waddington, Stephen; Watson, Derrill",Food Secur,389,28

Since the first sequenced whole-genome of SARS-CoV-2 on January 2020, the identification of its genetic variants has become crucial in tracking and evaluating their spread across the globe. In this study, we compared 134,905 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from all affected countries since the outbreak of this novel coronavirus with the first sequenced genome in Wuhan, China to quantify the evolutionary divergence of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, we compared the codon usage patterns of SARS-CoV-2 genes encoding the membrane protein (M), envelope (E), spike surface glycoprotein (S), nucleoprotein (N), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The polyproteins ORF1a and ORF1b were examined separately. We found that SARS-CoV-2 tends to diverge over time by accumulating mutations on its genome and, specifically, on the sequences encoding proteins N and S. Interestingly, different patterns of codon usage were observed among these genes. Genes S and N tend to use a narrower set of synonymous codons that are better optimized to the human host. Conversely, genes E and M consistently use the broader set of synonymous codons, which does not vary in respect to the reference genome. CAI and SiD time evolutions show a tendency to decrease that emerge for most genes. Forsdyke plots are used to study the nature of mutations and they show a rapid evolutionary divergence of each gene, due to the low values of x-intercepets.","Posani, Elisa; Dilucca, Maddalena; Forcelloni, Sergio; Pavlopoulou, Athanasia; Georgakilas, Alexandros G.; Giansanti, Andrea",bioRxiv,389,1

In this paper, we review the knowledge regarding the entry and release of coronaviruses, with particular emphasis on the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses. As these viruses approach the epithelial surfaces from the apical side, it is not surprising that coronavirus cell receptors are exposed primarily on the apical domain of polarized epithelial cells. With respect to release, all possibilities appear to occur. Thus, most coronaviruses exit through the apical surface, several through the basolateral one, although the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus appears to use both sides.

By harnessing the regulatory effects of adenosine on inflammatory mediators, we have instituted a new therapeutic treatment with inhaled adenosine in COVID-19 patients, with the aim of reducing inflammation, the onset of cytokine storm, and therefore to improve prognosis. The use of inhaled adenosine in COVID19 patients has allowed reduction of length of stay, on average 6 days. This result is strengthened by the decrease in SARS-CoV-2 positive days. In treated patients compared to control, a clear improvement in PaO(2)/FiO(2) was observed together with a reduction in inflammation parameters, such as the decrease of CRP level. Furthermore, the efficacy of inhaled exogenous adenosine led to an improvement of the prognosis indices, NLR and PLR. The treatment seems to be safe and modulates the immune system, allowing an effective response against the viral infection progression, reducing length of stay and inflammation parameters.","Caracciolo, Massimo; Correale, Pierpaolo; Mangano, Carmelo; Foti, Giuseppe; Falcone, Carmela; Macheda, Sebastiano; Cuzzola, Maria; Conte, Marco; Falzea, Antonella Consuelo; Iuliano, Eleonora; Morabito, Antonella; Caraglia, Michele; Polimeni, Nicola; Ferrarelli, Anna; Labate, Demetrio; Tescione, Marco; Di Renzo, Laura; Chiricolo, Gaetano; Romano, Lorenzo; De Lorenzo, Antonino",Front Immunol,389,20

With the rapid and sustained growth of the publications on COVID-19 research, we will perform a living systematic review (LSR) to provide comprehensive and continuously updated data to explore the prevalence of delirium, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We will perform a comprehensive search of the following databases: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Chinese Biomedicine Literature to identify relevant studies. We will include peer-reviewed cross-sectional studies published in English and Chinese. Two reviewers will independently assess the methodological quality of included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal tool and perform data extraction. In the absence of clinical heterogeneity, the prevalence estimates with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of delirium, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) will be calculated by using random-effects model to minimize the effect of between-study heterogeneity separately. The literature searches will be updated every 3 months. We will perform meta-analysis if any new eligible studies or data are obtained. We will resubmit an updated review when there were relevant changes in the results, i.e., when outcomes became statistically significant (or not statistically significant anymore) or when heterogeneity became substantial (or not substantial anymore). DISCUSSION: This LSR will provide an in-depth and up-to-date summary of whether the common neuropsychiatric conditions observed in patients hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) are also prevalent in a different stage of COVID-19 patients.

Methods: We surveyed the SARS-CoV-2 infection among the HCWs in a hospital by screening of antibody levels and detection of viral RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) between May 2020 to December 2020. Occupational and non-occupational potential predictors of disease were surveyed for the HCWs included in this study. Results: Among 1925 personnel in the hospital, 1732 were included to the study with the response rate of 90%. Overall seroprevalence was 15% at the end of 2020, before vaccinations started. In multivariate analysis, being janitorial staff (OR:2.24, CI:1.21-4.14, p=0.011), being medical secretary (OR: 4.17, CI: 2.12-8.18, p<0.001), having at least one household member with COVID-19 diagnosis (OR:8.98, CI: 6.64-12.15, p<0.001) and number of household members >3 (OR:1.67, CI:1.26-2.22, p<0.001) were found to be significantly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion: By the end of 2020, just before the era of vaccination and variants, seroprevalence was 15% among HCWs. Medical secretary and janitorial staff were under increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Community-hospital gradient can explain the mode of transmission for infection among HCWs. In the setting of this study, community measures were less strict, whereas hospital infection control was adequate and provided necessary personal protective equipment.

Currently, there is no decisive therapy for COVID-19 or related complications. The only hope to mitigate this pandemic is through vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccines are being developed rapidly, compared to traditional vaccines, and are being approved via Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) worldwide. So far, there are 232 vaccine candidates. One hundred and seventy-two are in preclinical development and 60 in clinical development, of which 9 are approved under EUA by different countries. This includes the United Kingdom (UK), United States of America (USA), Canada, Russia, China, and India. Distributing vaccination to all, with a safe and efficacious vaccine is the leading priority for all nations to combat this COVID-19 pandemic. However, the current accelerated process of COVID-19 vaccine development and EUA has many unanswered questions. In addition, the change in strain of SARS-CoV-2 in UK and South Africa, and its increasing spread across the world have raised more challenges, both for the vaccine developers as well as the governments across the world.

Some of these measures have been taken into account by the administrative boundaries within cities (neighborhoods, postal districts, etc.). However, considering only administrative boundaries in decision making can prove imprecise, and could have consequences when it comes to taking effective measures. To solve the described problems, we present an epidemiological study that proposes using spatial point patterns to delimit spatial units of analysis based on the highest local incidence of hospitalisations instead of administrative limits during the first COVID-19 wave. For this purpose, the 579 addresses of the cases hospitalised between March 3 and April 6, 2020, in Albacete (Spain), and the addresses of the random sample of 383 controls from the Inhabitants Register of the city of Albacete, were georeferenced. The risk ratio in those hospitalised for COVID-19 was compatible with the constant risk ratio in Albacete (p = 0.49), but areas with a significantly higher risk were found and coincided with those with greater economic inequality (Gini Index). Moreover, two districts had areas with a significantly high incidence that were masked by others with a significantly low incidence. In conclusion, taking measures conditioned exclusively by administrative limits in a pandemic can cause problems caused by managing entire districts with lax measures despite having interior areas with high significant incidences. In a pandemic context, georeferencing disease cases in real time and spatially comparing them to updated random population controls to automatically and accurately detect areas with significant incidences are suggested. This would facilitate decision making, which must be fast and accurate in these situations.","Garcia-Morata, Marta; Gonzalez-Rubio, Jesus; Segura, Tomas; Najera, Alberto",Sci Total Environ,389,26

The initial areas of demyelination increase only slightly after the control of infection. These circumscribed focal lesions are characterized by axonal sparing, myelin ingestion by macrophage/microglia, and glial scars associated with hypertrophic astrocytes, which proliferate at the lesion border. Accelerated virus control in mice lacking the anti‐inflammatory cytokine IL‐10 was associated with limited initial demyelination, but low viral mRNA persistence similar to WT mice and declining antiviral cellular immunity. Nevertheless, lesions exhibited sustained expansion providing a model of dysregulated white matter injury temporally remote from the acute CNS insult. Expanding lesions in the absence of IL‐10 are characterized by sustained microglial activation and partial loss of macrophage/microglia exhibiting an acquired deactivation phenotype. Furthermore, IL‐10 deficiency impaired astrocyte organization into mesh like structures at the lesion borders, but did not prevent astrocyte hypertrophy. The formation of discrete foci of demyelination in IL‐10 sufficient mice correlated with IL‐10 receptor expression exclusively on astrocytes in areas of demyelination suggesting a critical role for IL‐10 signaling to astrocytes in limiting expansion of initial areas of white matter damage.

As only very limited therapeutic options are clinically available, there is an urgent need for the rapid development of safe, effective, and globally available pharmaceuticals that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry and ameliorate COVID-19 severity. In this study, we explored the use of small compounds acting on the homeostasis of the endolysosomal host-pathogen interface, to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find that fluoxetine, a widely used antidepressant and a functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase (FIASMA), efficiently inhibited the entry and propagation of SARS-CoV-2 in the cell culture model without cytotoxic effects and also exerted potent antiviral activity against two currently circulating influenza A virus subtypes, an effect which was also observed upon treatment with the FIASMAs amiodarone and imipramine. Mechanistically, fluoxetine induced both impaired endolysosomal acidification and the accumulation of cholesterol within the endosomes. As the FIASMA group consists of a large number of small compounds that are well-tolerated and widely used for a broad range of clinical applications, exploring these licensed pharmaceuticals may offer a variety of promising antivirals for host-directed therapy to counteract enveloped viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.","Schloer, Sebastian; Brunotte, Linda; Goretzko, Jonas; Mecate-Zambrano, Angeles; Korthals, Nadia; Gerke, Volker; Ludwig, Stephan; Rescher, Ursula",Emerging microbes & infections,389,27

The system involves inducible expression of individual viral proteins and identification of detrimental phenotypes in the yeast. Yeast knockout and overexpression libraries can then be used for genome-wide screening of host proteins that provide a suppressor phenotype. From the yeast hits, a narrowed list of candidate genes can be produced to investigate for roles in viral replication. Since the system only requires expression of viral proteins, it can be used for any current or emerging virus, regardless of biocontainment requirements and ability to culture the virus.

The infection of cells with srr7 (soluble‐receptor‐resistant mutant 7) is dependent on a known MHV receptor (MHVR), carcinoembryonic cell adhesion molecule 1a, whereas cl‐2 shows MHVR‐independent infection. Initial viral antigens were detected between 12 and 24 h post‐inoculation (p.i) in the infiltrating cells that appeared in the subarachnoidal space of mouse brains infected with viruses. There were no significant differences in the intensity or spread of viral antigens in the inflammatory cells between the two viruses. However, 48 h after infection with cl‐2, viral antigen‐positive cells in the grey matter with the shape of neurons, which do not express MHVR, were detected, while srr7 infection was observed primarily in the white matter. Some of the viral antigen‐positive inflammatory cells found in the subarachnoidal space during the early phase of infection reacted with anti‐F4/80 or anti‐CD11b monoclonal antibodies. Syncytial giant cells (SGCs) expressing viral and CD11b antigens were also detected among these inflammatory cells. These antigen‐positive cells appeared in the subarachnoidal space prior to viral antigen spread into the brain parenchyma, indicating that viral encephalitis starts with the infection of infiltrating monocytes which express MHVR. Furthermore, the observation indicates that viral infection has cytopathic effects on the monocyte lineage, which plays a critical role in innate immunity, leading to the rapid spread of viruses during the early stage of infection.","Takatsuki, Hanae; Taguchi, Fumihiro; Nomura, Risa; Kashiwazaki, Hiromi; Watanabe, Mariko; Ikehara, Yuzuru; Watanabe, Rihito",Neuropathology,389,16

Compared with children born at term, children born MLP are at increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Despite making up the largest group of preterm children, developmental outcomes of children born MLP are less well studied than in other preterm groups. This study aimed to (1) compare neurodevelopmental, respiratory health and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes between children born MLP and term at 9 years of age; (2) examine the differences in brain growth trajectory from infancy to 9 years between children born MLP and term; and in children born MLP; (3) examine the relationship between brain development and neurodevelopment at 9 years; and (4) identify risk factors for poorer outcomes at 9 years. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The ”LaPrem” (Late Preterm MRI Study) study is a longitudinal cohort study of children born MLP and term controls, born at the Royal Women’s Hospital in Melbourne, Australia, between 2010 and 2013. Participants were recruited in the neonatal period and were previously followed up at 2 and 5 years.

Through our work, we discover a series of security risks emerging because of the realities of this period. For instance, lack of remote-working security training, heightened stress and anxiety, rushed technology deployment, and the presence of untrusted individuals in a remote-working environment (e.g., in flatshares), can result in new cyber-risk. Simultaneously, we find that as organisations look to manage these and other risks posed by their remote workforces, employee's privacy (including personal information and activities) is often compromised. This is apparent in the significant adoption of remote workplace monitoring, management and surveillance technologies.

The disease caused by novel coronavirus is termed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We present the case of a renal transplant patient who was infected with COVID-19 through community spread and presented with fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. Transplant recipients are particularly vulnerable because of the immunosuppressed state. These patients can shed a virus for a prolonged period and can have a higher load of the virus. There have been no COVID-19 cases transmitted through organ donation. Preinfection immunological impairment can aggravate the severity of the infection. The transplant team plays a crucial role in donor and recipient evaluation and guiding the timing of the transplant. Although specific published data are lacking with regard to transplant recipients, they should follow the same precautions as the general population, like avoiding nonessential travel and practice social distancing.","Adapa, Sreedhar; Konala, Venu Madhav; Naramala, Srikanth; Daggubati, Subba Rao; Koduri, Narayana Murty; Gayam, Vijay; Chenna, Avantika",J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,389,16

The sudden shift of personnel and resources towards COVID‐19 care has led to the reduction of surgery, with possible severe drawbacks. The aim of the study is to describe the trend in surgical volume in urology, in Italy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty‐three urological units with physicians affiliated to the AGILE consortium were involved in a survey. Urologists were asked to report the amount of surgical elective procedures week‐by‐week, from the beginning of the emergency to the following month. RESULTS: The 33 hospitals involved in the study account, globally, for 22,945 beds and are distributed in 13/20 Italian regions. Before the outbreak, the involved urology units performed an overall amount of 1,213 procedures per week, half of which were oncological. One month later, the amount of surgery declined by 78%. Lombardy, the first region with positive‐cases, experienced a 94% reduction. The decrease in oncological and non‐oncological surgical activity was 35,9% and 89%, respectively. The trend of the decline showed a delay of roughly 2 weeks for the other regions. CONCLUSION: Italy, the country with the highest fatality rate from COVID‐19, is experiencing a sudden decline in surgical activity. It is inversely related to the increase in COVID‐19 care, with potential harm particularly in the oncological field. The Italian experience can be helpful for future surgical pre‐planning in other countries not so hardly hit by the disease yet.","Rocco, B; Sighinolfi, MC; Sandri, M; Altieri, V; Amenta, M; Annino, F; Antonelli, A; Baio, R; Bertolo, R; Bocciardi, A; Borghesi, M; Bove, P; Bozzini, G; Cacciamani, G; Calori, A; Caffarelli, A; Celia, A; Cocci, A; Corsaro, A; Costa, G; Ceruti, C; Cindolo, L; Crivellaro, S; Dalpiaz, O; D’Agostino, D; Dall’Oglio, B; Falabella, R; Falsaperla, M; Finocchiaro, M; Gaboardi, F; Galfano, A; Gallo, F; Greco, F; Leonardo, C; Nucciotti, R; Oderda, M; Pagliarulo, V; Parma, P; Pastore, L; Pini, G; Porreca, A; Pucci, L; Schenone, M; Schiavina, R; Sciorio, C; Spirito, L; Tafuri, A; Terrone, C; Umari, P; Varca, V; Veneziano, D; Verze, P; Volpe, A; Micali, S; Berti, L; Zaramella, S; Minervini, A",BJU Int,389,1

There are international differences in public cognitive and behavioral pattern, attitudes toward information sources, and anxiety about COVID-19. Information about these differences could increase understanding of the patterns of epidemic-related anxiety and behavior, and would help optimize future policies for preventing the next wave of the epidemic. METHODS: To examine between-country differences in perception, attitude, and precautionary behaviors toward COVID-19, we conducted a cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire survey. Participants were adults who had been registered in Cross Marketing Group Inc. and living in the UK, Spain, or Japan. A total of 8,000 people stratified by age were recruited on a first-come, first-serve basis. Knowledge of and anxiety about COVID-19, the frequency of access and perceived credibility of several information sources, and the frequency of each precautionary behavior were examined on March 27–28, 2020, in Japan and April 17–21, 2020, in the UK and Spain. RESULTS: Knowledge, anxiety, and the frequency of precautionary behaviors were higher in the UK and Spain than in Japan. Participants with infected acquaintances were more concerned about COVID-19. However, participants in the UK rarely wore a medical mask. Participants in the UK and Spain were more eager to obtain information about COVID-19 than those in Japan. Participants in Spain tended not to trust official information and to believe specialists’ comments instead. CONCLUSION: The rapidity of the spread of COVID-19, cultural background, and recent political situations seemed to contribute to the international differences here.","Shiina, Akihiro; Niitsu, Tomihisa; Kobori, Osamu; Idemoto, Keita; Hashimoto, Tasuku; Sasaki, Tsuyoshi; Igarashi, Yoshito; Shimizu, Eiji; Nakazato, Michiko; Hashimoto, Kenji; Iyo, Masaomi",Ann Gen Psychiatry,389,22

The mass application of mechanical ventilation and its subsequent technical advancement helped manage large numbers of patients with respiratory failure. This branch of medicine evolved much faster in high-income (HIC) than low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Seventy years later, mankind’s encounter with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents another major challenge for critical care medicine especially in LMIC countries where over two thirds of the world population live. METHODS: Systematic analysis of written documents related to the establishment of the first multidisciplinary medical intensive care unit (MICU) in Bosnia and Herzegovina and its development to the present day. RESULTS: We describe the experience of setting up a modern critical care program under LMIC constraints as a promising way forward to meet the increased worldwide demand for critical care. Successful development is contingent on formal education and continued mentorship from HIC, establishment of a multidisciplinary team, the support from local health care authorities, development of a formal subspecialty training, academic faculty development, and research. Novel technologies including tele-education provide additional opportunities for rapid development and dissemination of critical care medicine programs in LMIC. CONCLUSION: Critical care medicine is a critical public health need in HIC and LMIC alike. The challenges associated with the coronavirus pandemic should serve as a wakeup call for rapid development of critical care programs around the world.","Kovacevic, P.; Meyer, F.

(2) The study lasted 28 consecutive days and was performed on 45 male Wistar rats randomly divided into six groups. These included two groups treated by abdominal injection of DEX at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day supplemented with vegetable oil (DEX PL; n = 7) or with vitamin D(3) 600 IU/kg/day (DEX SUP; n = 8), respectively, and a control group treated with an abdominal injection of saline (CON; n = 6). In addition, there were two groups of rats chronically stressed by cold water immersion (1 hour/day in a glass box with 1-cm-deep ice/water mixture; temperature ~4 °C), which were supplemented with vegetable oil as a placebo (STR PL; n = 9) or vitamin D(3) at 600 IU/kg/day (STR SUP; n = 9). The last group was of sham-stressed rats (SHM; n = 6). Blood, soleus, extensor digitorum longus, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, and quadriceps femoris muscles were collected and weighed. The heart, liver, spleen, and thymus were removed and weighed immediately after sacrifice. The plasma corticosterone (CORT) and vitamin D(3) metabolites were measured. (3) We found elevated CORT levels in both cold water-immersed groups; however, they did not alter body and muscle weight. Body weight and muscle loss occurred in groups with exogenously administered DEX, with the exception of the soleus muscle in rats supplemented with vitamin D(3). Decreased serum 25(OH)D(3) concentrations in DEX-treated rats were observed, and the cold water immersion did not affect vitamin D(3) levels.

Through enormous scientific effort, thousands of viral strains have been sequenced to date, thereby creating a strong background for deep bioinformatics studies of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. In this study, we inspected high-frequency mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and carried out systematic analyses of their overlay with inverted repeat (IR) loci and CpG islands. The main conclusion of our study is that SARS-CoV-2 hot-spot mutations are significantly enriched within both IRs and CpG island loci. This points to their role in genomic instability and may predict further mutational drive of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Moreover, CpG islands are strongly enriched upstream from viral ORFs and thus could play important roles in transcription and the viral life cycle. We hypothesize that hypermethylation of these loci will decrease the transcription of viral ORFs and could therefore limit the progression of the disease.","Goswami, Pratik; Bartas, Martin; Lexa, Matej; Bohálová, Natália; Volná, Adriana; Červeň, Jiří; Červeňová, Veronika; Pečinka, Petr; Špunda, Vladimír; Fojta, Miroslav; Brázda, Václav",Brief Bioinform,389,16

In contrast, preoperative assessments use cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to categorise patients to higher and lower risk independent of diagnostic labels. Since CPET is not feasible in population-based settings, our aims included evaluation of a triage/screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk. METHODS: CPET-derived anaerobic thresholds were evaluated retrospectively in 26 patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) who represent a challenging group to risk-categorise. Pulmonary AVM-induced hypoxaemia secondary to intrapulmonary right-to-left shunts, anaemia from underlying hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and metabolic equivalents derived from the 13-point Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire (VSAQ) were evaluated as part of routine clinical care. Pre-planned analyses evaluated associations and modelling of the anaerobic threshold and patient-specific variables. RESULTS: In the 26 patients (aged 21-77, median 57 years), anaerobic threshold ranged from 7.6-24.5 (median 12.35) ml.min-1kg-1 and placed more than half of the patients (15, 57.7%) in the >11 ml.min-1kg-1 category suggested as lower-risk for intra-abdominal surgeries. Neither age nor baseline SpO2 predicted anaerobic threshold, or lower/higher risk categories, either alone or in multivariate analyses, despite baseline oxygen saturation (SpO2) ranging from 79 to 99 (median 92)%, haemoglobin from 108 to 183 (median 156)g.L-1. However, lower haemoglobin, and particularly, arterial oxygen content and oxygen pulse were associated with increased cardiorespiratory risk: Modelling a haemoglobin increase of 25g.L-1 placed a further 7/26 (26.9%) patients in a lower risk category. For patients completing the VSAQ, derived metabolic equivalents were strongly associated with anaerobic threshold enabling risk evaluations through a simple questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline exercise tolerance may override age and diagnostic labels in triage settings. These data support approaches to risk reduction by aerobic conditioning and attention to anaemia. The VSAQ is suggested as a rapid screening tool for cardiorespiratory risk assessment to implement during triage/screening.","Thurairatnam, S.; Gawecki, F.; Strangeways, T.; Perks, J.; Santhirapala, V.; Myers, J.; Tighe, H.

Understanding the progression of mental health and factors underlying the perpetuation of distress during the pandemic is pivotal in informing interventions and public health messaging. This current study examined longitudinal effects of two cognitive vulnerabilities, looming cognitive style, and intolerance of uncertainty, as well as coping styles on anxiety and depression through online questionnaires at two time points in the pandemic, May 2020 (N = 1520) and August 2020 (N = 545). Depression, but not anxiety, significantly increased across time, which was moderated by coping style. Serial mediation modeling using path analysis demonstrated a significant pathway illustrating increased looming cognitive style in the beginning of the pandemic leads to increased intolerance of uncertainty, avoidant coping, and anxiety later in the pandemic. Results suggest a novel model in conceptualizing anxiety during the pandemic, namely highlighting looming cognitive style as an underlying cognitive vulnerability factor and antecedent of intolerance of uncertainty and illuminating the temporal directionality between looming cognitive style and intolerance of uncertainty. These findings provide important implications regarding intervention and public health messaging with modifiable behavioral and cognitive factors to improve mental health during a pandemic.","Carnahan, Nicolette D.; Carter, Michele M.; Sbrocco, Tracy",Int J Cogn Ther,389,24

The shelter-in-place measures led the rapid expansion of telemedicine to address the needs of the neurosurgical patient population. Our goal is to determine the extent of adoption of telemedicine across tumor, vascular, spine and function neurosurgery and utilization for new patient visits. Methods Single-center retrospective cohort study of patients who received neurosurgical care at a tertiary academic center from February to April 2020 was conducted. Patients evaluated from March to April 2019 were included for comparison. A total of 10,746 patients were included: 1247 patients underwent surgery, 8,742 were seen in clinic via an in-person outpatient visit and 757 were assessed via telemedicine during the study period. Results A 40-fold increase in the use of telemedicine was noted after the shelter-in-place measures were initiated with a significant increase in the mean number of patients evaluated via telemedicine per week across all divisions of neurosurgery (4.5±0.9 to 180.4±13.9, p<0.001). The majority of telemedicine appointments were established patient visits (61.2%), but the proportion of new patient visits also significantly increased to an average of 8.2±5.3 per week across all divisions. Conclusion Use of telemedicine drastically increased across all four divisions within neurosurgery with a significant increase in online-first encounters in order to meet the needs of our patients once the shelter-in-place measures were implemented. We provide a detailed account of the lessons learned and discuss the anticipated role of telemedicine in surgical practices once the shelter-in-place measures are lifted.","Mouchtouris, Nikolaos; Lavergne, Pascal; Montenegro, Thiago S.; Gonzalez, Glenn; Baldassari, Michael; Sharan, Ashwini; Jabbour, Pascal; Harrop, James; Rosenwasser, Robert; Evans, James J.",World Neurosurg,389,1

As a result, home-based patients with spinal cord injuries (SCI) are not only less able to go out, but they may have difficulty in easily receiving long-term care services. There are concerns that their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) may have deteriorated. We aimed to clarify the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on HRQOL in home-based patients with SCI.In June 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was finally settling down in Japan, we conducted a mail survey of 266 patients with SCI regarding changes in the frequency of going out, the long-term care services, and their HRQOL due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They had all been discharged from our hospital (Rehabilitation medical center) by 2019, and were expected to be living at home. We received answers from 135 patients about their HRQOL. FINDINGS Respondent characteristics indicated that many of them were elderly (74.1% were over 60 years of age) and many had cervical SCI (70.5%). Worsened HRQOL since the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was reported by 40% of respondents. The most commonly reported dimension was pain/discomfort. Significantly, many had been injured comparatively recently and had reduced frequency of going out and receiving home-visit nursing or rehabilitation services than patients whose HRQOL was unchanged. CONCLUSION/ CLINICAL RELEVANCE This study clarifies the negative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on HRQOL in home-based patients with SCI. Many respondents had worsened HRQOL, in particular pain/discomfort. It was suggested that the decrease in the frequency of going out may be one of the factors that affected the deterioration of their HRQOL.","Matsuoka, Mihoko; Sumida, Mikio",The journal of spinal cord medicine,389,16

METHODS: We applied complementary methods and multiphased design to pinpoint the most likely causal genes for COVID-19 severity. First, we applied cross-methylome omnibus (CMO) test and leveraged data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI) comparing 9,986 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 1,877,672 population controls. Second, we evaluated associations using the complementary S-PrediXcan method and leveraging blood and lung tissue gene expression prediction models. Third, we assessed associations of the identified genes with another COVID-19 phenotype, comparing very severe respiratory confirmed COVID versus population controls. Finally, we applied a fine-mapping method, fine-mapping of gene sets (FOGS), to prioritize putative causal genes. RESULTS: Through analyses of the COVID-19 HGI using complementary CMO and S-PrediXcan methods along with fine-mapping, XCR1, CCR2, SACM1L, OAS3, NSF, WNT3, NAPSA, and IFNAR2 are identified as putative causal genes for COVID-19 severity.

Early identification of risk factors and clinical features is needed to identify critically ill patients, provide suitable treatments, and prevent mortality. Methods We conducted a prospective study on COVID-19 patients referred to a tertiary hospital in Iran between March and November 2020. Of the 3008 patients (mean age 59.3 years, range 1 to 100 years), 1324 were women. We investigated COVID-19 related mortality and its association with clinical features including headache, chest pain, symptoms on CT, hospitalization, time to infection, history of neurological disorders, having a single or multiple risk factors, fever, myalgia, dizziness, seizure, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and anorexia. Findings There was a significant association between COVID-19 mortality and old age, headache, chest pain, respiratory distress, low respiratory rate, oxygen saturation less than 93%, need for a mechanical ventilator, having symptoms on CT, hospitalization, time to infection, history of hypertension, neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases and having a risk factor or multiple risk factors. In contrast, there was no significant association between mortality and gender, fever, myalgia, dizziness, seizure, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and anorexia. Interpretation Our results might help identify early symptoms related to COVID-19 and better manage patients clinically.","Eskandarian, R.; Alizadeh Sani, Z.; Behjati, M.; Zahmatkesh, M.; Haddadi, A.; Kakhi, K.; Roshanzamir, M.; Shoeibi, A.; Alizadehsani, R.; Hussain, S.; Khozeimeh, F.; Keyvani, V.; Khosravi, A.; Nahavandi, S.; Mohammed Shariful Islam, S.",,389,20

In a landscape context, contact opportunities within and between populations are changing rapidly as lockdown measures are relaxed and a number of social activities re-activated. Using an individual-based metapopulation model, we explored the efficacy of different control strategies across an urban–rural gradient in Wales, UK. Our model shows that isolation of symptomatic cases or regional lockdowns in response to local outbreaks have limited efficacy unless the overall transmission rate is kept persistently low. Additional isolation of non-symptomatic infected individuals, who may be detected by effective test-and-trace strategies, is pivotal to reducing the overall epidemic size over a wider range of transmission scenarios. We define an ‘urban–rural gradient in epidemic size' as a correlation between regional epidemic size and connectivity within the region, with more highly connected urban populations experiencing relatively larger outbreaks. For interventions focused on regional lockdowns, the strength of such gradients in epidemic size increased with higher travel frequencies, indicating a reduced efficacy of the control measure in the urban regions under these conditions. When both non-symptomatic and symptomatic individuals are isolated or regional lockdown strategies are enforced, we further found the strongest urban–rural epidemic gradients at high transmission rates. This effect was reversed for strategies targeted at symptomatic individuals only. Our results emphasize the importance of test-and-trace strategies and maintaining low transmission rates for efficiently controlling SARS-CoV-2 spread, both at landscape scale and in urban areas.","Wells, Konstans; Lurgi, Miguel; Collins, Brendan; Lucini, Biagio; Kao, Rowland R.; Lloyd, Alun L.; Frost, Simon D.

Virus-carrying aerosols can penetrate the healthy human body and lungs, resulting in rapid transmission. For the first time, in this evidence-based article, the effects of different types of mouthwashes to reduce the viral load were investigated. Also, another aim of this essay is a reduction in viral load in patients with COVID-19 and prevention developing ventilator-associated pneumonia in critically ill patients. METHODS: Related databases were comprehensively searched for relevant studies. The present study was performed according to the preferred cases for standard systematic reviews (PRISMA). RESULTS: Five original studies in which the subject matter was directly evaluated were included. Different types of mouthwashes and viruses were investigated in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The antiviral mouthwashes play a certainly important role in reducing the viral load of the salivary virus. In the present study, this importance could be proved in two different aspects, that is, the use of mouthwash before dental procedures to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus to the dental team and the use of this mouthwash in COVID-19 patients to help improve systemic problems associated with oral microbial flora.","Moosavi, Mahdieh-Sadat; Aminishakib, Pouyan; Ansari, Maryam",Journal of oral microbiology,389,16

METHODS: We undertook a systematic search of three databases using a tiered search strategy. Studies were included if they: (a) assessed employment conditions such as working hours, precarious employment, contract type, insecurity, and flexible work, or psychosocial workplace exposures such as violence, harassment and bullying, social support, job demand and control, effort-reward imbalance, and organizational justice; (b) included a validated mental health measure; and (c) presented results specific to young people aged ≤ 30 years or were stratified by age group to provide an estimate for young people aged ≤ 30 years. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Exposures (ROBINS-E) tool. RESULTS: Nine studies were included in the review. Four were related to employment conditions, capturing contract type and working hours. Five studies captured concepts relevant to psychosocial workplace exposures including workplace sexual harassment, psychosocial job quality, work stressors, and job control. The quality of the included studies was generally low, with six of the nine at serious risk of bias. Three studies at moderate risk of bias were included in the qualitative synthesis, and results of these showed contemporaneous exposure to sexual harassment and poor psychosocial job quality was associated with poorer mental health outcomes among young workers. Longitudinal evidence showed that exposure to low job control was associated with incident depression diagnosis among young workers. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review illustrate that even better studies are at moderate risk of bias. Addressing issues related to confounding, selection of participants, measurement of exposures and outcomes, and missing data will improve the quality of future research in this area and lead to a clearer understanding of how employment conditions and psychosocial workplace exposures impact the mental health of young people. Generating high-quality evidence is particularly critical given the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on young people’s employment. In preparing for a post-pandemic world where poor-quality employment conditions and exposure to psychosocial workplace exposures may become more prevalent, rigorous research must exist to inform policy to protect the mental health of young workers.

In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of adding high-dose intravenous vitamin C (HDIVC) to the regimens for patients with severe COVID-19 disease. METHODS: An open-label, randomized, and controlled trial was conducted on patients with severe COVID-19 infection. The case and control treatment groups each consisted of 30 patients. The control group received lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine and the case group received HDIVC (6 g daily) added to the same regimen. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between two groups with respect to age and gender, laboratory results, and underlying diseases. The mean body temperature was significantly lower in the case group on the 3rd day of hospitalization (p = 0.001). Peripheral capillary oxygen saturations (SpO(2)) measured at the 3rd day of hospitalization was also higher in the case group receiving HDIVC (p = 0.014). The median length of hospitalization in the case group was significantly longer than the control group (8.5 days vs. 6.5 days) (p = 0.028). There was no significant difference in SpO(2) levels at discharge time, the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and mortality between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find significantly better outcomes in the group who were treated with HDIVC in addition to the main treatment regimen at discharge.

This study sought to assess the volume of missed cancer-related services due to the pandemic. Methods: This case-controlled trial evaluated more than 345,000 oncologic clinic, lab, and radiation appointments from January 1, 2019, through December 31, 2020, and surgery appointments from January 1, 2019, through October 31, 2020. All patients at the Seidman Cancer Center with a cancer diagnosis based on a comprehensive list of 2178 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition (ICD-9) and ICD-10 codes were included in the analysis. Subgroup analyses based on age, race, and sex were also performed. Results: Clinic, lab, and surgical visit cancellations increased by 4.20% (P <.001), 4.84% (P <.001), and 5.22% (P <.001), respectively. In the first 10 months of 2020, there were 703 (9.2%) fewer surgeries compared with the same time period in 2019. The following cancellation rates peaked in March 2020: clinic visits (26.53%), labs (43.66%), surgery (34.00%). Radiation oncology (12.53%) cancellations peaked in April 2020. Prior to the emergence of COVID-19, the group aged 0 to 39 years had the highest clinic cancellation rate (17.85%) compared with patients aged 40 to 64 years (15.95%) and 65 years and older (14.52%; P <.001). Men cancelled (15.63%) significantly more often than women (14.93%; P <.001) in 2019. This reversed during the pandemic: Women (19.56%) cancelled more frequently than men (19.20%; P <.036). Conclusions: There was a large increase in cancelled oncologic care in 2020, which has implications for delayed diagnosis and treatment. This was especially true for patients older than 65 years and for women. These delays could result in patients presenting with more advanced disease, complicating morbidities, and ultimately worse long-term outcomes.","John, Nakayama; Wang, Gi-Ming; Cioffi, Gino; Waite, Kristen; Patil, Nirav; Kyasaram, Ravi; Shanahan, John; Caimi, Paolo; Barnholtz-Sloan, Jill",Oncology (Williston Park),389,0

The mitochondrial antiviral signaling adaptor, MAVS (IPS-1, VISA or Cardif) is critical for host defenses to viral infection by inducing type-1 interferons (IFN-I), however its role in virus-induced apoptotic responses has not been elucidated. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that MAVS causes apoptosis independent of its function in initiating IFN-I production. MAVS-induced cell death requires mitochondrial localization, is caspase dependent, and displays hallmarks of apoptosis. Furthermore, MAVS(−/−) fibroblasts are resistant to Sendai virus-induced apoptosis. A functional screen identifies the hepatitis C virus NS3/4A and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nonstructural protein (NSP15) as inhibitors of MAVS-induced apoptosis, possibly as a method of immune evasion. SIGNIFICANCE: This study describes a novel role for MAVS in controlling viral infections through the induction of apoptosis, and identifies viral proteins which inhibit this host response.","Lei, Yu; Moore, Chris B.; Liesman, Rachael M.; O'Connor, Brian P.; Bergstralh, Daniel T.; Chen, Zhijian J.; Pickles, Raymond J.; Ting, Jenny P.-Y.",PLoS One,389,19

The self-efficacy partially mediates the support and equity relationship with the overall learning. The student with greater self-efficacy will have better overall learning from this e-synchronous teaching methodology. However, content delivery has a stronger role in impacting the overall learning even if there is absence of self-efficacy, thus concluding no mediation.","Kumar, Parul; Kumar, Neha; Ting, Hiram",Curr Psychol,389,5

Clinical-pathological and experimental evidence indicates that MAGI1 expression is decreased in some inflammatory diseases, and also in several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal, cervical, breast, brain, and gastric cancers and appears to act as a tumor suppressor, modulating the activity of oncogenic pathways such as the PI3K/AKT and the Wnt/β-catenin pathways. Genomic mutations and other mechanisms such as mechanical stress or inflammation have been described to regulate MAGI1 expression. Intriguingly, in breast and colorectal cancers, MAGI1 expression is induced by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), suggesting a role in mediating the tumor suppressive activity of NSAIDs. More recently, MAGI1 was found to localize at mature focal adhesion and to regulate integrin-mediated adhesion and signaling in endothelial cells. Here, we review MAGI1′s role as scaffolding protein, recent developments in the understanding of MAGI1 function as tumor suppressor gene, its role in endothelial cells and its implication in cancer and vascular biology.

The COVID‐19 pandemic led to telehealth replacing face‐to‐face care for many surgical consultations across a variety of situations. More evidence is needed regarding patient perceptions of telehealth in surgery, in particular, exploring barriers and facilitators associated with its sustained implementation beyond the pandemic. METHODS: Survey invitations were emailed to a convenience sample of surgical patients by their surgeon following a telehealth consultation during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Surgeons were recruited from a sample (n = 683) who completed a survey on telehealth (distributed via email to all Australian Fellows of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons). Mixed methods analysis was performed of the patient survey data. RESULTS: A total of 1166 consultations were captured: 50% routine reviews, 17% initial appointments and 20% post‐operative reviews. Video‐link was used in 49% of consultations. The majority of patients (94%), were satisfied with the quality of their surgical telehealth consultation and 75% felt it delivered the same level of care as face‐to‐face encounters. Telehealth was convenient to use (96%) and led to cost savings for 60% of patients. When asked about future appointment preferences after the pandemic, 41% indicated they would prefer telehealth (24% video‐link and 17% telephone) over face‐to‐face appointments. There was a perception by patients that telehealth consultation fees should be less than face‐to‐face consultation fees. CONCLUSION: Patient satisfaction with surgical telehealth consultations is high. Barriers to more widespread implementation include financial, clinical appropriateness, technical and confidentiality concerns.","Wiadji, Elvina; Mackenzie, Lisa; Reeder, Patrick; Gani, Jonathan S.; Ahmadi, Sima; Carroll, Rosemary; Smith, Stephen; Frydenberg, Mark; O'Neill, Christine J.",ANZ J Surg,389,16

RESULTS: Significant differences were found in the mean scores for beliefs about the effectiveness of preventative measures, the constructs of the health belief model, and compliance with preventive behaviours relating to the participants’ gender, age, marital status and level of education. Beliefs and intention to stay at home, collectively predicted 54.7% of the variance in preventive behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Although a majority of participants had positive attitudes towards the effectiveness of preventive measures and adhered to them, some people who were not adherent with these healthy behaviours could be key participants in the next wave of the disease.","Kamran, Aziz; Isazadehfar, Khatereh; Heydari, Heshmatolah; Nasimi Doost Azgomi, Ramin; Naeim, Mahdi",BJPsych Open,389,20

Seroprevalence studies have proven an important tool to monitor the progression of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. We present results of consecutive population-based seroprevalence surveys performed in Denmark in 2020. Methods. Invitation letters including a questionnaire covering symptoms were sent to representatively drawn samples of the population in spring, late summer and autumn/winter of 2020. Blood samples from participants taken at public test-centers were analyzed for total Ig and seroprevalence estimates per population segment calculated and compared to other surveillance parameters. Results. From 34,081 participating individuals (response rate 33%), we obtained seroprevalence estimates increasing from 1.1% (95%CI: 0.7%-1.7) in May to 4.0 % (95%CI: 3.4%-4.7%) in December 2020. By December 2020, 1.5% of the population 12 years and older had tested positive by PCR. Seroprevalence estimates were roughly 3 times higher in those aged 12-29 compared to 65+ and higher in metropolitan municipalities. Among seropositives, loss of taste/smell were the more specific symptoms, 32%-56% did not report any symptoms. In half of seroconverted families, we did not see evidence of transmission between generations. Infected individuals in older age groups were hospitalized several fold more often than in younger. Conclusions. Seroprevalence increased during 2020; younger age groups were primarily infected in the autumn/winter surge. Approximately half were asymptomatically infected. Denmark has a high per capita test rate; roughly two undiagnosed infections of COVID-19 were estimated to occur for each diagnosed case. The epidemic appears to have progressed relatively modestly during 2020 in Denmark.","Espenhain, L.; Tribler, S.; Joergensen, C. S.; Holm Hansen, C.; Wolf Sonksen, U.; Ethelberg, S.",,389,24

In this paper, we consider the problem of identifying and tracking communities in graphs that change over time – dynamic community detection – and present a framework based on Riemannian geometry to aid in this task. Our framework currently supports several important operations such as interpolating between and averaging over graph snapshots. We compare these Riemannian methods with entry-wise linear interpolation and find that the Riemannian methods are generally better suited to dynamic community detection. Next steps with the Riemannian framework include producing a Riemannian least-squares regression method for working with noisy data and developing support methods, such as spectral sparsification, to improve the scalability of our current methods.

It has an active IND for COVID-19. Antiviral activities have been found for PT150 and other members of its class in a variety of virus families; thus, it was now tested against SARS-CoV-2 in human bronchial epithelial lining cells and showed effective 90% inhibitory antiviral concentration (EC90) of 5.55 µM. PT150 is a member of an extended platform of novel glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and androgen receptor (AR) modulating molecules. In vivo, their predominant net effect is one of systemic glucocorticoid antagonism, but they also show direct downregulation of AR and minor GR agonism at the cellular level. We hypothesize that anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity depends in part on this AR downregulation through diminished TMPRSS2 expression and modulation of ACE2 activity. Given that hypercortisolemia is now suggested to be a significant co-factor for COVID-19 progression, we also postulate an additive role for its potent immunomodulatory effects through systemic antagonism of cortisol.","Theise, Neil D.; Arment, Anthony R.; Chakravarty, Dimple; Gregg, John M.

Immune correlates of protection are not yet clear. To understand the association between presence and titers of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) with recovery, we screened 82 COVID-19 patients classified in mild (n = 56) and severe (n = 26) disease groups on different days post onset of disease and 27 viral RNA–positive asymptomatic contacts examined within 1 week of the identification of index cases. Of 26 patients with severe disease, six died and 20 recovered. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 NAb levels in plasma and serum were measured using a plaque reduction neutralization test with live virus. The proportion of asymptomatic and symptomatic infections was 1:7.8 in males and 1:1 in females, with males predominating the severe disease group (21/26, 80.7%). At the time of presentation, NAb positivity and titers were comparable among groups with asymptomatic and mild infections. Notably, patients with severe disease exhibited higher NAb seropositivity and titers (25 of 26, 96.2%; 866 ± 188) than those in the mild category (39 of 56, 69.6%; 199 ± 50, P < 0.0001) and asymptomatic individuals (21 of 27, 77.8%; 124 ± 28, P = 0.0002). Within first 2 weeks of onset, NAb titers were significantly higher among patients with severe disease than those with mild presentation. Our data suggest that irrespective of fatal outcome, progression to disease severity was associated with induction of early and high levels of NAb. In our patient series, clinical disease, severity and fatality were predominantly seen in males. The role of NAbs in immunopathogenesis or protection needs to be defined.","Shrivastava, Shubham; Palkar, Sonali; Shah, Jignesh; Rane, Prajakta; Lalwani, Sanjay; Mishra, Akhilesh Chandra; Arankalle, Vidya A.",Am J Trop Med Hyg,389,20

This anxiety is further energised by an AI race narrative that makes people believe they might be missing out. Whether real or not, a belief in this narrative may be detrimental as some stake-holders will feel obliged to cut corners on safety precautions, or ignore societal consequences just to “win”. Starting from a baseline model that describes a broad class of technology races where winners draw a significant benefit compared to others (such as AI advances, patent race, pharmaceutical technologies), we investigate here how positive (rewards) and negative (punishments) incentives may beneficially influence the outcomes. We uncover conditions in which punishment is either capable of reducing the development speed of unsafe participants or has the capacity to reduce innovation through over-regulation. Alternatively, we show that, in several scenarios, rewarding those that follow safety measures may increase the development speed while ensuring safe choices. Moreover, in the latter regimes, rewards do not suffer from the issue of over-regulation as is the case for punishment. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the nature and kinds of regulatory actions most suitable to improve safety compliance in the contexts of both smooth and sudden technological shifts.","Han, The Anh; Pereira, Luís Moniz; Lenaerts, Tom; Santos, Francisco C.",PLoS One,389,26

Methods We identified a non-COVID-19 cohort and patients with suspected COVID-19 with chest CT scans from February 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020. Lungs were segmented, and a mean normal Hounsfield Unit (HU) histogram was generated for the non-COVID-19 CT scans; these were used to define thresholds for designating the COVID-19-suspected histograms as normal or abnormal. Statistical measures were computed and compared to the threshold levels, and density maps were generated to examine the difference between lungs with and without COVID-19 qualitatively. Results The non-COVID-19 cohort consisted of 70 patients with 70 CT scans, and the cohort of suspected COVID-19 patients consisted of 59 patients with 80 CT scans. Sixty-two patients were positive for COVID-19. The mean HUs and skewness of the intensity histogram discriminated between COVID-19 positive and negative cases, with an area under the curve of 0.948 for positive and 0.944 for negative cases. Skewness correctly identified 57 of 62 positive cases, whereas mean HUs correctly identified 17 of 18 negative cases. Density maps allowed for visualization of the temporal evolution of COVID-19 disease. Conclusions The statistical measures and density maps evaluated here could be employed in an automated screening algorithm for COVID-19 infection. The accuracy is high enough for a simple and rapid screening tool for early identification of suspected infection in patients treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy already receiving CT scans as part of clinical care. This screening tool could also identify other infections that present critical risks for patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy, such as pneumonitis.","Tomé, Marie-Hélène; Gjini, Megi; Zhu, Shaoyu; Kabarriti, Rafi; Guha, Chandan; Garg, Madhur K; Tomé, Wolfgang A; Brodin, N.

This led to the suspension of service provision for elective cases. AIM: To assess the potential barriers for resuming the endoscopy service in Egypt. METHODS: A national online survey, four domains, was disseminated over a period of 4 wk in August 2020. The primary outcome of the survey was to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the endoscopy service and barriers to the full resumption of a disabled center(s). RESULTS: A hundred and thirteen Egyptian endoscopy centers participated in the survey. The waiting list was increased by ≥ 50% in 44.9% of areas with clusters of COVID-19 cases (n = 49) and in 35.5% of areas with sporadic cases (n = 62). Thirty nine (34.8%) centers suffered from staff shortage, which was considered a barrier against service resumption by 86.4% of centers in per-protocol analysis. In multivariate analysis, the burden of cases in the unit locality, staff shortage/recovery and the availability of separate designated rooms for COVID-19 cases could markedly affect the resumption of endoscopy practice (P = 0.029, < 0.001 and 0.02, respectively) and Odd’s ratio (0.15, 1.8 and 0.16, respectively).

Yet, as with other types of crises and emergencies, there have been doubts about the extent to which the public are able to engage effectively with the required behaviour. These doubts are based on outdated models of group psychology. AIMS AND ARGUMENT: We analyse the role of group processes in the COVID-19 pandemic in three domains: recognition of threat, adherence by the public to the required public health behaviours (and the factors that increase such adherence) and actions of the many community mutual aid groups that arose during lockdown. In each case, we draw upon the accumulated research on behaviour in emergencies and disasters, as well as the latest findings in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, to show that explanations in terms of social identity processes make better sense of the patterns of evidence than alternative explanations. CONCLUSIONS: If behaviour in the pandemic is a function of mutable group processes rather than fixed tendencies, then behavioural change is possible. There was evidence of significant change in behaviour from the public, particularly in the early days of the pandemic. Understanding the role of group processes means we can help design more effective interventions to support collective resilience in the public in the face of the pandemic and other threats. We draw out from the evidence a set of recommendations on facilitating the public response to COVID-19 by harnessing group processes.","Drury, John; Carter, Holly; Ntontis, Evangelos; Guven, Selin Tekin",BJPsych Open,389,1

In this study, we used an online questionnaire to collect the self-reported skin damages among the first-line medical staff in the epidemic. The questionnaire was designed by four front-line wound care nurses and then revised through Delphi consultants. Items mainly focused on the adverse skin reactions and preventive strategies. The survey was distributed through phone application from March 15(th) to March 20(th) and received 275 responses in total. The prevalence of skin reactions (212, 77.09%) was high in both head and hands. The common clinical symptoms of skin reactions were redness, device-like mark, and burning pain in face; and dryness, dermatitis, and itch/irritation in hands. Three risk factors included gender, level of protection, and daily wearing time of PPE were identified that caused skin reactions among medical staff. 150 of 275 (54.55%) participants took preventive strategies like prophylactic dressings, however, more than 75% users had little knowledge about dressings.

Methods: We developed a mechanistic transmission model to simulate a range of scenarios of COVID-19 spread in the Greater Toronto Area. We estimated healthcare needs against 2019 daily admissions using healthcare administrative data, and applied outputs to hospital-specific data on catchment, capacity, and baseline non-COVID admissions to estimate potential surge by day 90 at two hospitals (St. Michaels Hospital [SMH] and St. Josephs Health Centre [SJHC]). We examined fast/large, default, and slow/small epidemics, wherein the default scenario (R0 2.4) resembled the early trajectory in the GTA. Results: Without further interventions, even a slow/small epidemic exceeded the citys daily ICU capacity for patients without COVID-19. In a pessimistic default scenario, for SMH and SJHC to remain below their non-ICU bed capacity, they would need to reduce non-COVID inpatient care by 70% and 58% respectively. SMH would need to create 86 new ICU beds, while SJHC would need to reduce its ICU beds for non-COVID care by 72%. Uncertainty in local epidemiological features was more influential than uncertainty in clinical severity. If physical distancing reduces contacts by 20%, maximizing the diagnostic capacity or syndromic diagnoses at the community-level could avoid a surge at each hospital. Interpretation: As distribution of the citys surge varies across hospitals over time, efforts are needed to plan and redistribute ICU care to where demand is expected. Hospital-level surge is based on community-level transmission, with community-level strategies key to mitigating each hospitals surge.

Functional inhibition of the acid sphingomyelinase using tricyclic antidepressants prevented infection of epithelial cells, for instance with SARS-CoV-2. The structure of ambroxol, i.e. trans-4-[(2,4-dibromanilin-6-yl)-methyamino]-cyclohexanol, a mucolytic drug applied by inhalation, suggests that the drug might inhibit the acid sphingomyelinase, and thereby infection with SARS-CoV-2. To test this, we used spike protein pseudotyped viral particles (pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike), a bona fide system for mimicking SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. Viral uptake and formation of ceramide localization were determined by fluorescence microscopy, activity of the acid sphingomyelinase by consumption of [(14)C]sphingomyelin and ceramide was quantified by a kinase method. We found that entry of pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike required activation of acid sphingomyelinase and release of ceramide, events that were all prevented by pretreatment with ambroxol. We also obtained nasal epithelial cells from human volunteers prior to and after inhalation of ambroxol. Inhalation of ambroxol reduced acid sphingomyelinase activity in nasal epithelial cells, and prevented pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike-induced acid sphingomyelinase activation, ceramide release, and entry of pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike ex vivo.

As of March 4, 2020, 93090 confirmed cases and 2984 deaths have been reported in more than 80 countries and territories. It has triggered global public health security. However, the features and prognosis of COVID-19 are incompletely understood. CASE SUMMARY: We here report that the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) increased in a confirmed COVID patient. The high level of ESR sustained for a long time even after the patient recovered from COVID-19, while all results related to tumor, tuberculosis, rheumatic diseases, anemia, etc. cannot explain the abnormal elevation of ESR presented in this case. CONCLUSION: Although the increased ESR cannot be explained by all existing evidence, it possibly links the abnormal pathologic change in some COVID-19 patients and negative prognosis, and provides the clue to dissect the mechanism of illness progressing in COVID-19 and its prognosis.","Pu, Sheng-Lan; Zhang, Xiang-Yan; Liu, Dai-Shun; Ye, Ba-Ning; Li, Jian-Quan",World J Clin Cases,389,29

Design: cross- sectional study during April 15-24th in Hospital Costa del Sol (Marbella, Spain), excluding HCW with previous COVID19. Setting: hospital based, focused on patient care areas COVID19. Participants: 498 subjects, 80% women. Participation was offered to all the HCW of Emergencies, Intensive Care and Anesthesia, Internal Medicine and Pneumology. Other units not directly involved in the care of these patients were offered to participate. Intervention: naso and oropharyngeal PCR determination was performed together with IgG and IgM antibody determination by immunochromatography. On the day of sampling, a health questionnaire was answered, reporting symptoms on the same day and in the previous fourteen days. Main outcome measures: percentage of HCW with positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2, percentage of HCW with positive IgG for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Two individuals were detected with PCR for SARS-CoV-2 positive (0.4%). Both were asymptomatic on the day of sampling, but one of them had had a CoVID-19 compatible picture in the previous two weeks and had positive IgG and IgM; therefore, only one subject was truly asymptomatic carrier (0.2%). 9 workers with positive IgG (1.8%) were detected. Conclusions: the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers among health workers of the services directly involved in the care of patients with CoVID-19 was very low in our center. This type of strategy can be one more tool in controlling the pandemic.","Olalla, J.; Correa, A. M.; Martin-Escalante, M. D.; Hortas, M. L.; Martin-Sendarrubias, M.

Although initially administered in the inpatient setting, there has been a growing interest in delivering CAR-T cell therapy in the outpatient setting; however, this has not been adopted as standard clinical practice for multiple reasons, including logistic and reimbursement issues. CAR-T cell therapy requires a multidisciplinary approach and coordination, particularly if given in an outpatient setting. The ability to monitor patients closely is necessary and proper protocols must be established to respond to clinical changes to ensure efficient, effective and rapid evaluation either in the clinic or emergency department for management decisions regarding fever, sepsis, cytokine release syndrome and neurological events, specifically immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome.

Opinions on the suitability of patients with malignancies not undergoing active treatment and in different phases of antineoplastic therapy, to receive influenza vaccination, vary considerably among oncologists, sometimes even within one center. METHODS: We reviewed available data, including recommendations by national health authorities, on impact of influenza in patients with cancer and their capacity to mount protective immunological responses to vaccination, thus allowing, on behalf of Italian Association of Medical Oncology, to make suitable recommendations for the prevention and treatment of seasonal influenza. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Patients with cancer often have disease- or treatment-related immunosuppression, and as a consequence, they may have a suboptimal serologic response to influenza vaccination. The protective effect of the different preparations of influenza vaccines in patients with cancer has not been widely investigated, especially in adult patients harboring solid tumors. The optimal timing for administration of influenza vaccines in patients receiving chemotherapy is also not clearly defined. However, since vaccination is the most effective method, along with antiviral drugs in selected patients, for preventing influenza infection, it has to be recommended for cancer patients. Implementing vaccination of close contacts of oncology patients would be an additional tool for enhancing protection in fragile patient populations.","Pedrazzoli, P.; Baldanti, F.; Donatelli, I.; Castrucci, M.

Purpose: To summarize evidence about the effect of TCZ to treat severe COVID-19. Data sources: PubMed (via MEDLINE), Scopus, and medRxiv repository databases from 1 January to 21 August 2020. Study Selection: Observational studies in any language reporting efficacy and safety outcomes of TCZ use in hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Data Extraction: Independent, dually performed data extraction and quality assessments. Data synthesis: Of 57 eligible studies, 27 were controlled and 30 were not. The overall included patients were 8,128: 4,021 treated with TCZ, in addition to standard of care (SOC), and 4,107 only receiving SOC. The pooled mortality was lower in the TCZ-group vs. the control group, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.73 (95%CI 0.57-0.93; p=0.010). The overall NNT to avoid one death was 20. In hospital wards, patients in the TCZ-group were transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) in a higher proportion than those in the control group; however, ICU mortality of the TCZ-group was lower than in the control group. Secondary infections occurred in a higher proportion in TCZ-treated patients. Among survivors, the length of stay was similar in both groups. Limitations: Conclusions should be considered as weak evidence since they are based on observational studies, most of them retrospective. A variety of factors influencing the indication and effect of TCZ could not be evaluated in-depth. Conclusions: TCZ to seem beneficial in preventing in-hospital mortality in severe, non-critically ill COVID-19 patients. Conversely, patients receiving TCZ appear to be at higher risk for secondary infections, especially those admitted to ICU.","Rubio-Rivas, M.; Mora-Lujan, J. M.; Montero, A.; Homs, N.

METHODS: We compared remdesivir as the treatment for COVID-19 with the treatments in the Turkish treatment guidelines. Analyses were performed using data from 78 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with SpO(2) < 94% who received LFOT in a tertiary healthcare facility. COVID-19 episode costs were calculated for 78 patients considering the cost of modeled remdesivir treatment in the same group from the payer’s perspective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was calculated for remdesivir versus the SoC for the population identified. For Turkey, a reimbursement threshold value between USD 8599 (1 × per capita gross domestic product—GDP) and USD 25.797 (3 × GDP) per QALY was used. RESULTS: In the remdesivir arm, the length of hospital stay (LOS) was 3 days shorter than the SOC. The low ventilator requirement in the remdesivir arm was one factor that decreased the QALY disutility value. In patients who were transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) from the ward, the mean LOS was 17.3 days (SD 13.6), and the mean cost of stay was USD 155.3/day (SD 168.0), while in patients who were admitted to ICU at baseline, the mean LOS was 13.1 days (SD 13.7), and the mean cost of stay was USD 207.9/day (SD 133.6). The mean cost of episode per patient was USD 3461.1 (SD 2259.8) in the remdesivir arm and USD 3538.9 (SD 3296.0) in the SOC arm. Incremental QALYs were estimated at 0.174. Remdesivir treatment was determined to be cost saving vs. SoC. CONCLUSIONS: Remdesivir, which results in shorter LOS and lower rates of intubation requirements in ICU patients than existing therapies, is associated with higher QALYs and lower costs, dominating SoC in patients with SpO(2) < 94% who require oxygen support.

The coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein combines viral genomic RNA into a ribonucleoprotein and protects the viral genome from the host's nucleases. Structurally, the N protein comprises two independent domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) for RNA-binding and C-terminal domain (CTD) involved in RNA-binding, protein dimerization, and nucleocapsid stabilization. The present study explains the structural aspects associated with the involvement of nucleocapsid C-terminal domain in the subunit assembly that helps the RNA binding and further stabilizing the virus assembly by protecting RNA from the hosts exonucleases degradation. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the N-CTD and RNA complex suggests two active sites (site I: a monomer) and (site II: a dimer) with structural stability (RMSD: ~2 Å), Cα fluctuations (RMSF: ~3 Å) and strong protein-ligand interactions were estimated through the SiteMap module of Schrodinger. Virtual screening of 2456 FDA-approved drugs using structure-based docking identified top two leads distinctively against Site-I (monomer): Ceftaroline fosamil (MM-GBSA = −47.12 kcal/mol) and Cefoperazone (−45.84 kcal/mol); and against Site-II (dimer): Boceprevir, (an antiviral protease inhibitor, −106.78 kcal/mol) and Ceftaroline fosamil (−99.55 kcal/mol). The DCCM and PCA of drugs Ceftaroline fosamil (PC1+PC2 = 71.9%) and Boceprevir (PC1 +PC2 = 61.6%) show significant correlated residue motions which suggests highly induced conformational changes in the N-CTD dimer. Therefore, we propose N-CTD as a druggable target with two active binding sites (monomer and dimer) involved in specific RNA binding and stability. The RNA binding site with Ceftaroline fosamil binding can prevent viral assembly and can act as an antiviral for coronavirus.","Chauhan, Arushi; Avti, Pramod; Shekhar, Nishant; Prajapat, Manisha; Sarma, Phulen; Bhattacharyya, Anusuya; Kumar, Subodh; Kaur, Hardeep; Prakash, Ajay; Medhi, Bikash",Comput Biol Med,389,10

There is no highly effective medicine or vaccine, most of the patients were recovered by their own immune response, especially the virus specific IgG and IgM responses. However, the IgG/ IgM responses is barely known. To enable the global understanding of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG/ IgM responses, a SARS-CoV-2 proteome microarray with 18 out of the 28 predicted proteins was constructed. The microarray was applied to profile the IgG/ IgM responses with 29 convalescent sera. The results suggest that at the convalescent phase 100% of patients had IgG/ IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2, especially to protein N, S1 but not S2. S1 purified from mammalian cell demonstrated the highest performance to differentiate COVID-19 patients from controls. Besides protein N and S1, significant antibody responses to ORF9b and NSP5 were also identified. In-depth analysis showed that the level of S1 IgG positively correlate to age and the level of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), especially for women, while the level of S1 IgG negatively correlate to Ly% (Lymphocyte percentage).

Understanding this is crucial to predict pathogen spread and the effectiveness of control efforts. Most analyses of contact patterns to date have focussed on high-income settings. METHODS: Here, we conduct a systematic review and individual-participant meta-analysis of surveys carried out in low- and middle-income countries and compare patterns of contact in these settings to surveys previously carried out in high-income countries. Using individual-level data from 28,503 participants and 413,069 contacts across 27 surveys we explored how contact characteristics (number, location, duration and whether physical) vary across income settings. RESULTS: Contact rates declined with age in high- and upper-middle-income settings, but not in low-income settings, where adults aged 65+ made similar numbers of contacts as younger individuals and mixed with all age-groups. Across all settings, increasing household size was a key determinant of contact frequency and characteristics, but low-income settings were characterised by the largest, most intergenerational households. A higher proportion of contacts were made at home in low-income settings, and work/school contacts were more frequent in high-income strata. We also observed contrasting effects of gender across income-strata on the frequency, duration and type of contacts individuals made. CONCLUSIONS: These differences in contact patterns between settings have material consequences for both spread of respiratory pathogens, as well as the effectiveness of different non-pharmaceutical interventions.

However, the benefit and cost-effectiveness vary in each country or community because they have different standard practices and health care systems. In Japan, rapid antigen tests (RATs) have been frequently used for pediatric respiratory infections. We investigated the impact and cost-effectiveness of a multiplex PCR (mPCR) respiratory panel for pediatric respiratory infections in a Japanese community hospital. METHODS: We replaced RATs with an mPCR respiratory panel (FilmArray®) for admitted pediatric respiratory infections on March 26, 2018. We compared the days of antimicrobial therapy (DOT) and length of stay (LOS) during the mPCR period (March 2018 to April 2019) with those of the RAT period (March 2012 to March 2018). RESULTS: During the RAT and mPCR periods, 1132 and 149 patients were analyzed. The DOT/case was 12.82 vs 8.56 (p < 0.001), and the LOS was 8.18 vs 6.83 days (p = 0.032) in the RAT and mPCR groups, respectively.

The results indicate that a few super-spreaders were more likely to hold certain structural advantages by linking to an exceptional number of other individuals, causing several ongoing transmission events in neighbourhoods without the aid of any intermediary. Thus, the infectious contact network exhibited small-world dynamics characterised by locally clustered contacts exposed to transmission paths via short path lengths. In addition, nosocomial infection analysis shows the pattern of a common-source outbreak followed by secondary person-to-person transmission of the disease.

In addition to the anxiety related to infection risks, trainees have the additional burden of learning and career planning while providing care in an uncertain and rapidly changing environment. We conducted a survey to evaluate the practical and psychosocial impact on radiation oncology fellows during the first month of the pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A 4-part survey was designed and distributed to the fellows in our program. The survey was designed to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on “Scope of activity”, “Well being (Impact on you)”, to identify “Key lessons learned” and “Social factors (About you)” using Likert scales, and open-ended response options. The survey included items from the Oldenburg Burnout questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 17 (71%) participants responded to the survey. While there was a significant reduction in the mean time spent on in-person clinics [13.5 hours/week (pre-COVID) vs 9.3 hours/week (week 3-COVID); p = 0.002]. This was replaced by virtual consults and other COVID related activities. The proportion of respondents demonstrating features of burnout in the domains of “disengagement” and “exhaustion” was 71% and 64% respectively. However, there was also evidence of resilience with 47% respondents “feeling energized”. Top ‘’concerns’’ and ‘’negative changes’’ identified related to learning, infection risk, and safety, patient care, coping, and concerns about their home country. Top ‘’positive changes’’ highlighted include work culture, appreciation for leadership caring for the team, the insistence on evidence to guide change, and the implementation of virtual health care. CONCLUSIONS: Negative impact needs to be anticipated, acknowledged, and managed. We anticipate understanding the positives that have emerged under these extraordinary circumstances is the “silver-lining’’ of the pandemic, giving us tools and the best leverage to plan for the future.","Pilar, Avinash; Gravel, Samuel Bergeron; Croke, Jennifer; Soliman, Hany; Chung, Peter; Wong, Rebecca KS.",Adv Radiat Oncol,389,26

Those born in democratic South Africa, commonly known as the ‘Born Frees’, are perceived to be able to realise equal rights and opportunities, yet many factors constrain their lives. In bringing together approaches to understanding context in health policy and systems research and the social determinants of health, the paper develops a conceptual framework to guide the narrative review examining the key contextual social and structural determinants of adolescent health in South Africa. Illustrative examples drawing from 65 papers from public health and the social sciences describe and link these determinants across micro, meso and macro levels of society, their global determinants, and their intersections with compounding axes of power and inequality. At a micro level individual adolescent sexual and gender identities are expressed through multiple and evolving forms, while they experience growing autonomy and agency, they do so within a broader context characterised by regressive social norms, gender inequality and other intersecting power relationships. At the meso level, organisational and sectoral determinants shape adolescents health and rights, both in being supportive, but they also replicate the biases and inequalities that characterise South African society. In addition, the macro level national and global determinants, such as the structural colonial and apartheid legacies, shape adolescents' health. Despite constitutional and other legislative rights, these determinants and compound economic, geographic, gender and other intersecting inequalities. A key finding is that current experiences and health of adolescents is shaped by past social and structural determinants and power relations, with apartheid inequalities still echoing in the lives of the adolescents, 25 years into democracy. More research and work is needed to provide insights into determinants of adolescent health beyond just the micro level, but also at the interrelated and dynamic meso and macro levels, nested in global determinants. The findings raise critical considerations and implications for understanding the social and structural determinants in the South African context and what this means for adolescent health in the SDG era.","Jacobs, Tanya; George, Asha",Global Health,389,16

Mechanistic models were substantially more accurate when forecasting influenza A positive POC data than total specimen POC data, especially at longer lead times. Also, models that fit subpopulations of the cluster (individual counties) separately were better able to forecast clusters than were models that directly fit to aggregated cluster data. Public health authorities may wish to consider developing forecasting pipelines for type-specific POC data in addition to ILI data. Simple mechanistic models will likely improve forecast accuracy when applied at small spatial scales to pathogen-specific data before being scaled to larger geographical units and broader syndromic data. Highly local forecasts may enable new public health messaging to encourage at-risk individuals to temporarily reduce their social mixing during seasonal peaks and guide public health intervention policy during potentially severe novel influenza pandemics.","Turtle, James; Riley, Pete; Ben-Nun, Michal; Riley, Steven",PLoS Comput Biol,389,16

We highlight recent developments in three promising areas of telemedicine: teleconsultation, telemonitoring, and teletreatment. We illustrate this using Parkinson's disease as a model for other chronic neurological disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: Teleconsultations can reliably administer parts of the neurological examination remotely, but are typically not useful for establishing a reliable diagnosis. For follow-ups, teleconsultations can provide enhanced comfort and convenience to patients, and provide opportunities for blended and proactive care models. Barriers include technological challenges, limited clinician confidence, and a suboptimal clinician-patient relationship. Telemonitoring using wearable sensors and smartphone-based apps can support clinical decision-making, but we lack large-scale randomized controlled trials to prove effectiveness on clinical outcomes. Increasingly many trials are now incorporating telemonitoring as an exploratory outcome, but more work remains needed to demonstrate its clinical meaningfulness. Finding a balance between benefits and burdens for individual patients remains vital. Recent work emphasised the promise of various teletreatment solutions, such as remotely adjustable deep brain stimulation parameters, virtual reality enhanced exercise programs, and telephone-based cognitive behavioural therapy. Personal contact remains essential to ascertain adherence to teletreatment. SUMMARY: The availability of different telemedicine tools for remote consultation, monitoring, and treatment is increasing. Future research should establish whether telemedicine improves outcomes in routine clinical care, and further underpin its merits both as intervention and outcome in research settings.","van den Bergh, Robin; Bloem, Bastiaan R.; Meinders, Marjan J.; Evers, Luc J.W.",Curr Opin Neurol,389,4

This study explored perspectives of California dental providers and oral health literacy experts in the United States on use of communication techniques. We conducted a qualitative key informant interview study with 50 participants between November 2019 and March 2020, including 44 dental providers (dentists, hygienists, and assistants) in public or private practice in California and 6 oral health literacy (OHL) experts. We undertook thematic analysis of interview transcripts and descriptive statistics about interviewees from pre-surveys. Dental providers reported frequently speaking slowly, and using simple language and models/radiographs to communicate with patients, while infrequently using interpretation/translation, illustrations, teach-back, or motivational interviewing. Providers reported using only 6 of the 18 American Medical Association’s (AMA) recommended communication techniques and only 3 of the 7 AMA’s basic communication techniques. A majority of providers indicated using one of five oral health assessment and educational strategies. Key barriers to effective communication included limited time, financial incentives promoting treatment over prevention, lack of OHL training, limited plain-language patient education materials, and patients with low OHL knowledge. Dental organizations should prioritize supporting dental providers in effective patient communication practices. Standardizing OHL continuing education, creating an evidence-based OHL toolkit for dental teams, ensuring accessible interpretation/translation services, and incentivizing dental providers to deliver education could improve oral health literacy and outcomes.","Tseng, Winston; Pleasants, Elizabeth; Ivey, Susan L.; Sokal-Gutierrez, Karen; Kumar, Jayanth; Hoeft, Kristin S.; Horowitz, Alice M.; Ramos-Gomez, Francisco; Sodhi, Miku; Liu, Jessica; Neuhauser, Linda",Int J Environ Res Public Health,389,16

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical and toxic effects of the individual ingredients checked against those listed in ToxBase, the National Poisons Information Service’s poisons database. RESULTS: The medicine contained 34 ingredients. The most common toxic effect identified on ToxBase was nausea and vomiting (16 ingredients, 47%). Potentially life threatening effects were associated with 13 (38%) ingredients, including depression of the central nervous system, kidney injury, convulsions, cardiac toxicity, and mucosal erosion. The effects described in the book were accurate initially but then diverted from the most likely clinical outcome (death). CONCLUSIONS: Although Dahl ought to be applauded for his initial accuracy about the toxicology of the ingredients in George’s marvellous medicine, the overall effect would be fatal catastrophic physiological collapse.

The population was generally susceptible. However, reports on pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were very limited. By sharing the clinical characteristics, treatments and outcomes of 18 patients with COVID-19 during late pregnancy, we hope to provide some references for obstetric treatment and management. METHODS: A total of 18 patients with COVID-19 treated at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were collected. The epidemiological characteristics, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, chest CT and pregnancy outcomes were performed for analysis. RESULTS: 1. 18 cases of late pregnancy infected with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were delivered at 35 (+ 5) weeks to 41 weeks. According to the clinical classification of COVID-19, 1 case was mild type, 16 cases were ordinary type, and 1 case was severe type. 2. According to imaging examinations: 15 (83%) cases showed unilateral or bilateral pneumonia, 2 (11%) cases had pulmonary infection with pleural effusion, and 1 (6%) case had no abnormal imaging changes. 8 (44%) cases were positive and 10 (56%) cases were negative for nasopharyngeal-swab tests of SARS-CoV-2. 3. Among the 18 newborns, there were 3 (17%) premature infants, 1 (6%) case of mild asphyxia, 5 (28%) cases of bacterial pneumonia, 1 (6%) case of gastrointestinal bleeding, 1 (6%) case of necrotizing enteritis, 2 (11%) cases of hyperbilirubinemia and 1 (6%) case of diarrhea. All the newborns were negative for the first throat swab test of SARS-CoV-2 after birth. 4. Follow-up to Mar 7, 2020, no maternal and neonatal deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients in late term pregnancy with COVID-19 were of ordinary type, and they were less likely to develop into critical pneumonia after early isolation and antiviral treatment. Vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was not detected, but the proportion of neonatal bacterial pneumonia was higher than other neonatal diseases in newborns.","Zhang, Lu; Dong, Lan; Ming, Lei; Wei, Min; Li, Jun; Hu, Ruheng; Yang, Jing",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,389,17

Methods: Ecological study using data at the municipality level, as units of analysis. COVID-19 data were obtained from official reports up to and including July 17th, 2020. PM2.5 long-term exposure was defined as the 2014-2018 average of the estimated concentrations at municipalities obtained from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service Reanalysis (CAMSRA) model. We fit a logit-negative binomial hurdle model for the mortality rate adjusting for sociodemographic and health conditions. Results: Estimated mortality rate ratios (MRR) for long-term average PM2.5 were not statistically significant in either of the two components of the hurdle model (i.e., the likelihood of reporting at least one death or the count of fatal cases). We found that having 10% or more of the population over 65 years of age (MRR=3.91 95%CI 2.24-6.81), the poverty index (MRR=1.03 95%CI 1.01-1.05), and the prevalence of hypertension over 6% (MRR=1.32 95%CI1.03-1.68) are the main factors associated with death rate at the municipality level. Having a higher hospital beds capacity is inversely correlated to mortality. Conclusions: There was no evidence of an association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and mortality rate at the municipality level in Colombia.

We performed a retrospective analysis to evaluate outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting from delayed diagnosis, staging, and treatment of bladder cancer. We showed that the COVID-19 pandemic led to a deferred oncological diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer. More attention is required to avoid adverse outcomes, with increased rates of advanced and aggressive tumors in patients with primary bladder cancer. Moreover, timely treatment is compulsory in those patients. ABSTRACT: Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19)-induced effects on deferred diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer (BC) patients are currently not clarified. The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic by considering its effects on tumor stage and grade, and to create feasible clinical triage decisions. A retrospective single-center analysis of all patients who underwent diagnostic and surgical procedures due to BC, during January 2019 and December 2020, was performed. Due to COVID-19 lockdowns, significantly fewer (diagnostic and therapeutic) endoscopic procedures were performed in the first 6 months of 2020 compared to 2019 (p = 0.002). In patients with a primary diagnosis of BC, a significant increase of high-grade tumors (p < 0.001), as well as advanced tumor stages (p = 0.014), were noticed during 2020 in comparison to 2019. On the contrary, patients with recurrent BC undergoing risk-adapted surveillance, depending on previous tumor histology, showed no adverse outcomes regarding tumor stage and grade when comparing the pre COVID-19 era with 2020. Thus, more awareness in clinical urologic practice is mandatory to avoid adverse consequences, with increased rates of advanced and aggressive tumors in patients with primary BC. In recurrent BC, an individual risk stratification in order to avoid worse outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be justified.","Tulchiner, Gennadi; Staudacher, Nina; Fritz, Josef; Radmayr, Christian; Culig, Zoran; Horninger, Wolfgang; Pichler, Renate",Cancers (Basel),389,5

While people of all ages, occupations, and communities are at risk of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2, the health care workers (HCWs) are possibly at the highest risk. Most seroprevalence surveys with HCWs conducted worldwide have been limited to Europe, North America, and East Asia. We aimed to understand how the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies varied across these geographic regions among HCWs based on the available evidences. METHODS: By searching through PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases, eligible studies published from January 1, 2020 to January 15, 2021 were included for the systematic review and meta-analysis. The random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled proportion of IgG seropositive HCWs. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plot and confirmed by Egger's test. Heterogeneity was quantified using I(2) statistics. We performed sensitivity analyses based on sample size, diagnostic method and publication status. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020219086). FINDINGS: A total of 53 peer-reviewed articles were selected, including 173,353 HCWs (32.7% male) from the United States, ten European, and three East Asian countries. The overall seropositive prevalence rate of IgG antibodies was 8.6% in these regions (95% CI= 7.2–9.9%). Pooled seroprevalence of IgG antibodies was higher in studies conducted in the USA (12.4%, 95% CI= 7.8–17%) than in Europe (7.7%, 95% CI=6.3–9.2%) and East Asia (4.8%, 95% CI=2.9–6.7%). The subgroup study also estimated that male HCWs had 9.4% (95% CI= 7.2–11.6%) IgG seroconversion, and female HCWs had 7.8% (95% CI=5.9–9.7%). The study exhibits a high prevalence of IgG antibodies among HCWs under 40 years in the USA, conversely, it was high in older HCWs (≥40 years of age) in Europe and East Asia. In the months February-April 2020, the estimated pooled seroprevalence was 5.7% (4.0–7.4%) that increased to 8·2% (6.2–10%) in April-May and further to 9.9% (6.9–12.9%) in the May-September time-period. INTERPRETATION: In the view of all evidence to date, a significant variation in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs is observed in regions of Europe, the United States, and East Asia. The patterns of IgG antibodies by time, age, and gender suggest noticeable regional differences in transmission of the virus. Based on the insights driven from the analysis, priority is required for effective vaccination for older HCWs from Europe and East Asia. A considerable high seroprevalence of IgG among HCWs from the USA suggests a high rate of past infection that indicates the need to take adequate measures to prevent hospital spread. Moreover, the seroprevalence trend was not substantially changed after May 2020, suggesting a slow progression of long-term SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Routine testing of HCWs for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered even after the rollout of vaccination to identify the areas of increased transmission.

Among the detected viruses, 64.2% of the cases were due to a single‐virus infection and 35.8% were due to the coinfections with up to four viruses. The most common respiratory virus was influenza A, followed by non‐MERS human coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, and influenza B.

People with dementia were significantly and disproportionally affected at the height of the pandemic in England. Community pharmacies in England continued to operate during the pandemic but had to adjust the way they provided key healthcare services. The impact of these changes on the provision of medication services to people with dementia is underexplored. OBJECTIVE: To explore the experiences of the community pharmacy team in supporting people with dementia and family carers manage medications during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An interpretivist/constructivist research paradigm was used; semi-structured one-to-one telephone interviews were conducted with any member of the community pharmacy team who had been involved in providing medication services to people with dementia in England before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment took place between July and August 2020. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Fourteen participants were interviewed with equal numbers of qualified pharmacists and non-pharmacist staff. Participants were in their role for an average of 4.5 years. The analysis of interviews generated three themes: 1) key interactions curtailed due to COVID-19 restrictions, 2) utilising resources within and outside of the pharmacy to provide tailored services for people with dementia, and 3) the interplay between professional duty and personal values underpinned decisions to provide medication services. CONCLUSIONS: The study provided a unique and important first insights to our understanding of how the community pharmacy team in England supported people with dementia and their family carers during the COVID-19 pandemic. These insights provide opportunities for reflection by individuals, healthcare teams, healthcare organisations, policy makers and the public, in an international context, to enable long-term planning, investment and implementation of strategies beyond the current pandemic.","Rosemary HM Lim, Dr; Shalhoub, Reem; Sridharan, Barati Keshine",Res Social Adm Pharm,389,16

Even in developed countries, infectious enteritis is second only to respiratory infections as a cause of morbidity in early childhood. Objective: To nominate the various viral agents that cause enteritis, discuss the pathogenesis, clinical features, epidemiology and diagnostic procedures employed. Study design: Pertinent literature was reviewed and the findings of investigations carried out on viral enteritis by various colleagues recalled. Results: The viruses causing gastroenteritis include: Rotaviruses; Adenoviruses-especially Ad 31, Ad 40 and Ad 41; members of the Caliciviridae, e.g. Norwalk virus, Hawaii virus, Snow Mountain virus, Taunton virus, Southampton virus, Toronto virus (formerly mini-reovirus) and others; Astrovirus; Coronavirus; Torovirus; Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and possibly Picobirnavirus. Enteritis-producing viruses replicate in columar epithelial cells in the distal parts of villi of the small intestine. Two mechanisms are addressed to explain why diarrhea occurs. Clinically, the main expression of illness is a watery diarrhea that lasts 24 h to about 7 days. Vomiting is of shorter duration and may not always accompany the diarrhea. Fever is generally ⩽ 38.5°C. Virus is shed in the stool for about 3–7 days. Diagnostic procedures employ electron microscopy (EM), immune electron microscopy (IEM), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay (TR-FIA), latex agglutination, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Conclusion: In developed countries viral enteritis among young children may be up to three times more common than bacterial gut disease. With the exception of CMV enteric involvement, the stool is characteristically not bloody and white blood cells are not found.

Due to the overwhelming prevalence and incidence rates of HIV, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, it is necessary to develop new and affordable treatments. AIM OF THE STUDY: The article provides an extensive overview of the status on investigation of plants from the southern African region with ethnobotanical use for treating HIV or HIV-related symptoms, or the management of HIV. The review also provide an account of the in vitro assays, anti-viral activity and phytochemistry of these plants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peer-reviewed articles investigating plants with ethnobotanical information for the treatment or management of HIV or HIV-related symptoms from the southern African region were acquired from Science Direct, PubMed central and Google Scholar. The selection criteria was that (1) plants should have a record of traditional/popular use for infectious or viral diseases, HIV treatment or symptoms similar to HIV infection, (2) if not traditionally/popularly used, plants should be closely related to plants with popular use and HIV activity identified by means of in vitro assays, (3) plants should have been identified scientifically, (4) should be native to southern African region and (5) anti-HIV activity should be within acceptable ranges. RESULTS: Many plants in Africa and specifically the southern African region have been used for the treatment of HIV or HIV related symptoms and have been investigated suing various in vitro techniques. In vitro assays using HIV enzymes such as reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase (IN) and protease (PR), proteins or cell-based assays have been employed to validate the use of these plants with occasional indication of the selectivity index (SI) or therapeutic index (TI), with only one study, that progressed to in vivo testing. The compounds identified from plants from southern Africa is similar to compounds identified from other regions of the world, and the compounds have been divided into three groups namely (1) flavonoids and flavonoid glycosides, (2) terpenoids and terpenoid glycosides and (3) phenolic acids and their conjugated forms. CONCLUSIONS: An investigation of the plants from southern Africa with ethnobotanical use for the treatment of HIV, management of HIV or HIV-related symptoms, therefore provide a very good analysis of the major assays employed and the anti-viral compounds and compound groups identified. The similarity in identified anti-viral compounds worldwide should support the progression from in vitro studies to in vivo testing in development of affordable and effective anti-HIV agents for countries with high infection and mortality rates due to HIV/AIDS.","Prinsloo, Gerhard; Marokane, Cynthia K.; Street, Renée A.",J Ethnopharmacol,389,20

We developed a sensitive, high-throughput, and efficient assay using liquid bead array technology. We observed advantages over traditional ELISA for the detection and quantification of binding IgG against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. To determine whether COVID-19 symptom severity correlates with SARS-CoV-2 IgG, we measured anti-RBD IgG levels from 67 subjects recovered from PCR-confirmed COVID-19. We found that COVID-19 symptom severity strongly correlated with RBD IgG level (p < 0.001). These findings have substantial implications for public policy surrounding assessments of antibody responses and possible immunity, as not all cases of COVID-19 can be assumed to generate a protective antibody response, and mild disease in particular is capable of generating very low-level anti-RBD IgG levels. These findings also have important implications for the selection of donors for convalescent plasma to be used therapeutically.","Bennett, Monique; Yoder, Sandra; Brady, Eric; Pulley, Jill M.; Rhoads, Jillian P.; Stewart, Thomas G.; Bernard, Gordon R.; Creech, C.

Globally, the number of reported confirmed cases has exceeded 84.3 million as of this writing (January 2, 2021). Since there are no targeted therapies for COVID-19, the current focus is the repurposing of drugs approved for other uses. In some clinical trials, antiviral drugs such as remdesivir (Grein et al., 2020), lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) (Cao et al., 2020), chloroquine (Gao et al., 2020), hydroxychloroquine (Gautret et al., 2020), arbidol (Wang et al., 2020), and favipiravir (Cai et al., 2020b) have shown efficacy in COVID-19 patients. LPV/r combined with arbidol, which is the basic regimen in some regional hospitals in China including Zhejiiang Province, has shown antiviral effects in COVID-19 patients (Guo et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020).

San Francisco Adult Protective Services (APS) caseworkers conducted phone interviews with clients or collaterals (client’s family, trusted other, or service provider) to inquire about clients’ awareness of COVID-19 and unmet needs. Nine-hundred-and-thirty-four (71%) of 1,313 APS’ past clients or their collaterals were interviewed, with 741 (79%) responding positively to COVID-19-awareness questions, and 697 (75%) having no unmet needs. Binary logistic regression with Firth adjusted maximum likelihood estimation method revealed that older persons (p < .05), self-neglectors (p < .05), and victims of neglect (p < .05) were less aware of COVID-19. Unmet needs varied by mistreatment type. Victims of isolation were more likely to have medical needs (p < .05), while victims of emotional abuse were more likely to report loneliness (p < .001). Case notes reflected clients who were well-prepared for the pandemic, versus those who required additional assistance to follow preventative measures of the COVID-19 pandemic to stay home. Although the majority of San Francisco APS’ past clients experienced no unmet needs at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the prolonged length and intensity of the pandemic could have exacerbated this vulnerable group’s situation. Collaboration between service providers is key in assisting victims experiencing unmet needs to live safely in a public health crisis, especially underserved victims of specific ethnic backgrounds.","Liu, Pi-Ju; Wang, Aining; Schwab-Reese, Laura M.; Stratton, Sara K.",J Fam Violence,389,29

Whether these patterns were present in public hospitals is unknown. The aim of this brief study was to investigate COVID-19 hospitalizations and outcomes in the public health system during the initial pandemic response. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on COVID-19 admissions in New York City public hospitals during the exponential phase of the pandemic. All data were collected from an integrated electronic medical records system (Epic Health Systems, Verona, WI). Overall, 5,422 patients with at least one admission each for COVID-19 were reviewed, with a study of demographic characteristics (including age, gender, race, BMI), pregnancy status, comorbidities, facility activity, and outcomes. Data related to hospitalization and mortality trends were also collected from City of New York website. These data often involved more than one facility and/or service line resulting in more location or treatment facility counts than patients due to utilization of services at more than one location and transfers between locations and facilities. Results: Higher mortality was associated with increasing age with the highest death rate (51.9%) noted in the age group >75 years (OR 7.88, 95%CI 6.32–10.08). Comorbidities with higher mortality included diabetes (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.33–1.70), hypertension (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.44–1.83), cardiovascular conditions (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.47–1.87), COPD (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.39–2.50). It was deduced that 20% of all New York City COVID-19 positive admissions were in public health system during this timeframe. A high proportion of admissions (21.26%) and deaths (19.93%) were at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens. Bellevue and Metropolitan Hospitals had the lowest number of deaths, both in borough of Manhattan. Mortality in public hospitals in Brooklyn was 29.9%, Queens 28.1%, Manhattan 20.4%. Conclusion: Significant variations existed in COVID-19 hospitalizations and outcomes in the public health system in New York City during the initial pandemic. Although outcomes are worse with older age and those with comorbidities, variations in hospitals and boroughs outside of Manhattan are targets to investigate and strategize efforts.","Dinesh, Anant; Mallick, Taha; Arreglado, Tatiana M.; Altonen, Brian L.; Engdahl, Ryan",Front Public Health,389,16

AIM: Delineation of individual strategies of the members of the Society for Pediatric Rheumatology (GKJR) in cases of COVID-19. METHODS: In May 2020 all GKJR members were invited to take part in an online survey. Opinion data regarding an approach using disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) in cases of COVID-19 as well as the readiness to use new therapeutic agents in patients in different stages of the disease were collected. RESULTS: A total of 71 respondents (27.3% of all contacted pediatric rheumatologists) took part in the survey. Of these 28.2% had treated patients with COVID-19. Over 95% of the respondents did not support a preventive adaptation of the anti-rheumatic treatment during the SARS-CoV‑2 pandemic. In the case of outpatients under immunosuppression with proven COVID-19 more than 50% of the respondents would refrain from administering intravenous high-dose steroids, cyclophosphamide, anti-CD20 antibodies as well as BAFF, CTLA‑4 and TNF-alpha blockades. Conversely, >70% of the respondents would continue the treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), oral steroids, mycophenolate, IL‑1 blockade and immunoglobulins (Ig). In the case of inpatients 74.6% of respondents would consider targeted COVID-19 treatment. In stable patients with oxygen treatment (stage I) HCQ (18.3%), azithromycin (16.9%) and Ig (9.9%) were most frequently used. In cases of early signs (stage II) or a manifest cytokine storm (stage III) anakinra (40.8% for stage II and 46.5% for stage III), tocilizumab (26.8% and 40.8%, respectively), steroids (25.4% and 33.8%, respectively) and remdesivir (29.6% and 38.0%, respectively) were most frequently used. The need for a personalized approach based on the current clinical situation was emphasized by many respondents. CONCLUSION: The currently low prevalence of COVID-19 in Germany limits the general clinical experience. Therefore, the presented results have to be interpreted with caution and mostly as hypothetical treatment considerations. It is to be expected that there will always be a limited amount of evidence on pediatric COVID-19; therefore, a continuous and critical exchange of expert opinions on the treatment strategies is important.","Janda, A.; Schuetz, C.; Heeg, M.; Minden, K.; Hedrich, C.

The study investigates the impact of the outbreak on respiratory physicians’ work over time and identifies problems to be addressed in the future. METHODS: We conducted a web-based survey of respiratory physicians in 848 institutions. The survey comprised 32 questions and four sections: Survey 1 (April 20, 2020), Survey 2 (May 27, 2020), Survey 3 (August 31, 2020), and Survey 4 (December 4, 2020). RESULTS: The mean survey response rate was 24.9%, and 502 facilities (59.2%) participated in at least one survey. The proportion of facilities that could perform PCR tests for diagnosis and more than 20 tests per day gradually increased. The percentage capable of managing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or more than five ventilators did not increase over time. The proportion that reported work overload of 150% or more, stress associated with lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), and harassment or stigma in the surrounding community did not sufficiently improve. CONCLUSION: While there was an improvement in expanding the examination system and medical cooperation in the community, there was no indication of enhancement of the critical care management system. The overwork of respiratory physicians, lack of PPE, and harassment and stigma related to COVID-19 did not sufficiently improve and need to be addressed urgently.","Kamada, Keisuke; Konno, Satoshi; Kaneko, Takeshi; Fukunaga, Koichi; Hasegawa, Yoshinori; Yokoyama, Akihito",Respir Investig,389,26

To this end, we have developed an evidence based quantitative mechanistic mathematical model. The model explicitly tracks the dynamics of contact and airborne transmission between individuals indoors, and was validated against the observed fundamental attributes of the epidemic, the secondary attack rate (SAR) and serial interval distribution. Using the model we identified the dominant driver of pre-symptomatic transmission, which was found to be contact route, while the contribution of the airborne route is negligible. We provide evidence that a combination of rather easy to implement measures of frequent hand washing, cleaning fomites and avoiding physical contact decreases the risk of infection by an order of magnitude, similarly to wearing masks and gloves.","Arav, Y.; Klausner, Z.; Fattal, E.",,389,24

Despite the abundance of new studies, privacy laws prevent their dissemination for medical investigations: through clinical de-identification, the Protected Health Information (PHI) contained therein can be anonymized so that medical records can be shared and published. The automation of clinical de-identification through deep learning techniques has proven to be less effective for languages other than English due to the scarcity of data sets. Hence a new Italian de-identification data set has been created from the COVID-19 clinical records made available by the Italian Society of Radiology (SIRM). Therefore, two multi-lingual deep learning systems have been developed for this low-resource language scenario: the objective is to investigate their ability to transfer knowledge between different languages while maintaining the necessary features to correctly perform the Named Entity Recognition task for de-identification. The systems were trained using four different strategies, using both the English Informatics for Integrating Biology & the Bedside (i2b2) 2014 and the new Italian SIRM COVID-19 data sets, then evaluated on the latter. These approaches have demonstrated the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer learning to de-identify medical records written in a low resource language such as Italian, using one with high resources such as English.","Catelli, Rosario; Gargiulo, Francesco; Casola, Valentina; De Pietro, Giuseppe; Fujita, Hamido; Esposito, Massimo",Appl Soft Comput,389,24

Here we evaluated a panel of biomarkers to phenotype patients and to define the role of immuno-inflammatory mediators as biomarkers of severity. Materials and methods Serum samples were obtained from 24 COVID-19 patients on admission to hospital, before any treatment or infusion of intravenous steroids or invasive ventilation. KL-6 IL-6 and C-peptide were measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay. IL-6 assay was validated for accuracy and precision. The validity of variables used to distinguish severe from mild-to-moderate patients was assessed by areas under curves (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and logistic regression was performed to combine parameters of the two groups. Results In the severe group, IL-6, CRP and KL-6 concentrations were significantly higher than in mild-to-moderate patients. KL-6, IL-6 and CRP concentrations were directly correlated with each other. ROC curve analysis of the logistic regression model including IL-6, KL-6 and CRP showed the best performance with an AUC of 0.95. Conclusions Besides corroborating previous reports of over-expression of IL-6 in severe COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation, analytical determination of other mediators showed that IL-6 concentrations were correlated with those of KL-6 and CRP. The combination of these three prognostic bioindicators made it possible to distinguish severe COVID-19 patients with poor prognosis from mild-to-moderate patients.","Bergantini, L.; Bargagli, E.; d'Alessandro, M.; Refini, R.

Methods Preliminary cross-sectional data were analysed from a cohort study (n=4,378). Clinical and non-clinical staff of three London-based NHS Trusts (UK), including acute and mental health Trusts, took part in an online baseline survey. The primary outcome measure used is the presence of probable common mental disorders (CMDs), measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Secondary outcomes are probable anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) (PCL-6), suicidal ideation (CIS-R), and alcohol use (AUDIT). Moral injury is measured using the Moray Injury Event Scale (MIES). Results Analyses showed substantial levels of CMDs (58.9%, 95%CI 58.1 to 60.8), and of PTSD (30.2%, 95%CI 28.1 to 32.5) with lower levels of depression (27.3%, 95%CI 25.3 to 29.4), anxiety (23.2%, 95%CI 21.3 to 25.3), and alcohol misuse (10.5%, 95%CI, 9.2 to 11.9). Women, younger staff, and nurses tended to have poorer outcomes than other staff, except for alcohol misuse. Higher reported exposure to moral injury (distress resulting from violation of one's moral code) was strongly associated with increased levels of CMDs, anxiety, depression, PTSD symptoms, and alcohol misuse.

Various propagation simulation models have been proposed to predict the spread of the epidemic and the effectiveness of related control measures. These models play an indispensable role in understanding the complex dynamic situation of the epidemic. Most existing work studies the spread of epidemic at two levels including population and agent. However, there is no comprehensive statistical analysis of community lockdown measures and corresponding control effects. This paper performs a statistical analysis of the effectiveness of community lockdown based on the Agent-Level Pandemic Simulation (ALPS) model. We propose a statistical model to analyze multiple variables affecting the COVID-19 pandemic, which include the timings of implementing and lifting lockdown, the crowd mobility, and other factors. Specifically, a motion model followed by ALPS and related basic assumptions is discussed first. Then the model has been evaluated using the real data of COVID-19.

Therefore, we systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the chest CT imaging signature of COVID-19. Methods A systematic literature search was performed for original studies on chest CT findings in patients with COVID-19. Methodological quality of studies was evaluated. Pooled prevalences of chest CT findings were calculated using a random effects model in case of between-study heterogeneity (predefined as I2≥50), otherwise a fixed effects model was used. Results Twenty-eight studies were included. Median number of COVID-19 patients per study was 124 (range 50-476), comprising a total of 3,466 patients. Median prevalence of symptomatic patients was 99% (range >76.3%-100%). 27/28 (96%) of studies had a retrospective design. Methodological quality concerns were present with either risk of or actual referral bias (13 studies), patient spectrum bias (8 studies), disease progression bias (26 studies), observer variability bias (27 studies), and test review bias (14 studies). Pooled prevalence was 10.6% for normal chest CT findings. Pooled prevalences were 90.0% for posterior predilection, 81.0% for ground-glass opacity, 75.8% for bilateral abnormalities, 73.1% for left lower lobe involvement, 72.9% for vascular thickening, and 72.2% for right lower lobe involvement. Pooled prevalences were 5.2% for pleural effusion, 5.1% for lymphadenopathy, 4.1% for airway secretions/tree-in-bud sign, 3.6% for central lesion distribution, 2.7% for pericardial effusion, and 0.7% for cavitation/cystic changes. Pooled prevalences of other CT findings ranged between 10.5%-63.2%. Conclusion Studies on chest CT findings in COVID-19 suffer from methodological quality concerns.

RECENT FINDINGS: Human STH infections in middle- and high-income countries are at particular risk for being undiagnosed; as common symptoms are non-specific, differentials require a high index of clinical suspicion, and cases are concentrated in areas of poverty where access to care is limited. Although autochthonous STHs are thought to be rare in the USA, infections were once common in the American South and Appalachia and robust epidemiologic surveillance is limited post 1980s. However, recent community studies and case reports from small-scale farms and areas of high rural or inner-city poverty reveal the potential for persisting helminth infections in distinct populations of the country. SUMMARY: STHs are among the most common neglected tropical diseases globally causing significant morbidity in underserved communities and contributing to the continuation of cycles of poverty within vulnerable populations. Due to possible severe disease sequalae and their ability to perpetuate poverty and poverty-associated health outcomes within already vulnerable groups, it is vital that surveillance for these infections is enhanced to bolster health equity in the USA.","Lynn, Mary K.; Morrissey, Josephine A.; Conserve, Donaldson F.",Curr Trop Med Rep,389,22

Older adults and patients with comorbidities and immunosuppressive conditions may experience severe signs and symptoms that can lead to death. This case series assesses the clinical course, imaging features, and outcomes for 12 patients with COVID-19 and a history of kidney transplantation. Patients were evaluated for symptoms, laboratory data, imaging findings, and outcomes from February 2020 to April 2020. Fever, cough, and dyspnea were the most common clinical symptoms, noted in 75% (nine/12), 75% (nine/12), and 41.7% (five/12) of the patients, respectively. Most of the patients had a normal white blood cell count, while 33.3% (four/12) had leukopenia and 8.3% (one/12) had leukocytosis. A combination of consolidation and ground glass opacity was the most predominant (75%) pattern of lung involvement on computed tomography (CT). Eight patients died of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome and four were discharged. All recovered cases had a unilateral peripheral pattern of involvement limited to only one zone on initial chest CT. It seems that CT imaging has an important role in predicting COVID-19 outcomes for solid organ transplant recipients. Future studies with long-term follow up and more cases are needed to elucidate COVID-19 diagnosis, outcome, and management strategies for these patients.","Abrishami, Alireza; Samavat, Shiva; Behnam, Behdad; Arab-Ahmadi, Mehran; Nafar, Mohsen; Sanei Taheri, Morteza",Eur Urol,389,1

This study aimed to evaluate the dynamics of the evolution of new community cases, and mortality records of COVID-19 in the State of Pará, which has a subtropical climate with temperatures between 20 and 35 °C, after the implementation of social distancing by quarantine and adoption of lockdown. The follow-up was carried out by the daily data from the technical bulletins provided by the State of Pará Public Health Secretary (SESPA). On 18 March 2020, Pará notified the first case of COVID-19. After 7 weeks, the number of confirmed cases reached 4756 with 375 deaths. The results show it took 49 days for 81% of the 144 states municipalities, distributed over an area of approximately 1 248 000 km(2) to register COVID-19 cases. Temperature variations between 24.5 and 33.1 °C did not promote the decline in the new infections curve. The association between social isolation, quarantine and lockdown as an action to contain the infection was effective in reducing the region's new cases registration of COVID-19 in the short-term. However, short periods of lockdown may have promoted the virus spread among peripheral municipalities of the capital, as well as to inland regions.","Lélis da Silva, Félix; Dias Pita, Javier; Gomes, Maryjane Dias A.; Lélis da Silva, Andréa P.; da Silva, Gabriel Lélis P.",Epidemiol Infect,389,2

The first major professional football league to restart after the lockdown was the German Bundesliga. This study investigates whether the injury incidence increased after the restart of the season with only 9 days of regular preparation time and without any friendly matches in comparison to three control periods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, injury analysis (at least 1 day of absence from official football matches or training sessions) of the German Bundesliga registry was standardised according to Hägglund et al. (Br J Sports Med 39:340–346, 2005) and Fuller et al. (Clin J Sports Med 16:97–106, 2006) for data collection and to previous publications for the validated use of media sources for injury registration. The study period after the lockdown in May and June of the 2019–2020 season was compared to three control periods: the period directly before the lockdown, the beginning of the 2019–2020 season and the 2018–2019 season final. RESULTS: The nine match days after the restart of the 2019–2020 season showed an overall injury incidence of 4.9 per 1000 h football. This rate was significantly lower than that of the previous season final (9 last match days, overall injury incidence: 6.9 per 1000 h football; p < 0.001) and not increased compared to the rates after the summer break (9 match days; incidence: 5.5/1000 h, p > 0.05) or the winter break (8 match days; incidence: 5.6/1000 h, p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The period after the unexpected break in the 2019–2020 season due to the coronavirus lockdown and the rapid return to competition showed no increase in the injury rate compared to the pre-lockdown period and a lower injury rate than in the previous season final. The unintentional mid-season rest with its potential for physical recovery and individual fitness training seems to have had a positive effect on injury occurrence.","Krutsch, Werner; Hadji, Abed; Tröß, Tobias; Szymski, Dominik; aus der Fünten, Karen; Gärtner, Barbara; Alt, Volker; Meyer, Tim",Arch Orthop Trauma Surg,389,1

A positive result of antibody tests suggests that the individual has potentially been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, thus allowing to identify asymptomatic infections and determine the seroprevalence in a given population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of a newly developed high throughput immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody detection on the Luminex MAGPIX platform. Clinical agreement studies were performed in 42 COVID-19 patient serum samples and 162 negative donor serum/plasma samples. Positive percent agreement (PPA) was 42.86% (95% CI: 9.90% to 81.59%), 71.43% (95% CI: 29.04% to 96.33%), and 28.57% (95% CI: 13.22% to 48.67%) for samples collected on 0-7 days, 8-14 days, and 2-8 weeks from symptom onset, respectively. Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) was 97.53% (95% CI: 93.80% to 99.32%). There was no cross-reactivity with the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody. Hemoglobin (200 mg/dL), bilirubin (2 mg/dL), triglyceride (250 mg/dL) and EDTA (10 mM) showed no significant interfering effect on this assay. In conclusion, an anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody assay with high sensitivity and specificity has been developed. With the high throughput, this assay will speed up the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM testing.","Zhang, D.; Xu, T.; Chu, E.; Zhang, A.; Du, J.; Sha, M.",,389,1

The aim was to assess long-term dynamics and factors associated with the serological response against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 after primary infection. Methods. A prospective longitudinal study with monthly serological follow-up during the first 4 months, and then at 6, 8 and 10 months after the disease onset of all recovered adult in- and out-patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) attending Udine Hospital (Italy) during the first wave (from March to May 2020). Results. 542 individuals were included (289 female, mean age 53.1 years), mostly with mild COVID-19 (370, 68.3%). Patients were followed for a median of 302 days (Interquartile Range, 186-311). Overall seroconversion rate within two months was 32% for IgM and 90% for IgG. Seroreversion was observed in 90% of patients for IgM at 4 months and in 47% for IgG at 10 months. older age, number of symptoms at acute onset, severity of acute COVID-19, were all independent predictors of long-term immunity both for IgM (ß, linear regression coefficient, 1.10, p=0.001; ß 5.15 p=0.014; ß 43.84 p=0.021, respectively) and for IgG (ß 1.43 p<0.001; ß 10.46 p<0.001; ß 46.79 p<0.001, respectively), whereas the initial IgG peak was associated only with IgG duration (ß 1.12, p <0.001). Conclusions. IgM antibodies disappeared at four months and IgG antibodies declined in about half of patients 10 months after acute COVID-19. These effects varied depending on the intensity of the initial antibody response, age and burden of acute COVID-19. Summary A longitudinal study including an unselected population of recovered patients (n=542) after the first wave of COVID-19 demonstrated a fall of 90% for IgM antibodies at four months and a fall of 47% for IgG antibodies at 10 months. Antibody decline was slower in older, severely ill patients and associated with the initial number of symptoms and antibody titer.","Peghin, Maddalena; De Martino, Maria; Fabris, Martina; Palese, Alvisa; Visintini, Erica; Graziano, Elena; Gerussi, Valentina; Bontempo, Giulia; D'Aurizio, Federica; Biasotto, Alessia; Sartor, Assunta; Pipan, Corrado; Marzinotto, Stefania; Curcio, Francesco; Bouza, Emilio; Isola, Miriam; Tascini, Carlo",J Clin Microbiol,389,16

This brief communication assesses the impact of the COVID-19 response on the TB control activities of Addis Ababa health centers based on research project data. We compared the patient flows in pre-COVID-19 period (quarter 1, Q1) and during COVID-19 (quarter 2, Q2 and quarter 3, Q3) of 2020 at 56 health centers in Addis Ababa from all 10 sub-cities per sub-city. The patient flow declined from 3,473 in Q1 to 1,062 in Q2 and 1,074 in Q3, which is a decrease by 62-76% and 52-80% in Q2 and Q3 respectively as compared to that of Q1. In Q2, Kolfe keranio and Kirkos sub-cities recorded the biggest decline (76 and 75% respectively) whereas Yeka sub-city had the least decline (62%). In Q3, Kirkos sub-city had the biggest decline (80%) and Addis ketema sub-city had the lowest (52%). We conclude that the series of measures, state of emergency proclamation and government directives issued to counter the spread of COVID-19 and the public response to these significantly affected the TB control activities in Addis Ababa city as attested by the decrease in the patient flow at the clinics. Health authorities may inform the public that essential health services are still available and open to everyone in need of these services.","Beyene, Negussie Wodajo; Sitotaw, Alemu Lakew; Tegegn, Ben; Bobosha, Kidist",Pan Afr Med J,389,26

Like the Phillips Curve, this apparent output‐infection trade‐off is an elusive one and it is lost in the long run. Containing infections calls for decisive policy action. This paper shows that we could design a reaction function, which sets the level of economic activity as a function of the state of infection, in such a way that the possibility of an infection explosion would be eliminated.

Aim of this study was to analyse the outcomes depending on the COVID-19 status of the centre. Patients undergoing surgery in six COVID-19 treatment and one COVID-free hospitals (five countries) during the first COVID-19 peak were included. Variables associated with risk of moderate-to-severe complications were identified using logistic regression analysis. A total of 91 patients with Crohn’s disease (54, 59.3%) or ulcerative colitis (37, 40.7%), 66 (72.5%) had surgery in one of the COVID-19-treatment hospitals, while 25 (27.5%) in the COVID-19-free centre.

The implementation of screening patients for biopsychosocial distress has become a standard of practice in cancer care. With the presence of COVID-19, clinical care has shifted from in-person care to virtual care in many instances. One of the realities of COVID-19 is the significant decrease in screening patients for biopsychosocial symptom burden. METHODS: Given that screening for distress has become an accreditation standard in many cancer programs, in the province of Alberta, Canada, all patients are screened for distress with every visit to the cancer centre. Given the presence of COVID-19, much of cancer care has shifted to being delivered virtually (through mediums such as Zoom). In this paper, we present pre- and post-COVID data on the frequency of distress screening and its impact on patient care. RESULTS: A review of pre- and post-COVID-19 screening for distress questionnaires revealed that patients who received virtual care were less satisfied in the areas of emotional support and received less resources and referrals to supportive care. CONCLUSION: The rapid integration of virtual care without the inclusion of a standardized distress screening tool was akin to a natural experiment, as two groups (virtual and in-person clinic patients) received different levels of care and interventions. Without the inclusion of distress screening, the clinical conversation around symptoms is less likely to occur and results in fewer referrals to best practices in supportive care services. Lessons learned about virtual cancer care without distress screening in the time of COVID-19 demonstrates significantly fewer patients being screened for distress and subsequently has resulted in less supportive care referrals. Going forward, we must find ways to ensure that virtual cancer care continues to support distress screening and best patient-centric care.","Bultz, Barry D.; Watson, Linda",Support Care Cancer,389,20

Evidence to support speculation includes in vitro evidence for humoral and cellular cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 in specimens obtained before the pandemic started. METHOD: We used retrospective health insurance enrollment records, claims, and laboratory results to assemble a cohort of 869,236 insured individuals who had a PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. We estimated the effects of having clinical encounters for various diagnostic categories in the year preceding the study period on the risk of a positive test result. FINDINGS: After adjusting for age, gender and care seeking behavior, we identified that individuals with diagnoses for common cold symptoms, including acute sinusitis, bronchitis, or pharyngitis in the preceding year had a lower risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (OR=0.76, 95%CI=0.75, 0.77). No reduction in the odds of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 was seen in individuals under 18 years. The reduction in odds in adults remained stable for four years but was strongest in those with recent common cold symptoms. INTERPRETATION: While this study cannot attribute this association to cross-immunity resulting from a prior CCC infection, it is one potential explanation. Regardless of the cause, the reduction in the odds of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 among those with a recent diagnosis of common cold symptoms may have a role in shifting future COVD-19 infection patterns from endemic to episodic.","Aran, Dvir; Beachler, Daniel C.; Lanes, Stephan; Overhage, J.

Vice versa, pathogens counteract immune defense by inhibiting or redirecting the ubiquitination machinery of the host. A common immune evasion strategy is for viruses to target host immunoproteins for proteasomal or lysosomal degradation by employing viral or host ubiquitin ligases. By degrading key host adaptor and signaling molecules, viruses thus disable multiple immune response pathways including the production of and response to interferons as well as other innate host defense mechanisms. Recent work further revealed that viruses inhibit the ligation of ubiquitin or ULMs or remove ubiquitin from host cell proteins. Thus, viruses succeed in either stabilizing negative regulators of innate immune signaling or thwart host cell proteins that are activated by ubiquitin or ULM-modification.","Viswanathan, Kasinath; Früh, Klaus; DeFilippis, Victor",Current Opinion in Microbiology,389,24

Subjects predicting a longer lockdown period reported a higher average level of daily life satisfaction. Females reported on average lower levels of daily life satisfaction, but exhibited a stronger tendency to report higher levels of life satisfaction, the longer their lockdown forecast. Individual heterogeneity in life satisfaction levels can be partly attributed to personality traits, with neuroticism having a negative effect, while extraversion and agreeableness having a positive effect on daily life satisfaction.","Sabater-Grande, Gerardo; García-Gallego, Aurora; Georgantzís, Nikolaos; Herranz-Zarzoso, Noemí",Front Psychol,389,5

Overall, our meta-analysis showed that there was a huge reduction of nearly 80% for STEMI admission during the outbreak (n = 10,263) in contrast to before the outbreak period (n = 51,984). STEMI patients who were admitted during the outbreak received less primary PCI and had longer symptom-to-FMC (first medical contact) time along with prolonged door-to-balloon (DTB) time. A decrease in the achievement of final TIMI (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction) 3 flow after primary PCI was also observed in this study. However, the number of in-hospital mortality was similar between two groups. CONCLUSION: There was a decrease in the STEMI care performance and worsening of clinical outcomes in STEMI patients, especially in the early pandemic period. Overall, concise health services must be implemented following a responsibility to obey health protocols to deliver high-quality services related to STEMI systems of care amidst the global pandemic.","Kamarullah, William; Sabrina, Adelia Putri; Rocky, Marthin Alexander; Gozali, Darius Revin",Indian Heart J,389,6

The use of such equipment may affect their non-technical skills, augment fatigue, and affect performance. This study aimed to assess the surgeons’ perceptions of the impact of wearing PPE during emergency surgery throughout the pandemic. METHODS: An international cooperation group conducted an anonymous online survey among surgeons from over 30 countries, to assess perceptions about the impact of PPE use on non-technical skills, overall comfort, decision making, and surgical performance during emergency surgery on COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Responses to the survey (134) were received from surgeons based on 26 countries. The vast majority (72%) were males. More than half of the respondents (54%) felt that their surgical performance was hampered with PPE. Visual impairment was reported by 63%, whereas 54% had communication impediments. Less than half (48%) felt protected with the use of PPE, and the same proportion perceived that the use of such equipment influenced their decision making. Decreased overall comfort was cited by 66%, and 82% experienced increased surgical fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons perceived impediment for both visibility and communication, and other non-technical skills while using PPE on emergency surgery in COVID-19 patients. Their perceived lack of protection and comfort and increased fatigue may have inhibited their optimal surgical performance. More attention should be placed in the design of more user-friendly equipment, given the possibility of a second wave of the pandemic.","Yánez Benítez, Carlos; Güemes, Antonio; Aranda, José; Ribeiro, Marcelo; Ottolino, Pablo; Di Saverio, Salomone; Alexandrino, Henrique; Ponchietti, Luca; Blas, Juan L.; Ramos, Juan Pablo; Rangelova, Elena; Muñoz, Mercedes; Yánez, Carlos",World J Surg,389,1

DESIGN: A systematic review adopting a framework synthesis approach was conducted. An electronic search of the literature was undertaken in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Social Work Abstract and CINAHL via EBSCO, Global Health, Cochrane library, the Trip database and ProQuest between 1995 and 2020. Search terms included bereavement care, ethnic minority populations and the UK setting. RESULTS: From 3,185 initial records, following screening for eligibility, and full-text review of 164 articles, seven studies were identified. There was no research literature outlining the role of family, friends and existing networks; and a real absence of evidence about outcomes and levels of satisfaction for those from an ethnic minority background who receive bereavement care. From the limited literature, the overarching theme for barriers to bereavement care was ‘unfamiliarity and irregularities’. Four identified subthemes were ‘lack of awareness’; ‘variability in support’; ‘type and format of support’; and ‘culturally specific beliefs’. The overarching theme for facilitators for bereavement care was ‘accessibility’ with the two subthemes being ‘readily available information’ and ‘inclusive approaches’. Three studies reported on examples of different models of care provision. CONCLUSIONS: This review reveals a stark lack of evidence about bereavement care for ethnic minority populations. In particular, understanding more about the role of family, friends and existing support systems, alongside outcomes and satisfaction will begin to develop the evidence base underpinning current provision. Direct user-representation through proactive engagement and co-design approaches may begin to determine the most appropriate models and format of bereavement care for ethnic minority communities to inform service design and delivery.","Mayland, Catriona R.; Powell, Richard A.; Clarke, Gemma C.; Ebenso, Bassey; Allsop, Matthew J.",PLoS One,389,4

OBJECTIVES: Map pre- and post-exposure prophylactic (PrEP and PEP) candidate for COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: PubMed/Medline, Embase, International Committee of Medical Journal Editors and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform clinical trial registries and MedRxiv. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND PARTICIPANTS: All studies in humans or animals and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in humans reporting primary data on prophylactic candidates against COVID-19, excluding studies focused on key populations. INTERVENTIONS: PrEP and PEP candidate for COVID-19. METHODS: Systematic review (SR) and qualitative synthesis of COVID-19 PrEP and PEP studies and RCTs complemented by search of MedRxiv and PubMed and Embase for studies reporting RCTs outcomes since SR search completion. RESULTS: We identified 13 studies (out of 2,119 database records) and 117 RCTs (out of 5565 RCTs in the registries) meeting inclusion criteria. Non-RCT studies reported on cross-sectional studies using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in humans (n=2) or reported on animal studies (n=7) most of which used antibodies. All five completed RCTs focused on the use of HCQ as either PrEP or PEP and these and the cross-sectional studies reported no prophylactic effect. The majority of ongoing RCTs evaluated HCQ or other existing candidates including non-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, anti(retro)virals, or use of vitamins and supplements. CONCLUSIONS: The key message from completed studies and RCTs seems to be that HCQ does not work, there is little evidence regarding other compounds with all RCTs using candidates other than HCQ still ongoing. It remains to be seen if the portfolio of existing molecules being evaluated in RCTs will identify successful prophylaxis against COVID-19 or if there is a need for the development of new candidates.","Smit, Mikaela; Marinosci, Annalisa; Agoritsas, Thomas; Ford, Nathan; Calmy, Alexandra",Clin Microbiol Infect,389,33

It is the most infectious variant of SARS-CoV-2 to date, and its high infectivity means that a higher proportion of the population needs to be vaccinated to reduce the disease burden, which poses a substantial public health challenge. AREAS COVERED: The evolution of the Delta variant is reviewed, including an overview of the Delta Plus variant with a K417N mutation in the RBD, which may confer an improved immune evasion ability. Decreases in serum neutralizing antibody titers after vaccination against Delta were greater than those against Alpha but less than those against Beta. The protective efficacy of existing vaccines against the Delta variant have declined and is related to the number of doses and the time since vaccination. EXPERT OPINION: The currently used vaccines are effective against hospitalization/severe disease due to the Delta variant. Accelerating the popularization of vaccination, improving the coverage rate, and the implementation of intervention measures, such as wearing masks, are effective means to control the spread of the Delta variant and other variants. However, vaccination alone against SARS-CoV-2 without intervention measures may lead to continuous spread and the emergence of new variants.","Bian, Lianlian; Gao, Qiushuang; Gao, Fan; Wang, Qian; He, Qian; Wu, Xing; Mao, Qunying; Xu, Miao; Liang, Zhenglun",Expert Rev Vaccines,389,1

The COVID-19 pandemic represents a situation with a high amount of stress exposure, which in turn may be associated with negative emotional outcome like depressive symptoms. The current study investigated if resilience moderated the effect of stress on symptoms of depression and if anxiety symptoms mediated this association. An adult sample of community controls completed the Perceived stress scale 14 (PSS-14), the Resilience scale for adults (RSA), the Patient health questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7). Independent samples t-test, correlation analyses and moderated mediation analyses were conducted. The results showed that resilience moderated the relations between stress and anxiety symptoms (β = −0.131, p < 0.001) as well as between stress and depressive symptoms (β = −0.068, p < 0.05). In support of a moderated mediation model, resilience moderated the indirect effect of stress on depressive symptom, as confirmed by the index of moderated mediation (IMM = −0.036, p < 0.001; [95% BCa: −0.055, −0.020]). The high resilience subgroup was less affected than the low resilience subgroup by the effect of stress exposure symptoms of depression, mediated by anxiety. The study shows that stress exposure is associated with symptoms of depression, and anxiety mediates this association. Level of resilience differentiates the direct and indirect effect of stress on depression. Knowledge about the effect of stress in response to a pandemic is important for developing treatment and prevention strategies for stress, depression and health-related anxiety.","Havnen, Audun; Anyan, Frederick; Hjemdal, Odin; Solem, Stian; Gurigard Riksfjord, Maja; Hagen, Kristen",Int J Environ Res Public Health,389,26

METHODS: This was an observational prospective study that comprised consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to hospital from 21 February to 6 April 2020. The patients’ medical history, demographic, epidemiologic and clinical data were collected in an electronic patient chart. The dataset was used to train predictive models using an established machine learning framework leveraging a hybrid approach where clinical expertise is applied alongside a data-driven analysis. The study outcome was the onset of moderate to severe respiratory failure defined as PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio <150 mmHg in at least one of two consecutive arterial blood gas analyses in the following 48 hours. Shapley Additive exPlanations values were used to quantify the positive or negative impact of each variable included in each model on the predicted outcome. RESULTS: A total of 198 patients contributed to generate 1068 usable observations which allowed to build 3 predictive models based respectively on 31-variables signs and symptoms, 39-variables laboratory biomarkers and 91-variables as a composition of the two. A fourth “boosted mixed model” included 20 variables was selected from the model 3, achieved the best predictive performance (AUC = 0.84) without worsening the FN rate.

The aim of this study is to identify HCV infection in a disadvantaged population before the onset of symptoms and guide to specialized services for initiation of antiviral therapy, thus adhering to the WHO goal of elimination the infection. Materials and Methods: In the first two weeks after the start of the study, 320 patients with detectable risk factors for HCV were tested using rapid tests, in a southwestern city of Romania, Orşova, with the participation of four doctors, via Family Medicine Offices. Results: As a percentage, the amount of detection based on rapid tests was 2.5%, the positive results have apparently been achieved exclusively among female subjects. All patients have been informed about the result and included in the diagnostic trial, where they were fully evaluated to determine if they were eligible for therapy. Conclusions. Population screening contributes to the diagnosis and elimination of an underdiagnosed pathology, in a disadvantaged area with limited access to medical care. The positive feedback that has been received in just a few weeks after its beginning, once again has motivated to emphasis the population screening, with real considerations on the possibility of expanding this program on a large scale.","BUTARU, ANCA ELENA; DOICA, IRINA PAULA; GHEONEA, DAN IONUŢ; ROGOVEANU, ION; DICULESCU, MIRCEA; OANCEA, CARMEN NICOLETA",Curr Health Sci J,389,9

OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in trauma admissions throughout Los Angeles County (LAC) during the pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, all trauma admissions to the 15 verified level 1 and level 2 trauma centers in LAC from January 1 to June 7, 2020 were reviewed. All trauma admissions from the same period in 2019 were used as historical control. For overall admissions, the study period was divided into 3 intervals based on daily admission trend analysis (January 1 through February 28, March 1 through April 9, April 10 through June 7). For the blunt trauma subgroup analysis, the study period was divided into 3 similar intervals (January 1 through February 27, February 28 through April 5, April 6 through June 7). EXPOSURES: COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Trends in trauma admission volume and injury patterns. RESULTS: A total of 6777 patients in 2020 and 6937 in 2019 met inclusion criteria. Of those admitted in 2020, the median (interquartile range) age was 42 (28-61) years and 5100 (75.3%) were men. Mechanisms of injury were significantly different between the 2 years, with a higher incidence of penetrating trauma and fewer blunt injuries in 2020 compared with 2019 (penetrating: 1065 [15.7%] vs 1065 [15.4%]; blunt: 5309 [78.3%] vs 5528 [79.7%]). Overall admissions by interval in 2020 were 2681, 1684, and 2412, whereas in 2019 they were 2462, 1862, and 2613, respectively. There was a significant increase in overall admissions per week during the first interval (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.02; 95% CI, 1.002-1.04; P = .03) followed by a decrease in the second interval (IRR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.90-0.94; P < .001) and, finally, an increase in the third interval (IRR, 1.05; CI, 1.03-1.07; P < .001). On subgroup analysis, blunt admissions followed a similar pattern to overall admissions, while penetrating admissions increased throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, trauma centers throughout LAC experienced a significant change in injury patterns and admission trends during the COVID-19 pandemic. A transient decrease in volume was followed by a quick return to baseline levels. Trauma centers should prioritize maintaining access, capacity, and functionality during pandemics and other national emergencies.","Ghafil, Cameron; Matsushima, Kazuhide; Ding, Li; Henry, Reynold; Inaba, Kenji",JAMA Netw Open,389,14
