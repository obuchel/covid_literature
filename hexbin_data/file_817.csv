Sixty-eight patients with inflammatory CNS diseases and 30 healthy volunteers were included in this prospective observational cohort study. The observational period was between January 2005 and May 2009. The CO(2) R was measured by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound using the breath-holding method. We compared patients with normal CO(2) R (breath-holding index [BHI(m)] ≥ 1.18 = BHI(N) group) with patients who showed impaired CO(2) R (BHI(m) < 1.18 = BHI(R) group). We also analyzed the association of impaired CO(2) R with the etiology, severity, and outcome of disease. When compared to the BHI(N) group, the patients from the BHI(R) group were older, had a heavier consciousness disturbance, experienced more frequent respiratory failure, and, subsequently, had worse outcomes. There were no fatalities among the 28 patients in the BHI(N) group. The comparison of subjects with bacterial and non-bacterial meningitis revealed no significant differences. The unfavorable outcome of disease (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] score 1–3) was significantly more common in subjects with impaired CO(2) R (62.5% vs. 10.7%). Logistic regression analysis was performed in order to establish the prognostic value of BHI(m). The outcome variable was unfavorable outcome (GOS 1–3), while the independent variables were age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, and BHI(m). The age and BHI(m) showed the strongest influence on disease outcome. A decrease of BHI(m) for each 0.1 unit increased the risk of unfavorable outcome by 17%. Our study emphasizes the importance of CO(2) R assessment in patients with inflammatory CNS diseases.","Lepur, D.; Kutleša, M.; Baršić, B.",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,817,8

However, recent research has shown that DNNs can be brittle to even slight variations of the input data. Therefore, rigorous testing of DNNs has gained widespread attention. While DNN robustness under norm-bound perturbation got significant attention over the past few years, our knowledge is still limited when natural variants of the input images come. These natural variants, e.g., a rotated or a rainy version of the original input, are especially concerning as they can occur naturally in the field without any active adversary and may lead to undesirable consequences. Thus, it is important to identify the inputs whose small variations may lead to erroneous DNN behaviors. The very few studies that looked at DNN’s robustness under natural variants, however, focus on estimating the overall robustness of DNNs across all the test data rather than localizing such error-producing points. This work aims to bridge this gap. To this end, we study the local per-input robustness properties of the DNNs and leverage those properties to build a white-box (DeepRobust-W) and a black-box (DeepRobust-B) tool to automatically identify the non-robust points. Our evaluation of these methods on three DNN models spanning three widely used image classification datasets shows that they are effective in flagging points of poor robustness. In particular, DeepRobust-W and DeepRobust-B are able to achieve an F1 score of up to 91.4% and 99.1%, respectively. We further show that DeepRobust-W can be applied to a regression problem in a domain beyond image classification. Our evaluation on three self-driving car models demonstrates that DeepRobust-W is effective in identifying points of poor robustness with F1 score up to 78.9%.","Zhong, Ziyuan; Tian, Yuchi; Ray, Baishakhi",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,817,16

Full return to normal is not on the horizon; full distance education is possible but not optimal for most educational programs; and somewhere in between is quite a challenge. However, it is striking that the continuum focuses entirely on official educational activities and that there is no attention for informal educational activities: a neglect that is reflected in the current discussions about the future of our education.

In the UK, the birthplace of parliamentary democracy, the parliament rejected the Withdrawal Agreement negotiated between the EU and Prime Minister May on three occasions. After the May government resigned, the government of Boris Johnson in the wake of a general election victory (December 2019) was able to secure a prompt exit from the EU at the end of January 2020. However, the new economic relationship between the EU and the UK is yet to be reconstructed. Negotiations remain on-going at a time when Covid-19 continues to cause a large loss of life and major economic disruption. It is a phenomenon not to be overlooked, that Asian Countries controlled Covid-19 very well, including Australia and New Zealand, but especially Hong Kong, Taiwan and Vietnam. How will the post-Covid-19 world change? The trend of international ‘power politics’ in the early twenty-first century appears to be strengthening, Chinese influence is widening through the 16 + 1 and 17 + 1 policy and is making itself felt across half of the European Union.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic that began in China in 2019 swept around the world imposing unprecedented impacts on all the sectors of the world economy. The multibillion-dollar sports tourism industry was hit hard. This chapter unravels the impacts of COVID-19 on sporting events and, by default, sporting tourism. Such information is key for the industry to develop resilience against future pandemics and other natural disasters. Document and critical discourse analysis was used in gathering and analysing data. The findings show that most sporting events were either cancelled or postponed during the peak of the pandemic because of COVID-19 containment measures across the world, such as travel bans and port closures. Many sports governing bodies were also bankrupted and left in financial distress. Individual athletes lost income as their salaries were reduced or completely cut. Sponsors, betting firms, broadcasters and others in the sports value chain also incurred huge losses during this period. Among the key events affected were the 2020 Olympics, football leagues, golf, cricket, marathons, rugby and tennis. As such, there was a need for bailout packages and seeking alternatives for the sports industry to recover from the shock. This chapter recommends post-COVID-19 reviews of the sports industry and putting in place alternative future intervention measures for similar pandemics and other disasters.","Nhamo, Godwell; Dube, Kaitano; Chikodzi, David",Counting the Cost of COVID-19 on the Global Tourism Industry,817,1

Because ICDs have enabled more patients to live longer, they often succumb to noncardiac diseases and may be cared for by primary care physicians. Despite published recommendations 10 years ago regarding the management of ICDs during the end of life, over half of patients with ICDs who are dying still have not been offered the choice of deactivation. The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has complicated this issue and the need to discuss it because of practices that separate patients from loved ones and that modify the usual interactions of patients with doctors and nurses. We offer the following recommendations: (1) the management of ICDs at the end-of-life needs to be understood by all physicians who care for patients with ICDs; (2) discussions about deactivating the ICD should occur while patients have decision-making capacity and are clinically stable, beginning at the time of ICD implantation, then periodically at follow-up appointments, and certainly when a change in the patient's clinical status warrants a reconsideration of the goals of care; and (3) clinicians should compensate for the impediments to communication with patients and families associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which includes patient isolation and restrictive visitor policies, by using devices that permit visual communication to reexamine goals of care, including defibrillator deactivation, in patients with ICDs who are expected to die.","Myers, Sarah E; Eastwood, Gregory L",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,817,19

Targeted therapies, which enhance accumulation of the drug in the tumor, may be realized using tumor-specific binding peptides. This paper identifies and characterizes an HNSCC affine peptide. METHODS From a phage library comprising 10(9) different displayed peptides, 1 peptide was enriched after 5 in vitro selection rounds on HNO223 tumor cells. Subsequently, the gained peptide sequence H(2)N-SPRGDLAVLGHKY-CONH(2) (HBP-1) was synthesized as an amide and labeled with (125)I. In vitro studies for binding kinetics and competition were performed with 5 different HNSCC cell lines. Furthermore, the stability of the peptide was evaluated in human serum. The in vivo biodistribution of (131)I-labeled peptide was determined in HNSCC tumor-bearing nude mice. The results were further validated in human HNSCC tumor tissue sections using fluorescence-labeled HBP-1. Competition experiments were performed to determine the binding sequence and validate the target. RESULTS The HBP-1 motif was enriched in 62% of all phages sequenced. Labeled (125)I-HBP-1 showed binding to 5 different HNSCC cell lines and a maximum binding to HNO97 cells, with 11% of the applied dose per 10(6) cells and an inhibitory concentration of 50% of 38.9 nM. Stability experiments in human serum showed a half-life of 55 min. In 2 different HNSCC tumor xenografts, (131)I-HBP-1 accumulated rapidly, with stable uptake until 45 min after intravenous application. Peptide immunohistochemistry of HNSCC tissue sections exhibited tumor staining by HBP-1, whereas normal tissue remained negative. Sequence mutation and competition experiments revealed that the intrinsic RGD motif in combination with the intrinsic LXXL motif is responsible for the binding ability of HBP1. The RGDLXXL sequence within this peptide is known and indicates that binding occurs via the alpha(v)beta(6) rather than the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin. CONCLUSION Within the sequence of HBP-1 is a RGDLXXL motif, and most likely it is targeting the alpha(v)beta(6) receptor of the integrin family of cell adhesion receptors. HBP-1 represents a promising lead structure for the development of targeted therapies or diagnostic procedures in patients with HNSCC.","Nothelfer, Eva-Maria; Zitzmann-Kolbe, Sabine; Garcia-Boy, Regine; Krämer, Susanne; Herold-Mende, Christel; Altmann, Annette; Eisenhut, Michael; Mier, Walter; Haberkorn, Uwe","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",817,23

The non-availability of proven treatment technologies for TCS remediation is the central issue stressing thorough research on understanding the underlying mechanisms of toxicity and assessing vital biomarkers in the aquatic organism for practical monitoring purposes. Given the unprecedented circumstances during COVID 19 pandemic, a several-fold higher discharge of TCS in the aquatic ecosystems cannot be considered a remote possibility. Therefore, identifying potential biomarkers for assessing chronic effects of TCS are prerequisites for addressing the issues related to its ecological impact and its monitoring in the future. It is the first holistic review on highlighting the biomarkers of TCS toxicity based on a comprehensive review of available literature about the biomarkers related to cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, hematological, alterations of gene expression, and metabolic profiling. This review establishes that biomarkers at the subcellular level such as oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, neurotoxicity, and metabolic enzymes can be used to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of TCS in future investigations. Micronuclei frequency and % DNA damage proved to be reliable biomarkers for genotoxic effects of TCS in fishes and other aquatic organisms. Alteration of gene expression and metabolic profiling in different organs provides a better insight into mechanisms underlying the biocide's toxicity. In the concluding part of the review, the present status of knowledge about mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance of TCS and its relevance in understanding the toxicity is also discussed referring to the relevant reports on microorganisms.","Kumar, Saurav; Paul, Tapas; Shukla, S P; Kumar, Kundan; Karmakar, Sutanu; Bera, Kuntal Krishna; Bhushan Kumar, Chandra",Environmental pollution,817,1

Methods : Healthcare workers taking hydroxycholoroquin as pre exposure prophylaxis, patients taking hydroxychloroquin were monitored by holter electrocardiographic telemetry with continuous beat to beat analysis for seven days with capacity to report any arrhythmic event or significant QT prolongation instantly to medical faculty. Results : 25 participants with mean age 42.4 {+/-} 14.1 years, 40% females. 20% patients needed to stop HCQ. Four patients developed QT prolongation > 500 ms and needed to stop HCQ, one patient had accelerated idioventricular rhythm and stopped treatment. one had short episodes of atrial fibrillation.

Methods: We recruited COVID-19 cases to give blood, saliva, mid-turbinate and fomite (phone) swabs, and 30-minute breath samples while vocalizing into a Gesundheit-II, with and without masks at up to two visits two days apart. We quantified and sequenced viral RNA, cultured virus, and assayed sera for anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain antibodies. Results: We enrolled 61 participants with active infection, May 2020 through April 2021.

In addition, we sought to determine the moderating effect of bank ownership (i.e., state-owned and private sector banks) on the above relationships. Data were collected at random through online surveys that were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Empirical findings revealed that service justice and quality have a significant effect on service satisfaction and customer loyalty. Social influence has a significant effect on customer loyalty, but not on service satisfaction;however, corporate image is positively related to service satisfaction, but not to customer loyalty. Understandably, service satisfaction was assumed to have a fundamental relationship to consumer loyalty. However, moderation results indicated that state or private sector ownership of banks was an equally important moderating factor for almost all dimensions relevant to customer loyalty, other than service justice, social influence, and service satisfaction.

For this reason, it is important to control these STIs, one of which is ''to detect''. The general methods in order to detect STIs are nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). One of the reasons why NAATs are utilized in many tests is that it is possibly to be more sensitive than other test. However, there needs to treat extraction of nucleic acids in advance and amplify specific regions by NAATs, and hence it must take much labour and much time. In this work, for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Treponema pallidum (TP) which is each etiological agent of chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis, we evaluate and propose ''quicker and simpler'' NAATs. Specifically, utilizing mobile real-time PCR device ''PCR1100'' and PCR reagent kit ''KAPA3G Plant PCR Kit'', it was considered whether real-time direct PCR could be performed or not without treating DNA extraction in advance so-called ''direct''. As a result, firstly, we established that real-time direct PCR could be performed in all of CT, NG, and TP, and moreover, each Ct value correlated with the concentration of each organism similarly to detection of genome DNA (each correlation coefficient R2 > 0.95). Moreover, each assay demonstrated a limit of detection (LOD) of the follows; CT was 10^0.86 = 7.24 IFU/reaction, NG was 10^-0.19 = 0.65 CFU/reaction, and TP was 10^1.4 = 25.1 organisms/reaction. However, it appeared the sensitivity was a little low, especially for CT and TP. Secondly, we found that even as without treating sample in advance, the time of detection was required more less 15 minutes at any of case, which was very quick compared with other current methods for real-time PCR. Additionally, compared with other commercial devices, it was easier to operate the PCR1100 device, for example, start, analysis of Ct value. In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that it is possible for real-time direct PCR to perform with combination of the PCR1100 device and the PCR reagent kit in 3 kinds of microorganisms-CT, NG and TP. Furthermore, we propose ''quicker and simpler'' methods for NAATs, which it would not take labour and time. Further studies are needed in order to contribute to control STIs.","Muraoka, M.; Sohma, K.; Kawaguchi, O.; Mizukoshi, M.",,817,27

The researchers examine the dependency of the tourism industry on the general preparation programs that were developed and are currently being deployed by the relevant national stakeholders and question whether instead, it should use the pandemic as a catalyst for formulating its own nuanced tourism-travel-and-hospitality-oriented strategies and procedures.Design/methodology/approachApplying an ethnographic-based mix-methods research approach, this paper draws on insights from data compiled by fusing existing theoretical and emerging practical knowledge with empirical research (qualitative and quantitative) conducted among numerous relevant macro (governmental/centralized industry) and micro (hotels, travel and tourism operators and service providers) stakeholders as well as potential consumers.FindingsIt is essential that national and local government bodies form collaborative interorganizational relationships with local stakeholders to jointly activate case-specific hospitality and travel-specific risk mitigation management strategies. Moreover, the pandemic laid bare the tentative and fragile nature of the globalized tourism industry supply and demand chains, a condition that may be remedied via a pivot toward using national or even regional supply chains and goods and service providers. Within Israel, such changes could lead to increased economic benefits that extend beyond the tourism industry to provide certain security-related benefits.Originality/valueRelating to idiosyncratic factors relevant to an Israeli cultural context, this paper uses the ethnographic field-borne familiarity of the researchers with the tourism and travel industries in Eilat and the Dead Sea to offer applicable suggestions for leveraging certain industry resources to both meet the demands of the present-day circumstances and cultivate a multifaceted organizational web of macro and micro social, economic and environmental networks so as to foster a more diversified and therefore resilient local tourism and travel economy.","Schmidt, Joshua Altshuler Alex",Worldwide Hospitality and Tourism Themes,817,28

Superspreading events have recently been reported in the transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study uses a set of nine ordinary differential equations to investigate the impact of superspreading on COVID-19 dynamics. The model developed in this study addresses the heterogeineity in infectiousness by taking into account two forms of transmission rate functions for superspreaders based on clinical (infectivity level) and social or environmental (contact level). The basic reproduction number has been derived and the contribution of each infectious compartment towards the generation of new COVID-19 cases is ascertained.

However the immunogenicity of the vector itself decreases its effectiveness as a boosting vaccine due to the induction of strong anti-vector neutralising immunity. Here we determined how dissolvable microneedle patches (DMN) for skin immunization can overcome this issue, using a clinically-relevant adenovirus-based Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine, AdHu5-PfRH5, in mice. Incorporation of vaccine into patches significantly enhanced its thermostability compared to the liquid form. Conventional high dose repeated immunization by the intramuscular (IM) route induced low antigen-specific IgG titres and high anti-vector immunity. A low priming dose of vaccine, by the IM route but more so using DMN patches, induced the most efficacious immune responses, assessed by parasite growth inhibitory activity (GIA) assays. Administration of low dose AdHu5-PfRH5 using patches to the skin, boosted by high dose IM, induced the highest antigen-specific serum IgG response after boosting, the greatest skewing of the antibody response towards the antigen and away from the vector and the highest efficacy. This study therefore demonstrates that repeated use of the same adenovirus vaccine can be highly immunogenic towards the transgene if a low dose is used to prime the response. It also provides a method of stabilising adenovirus vaccine, in easy-to-administer dissolvable microneedle patches, permitting storage and distribution out of cold chain.","Flynn, Olivia; Dillane, Kate; Lanza, Juliane Sousa; Marshall, Jennifer M.; Jin, Jing; Silk, Sarah E.; Draper, Simon J.; Moore, Anne C.",bioRxiv,817,1

Recently, evidence from systematic reviews and database analyses have improved our understanding of key determinants of measles vaccine impact. We explore how updated representations of these determinants affect model-based estimation of MCV impact in ten countries with highest measles burden. Methods Using Dynamic Measles Immunisation Calculation Engine (DynaMICE), an age-structured compartmental model of measles transmission and vaccination, we evaluated the effect of evidence updates for five determinants of MCV impact: case fatality risk, contact patterns, age-dependent vaccine efficacy, the potential of supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs) to reach zero-dose children, and the basic reproduction number. We also evaluated the incremental impact of the first dose (MCV1), second dose (MCV2), and SIA dose of measles vaccines, based on country-specific coverage estimates from the World Health Organization. The MCV impact was assessed by cumulative vaccine-averted cases, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years over 2000-2050. Results Incorporated with the updated data sources, DynaMICE projected 252 million measles cases, 3.7 million deaths and 230 million disability-adjusted life years incurred over 2000-2050 in the ten high-burden countries when MCV1, MCV2, and SIA doses were implemented. Compared to no vaccination, the administration of MCV1 contributed to 66% reduction in cumulative measles burden, while MCV2 and SIAs reduced this further to 89%. With routine and supplementary vaccination, India and countries with high vaccination coverage could maintain measles incidence below 1 per million. Among the updated determinants, shifting from fixed to linearly-varying vaccine efficacy by age and from static to time-varying case fatality risks had the biggest effect on the model projections of MCV impact. While varying the basic reproduction number showed a limited effect on vaccine-averted burden, updates on the other four determinants together led to an overall reduction of MCV impact by 0.87-26.7%. Conclusions High coverage of measles vaccine through both routine and SIA delivery platforms are essential for achieving and maintaining low incidence in high-measles burden settings. Incorporating updated evidence particularly on vaccine efficacy and case fatality risk reduces estimates of the impact of vaccination slightly, but its overall impact remains considerable.","Fu, H.; Abbas, K.; Klepac, P.; van Zandvoort, K.; Tanvir, H.; Portnoy, A.; Jit, M.",,817,24

Repurposing and redesign of existing drugs against different targets is one potential way in which to accelerate this process. Suramin was initially developed as a successful anti-parasitic drug but has also shown promising antiviral and antibacterial activities. However, due to its high conformational flexibility and negative charge, suramin is considered quite promiscuous towards positively charged sites within nucleic acid binding proteins. Although some suramin analogs have been developed against specific targets, only limited structure activity relationship (SAR) studies were performed, and virtual screening has yet to be used to identify more specific inhibitor(s) based on its scaffold. Using available structures, we investigated suramin’s target diversity, confirming that suramin preferentially binds to protein pockets which are both positively charged and enriched in aromatic or leucine residues. Further, suramin’s high conformational flexibility allows adaptation to structurally diverse binding surfaces. From this platform, we developed a framework for structure- and docking-guided elaboration of suramin analog scaffolds using virtual screening of suramin and heparin analogs against a panel of diverse therapeutically relevant viral and bacterial protein targets. Use of this new framework to design potentially specific suramin analogs is exemplified using the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and nucleocapsid protein, identifying leads that might inhibit a wide range of coronaviruses.

Companies need to make further efforts and investments to improve their supply chain resilience (SCR) in becoming more prepared to minimise disruption risks. Sourcing is one of the main, strategic, key factors towards SC resilience. Also, organisations require resiliency in demand fulfilment to handle volatile marketplaces. This paper presents a methodology towards SCR to both supply and demand variations motivated by a real case study of a manufacturing company that works to improve its SC resilience. To this end, a hybrid integrated multi-attribute decision making-possibilistic bi-objective programming model (MADM-PBOPM) was developed. First, a new framework presenting pillars to assess suppliers’ resilience was developed based on a thorough literature review and decision makers’ input. Then, a DEMATEL-TOPSIS approach was proposed to quantify existing suppliers’ resilience and assess its performance. It also helped in categorising resilience pillars (RPs) as causes and effects. Thereafter, the obtained weights of suppliers and pillars were integrated into the developed PBOPM. The latter helps the purchasing team to (1) order materials from suppliers based on their resilience and performance efficiency;and (2) elevate the company’s resiliency to uncertain demands fulfilment. Therefore, the developed methodology can potentially be used by the purchasing teams to build up SCs that are resilient to supply disruption and demand uncertainty. This MADM-PBOPM model was validated as part of the case study investigation. Furthermore, the suppliers’ assessment output was validated by using two sensitivity analysis approaches including criteria weight variation and other MADM approaches.","Mohammed, A.; Naghshineh, B.; Spiegler, V.; Carvalho, H.",Computers &amp; Industrial Engineering,817,13

Here we show how the real-time nature of Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencers can accelerate consensus generation, lineage and variant status assignment. We exploit the fact that multiplexed viral sequencing libraries quickly generate sufficient data for the majority of samples, with diminishing returns on remaining samples as the sequencing run progresses. We demonstrate methods to determine when a sequencing run has passed this point in order to reduce the time required and cost of sequencing. Results We extended MinoTour, our real-time analysis and monitoring platform for nanopore sequencers, to provide SARS-CoV2 analysis using ARTIC network pipelines. We additionally developed an algorithm to predict which samples will achieve sufficient coverage, automatically running the ARTIC medaka informatics pipeline once specific coverage thresholds have been reached on these samples. After testing on run data, we find significant run time savings are possible, enabling flow cells to be used more efficiently and enabling higher throughput data analysis. The resultant consensus genomes are assigned both PANGO lineage and variant status as defined by Public Health England. Samples from within individual runs are used to generate phylogenetic trees incorporating optional background samples as well as summaries of individual SNPs.

Following FDA emergency use approval, widespread distribution of vaccines has resulted in rapid reduction in COVID-19 cases in vulnerable, older populations. Yet, vaccination coverage remains incomplete amongst residents and healthcare workers. As such, mitigation and prevention strategies are needed to reduce the ongoing risk of transmission and mortality amongst vulnerable, nursing home populations. One such strategy is that of 'shield immunity', in which recovered individuals increase their contact rates and therefore shield individuals who remain susceptible to infection. Here, we adapt recent population-scale shield immunity models to a network context. To do so, we evaluate network-based shield immunity by evaluating how restructured interactions in a bipartite network (e.g., between healthcare workers and long-term care residents) affects SARS-CoV-2 epidemic dynamics. First, we identify a series of rewiring principles that leverage viral testing, antibody testing, and vaccination information to reassign immunized healthcare workers to care for infected residents while retaining workload balance amidst an outbreak. We find a significant reduction in outbreak size when using infection and immune-based cohorting as a weekly intervention. Second, we also identify a preventative strategy using shield-immunity rewiring principles, by assigning susceptible healthcare workers to care for cohorts of immunized residents; this strategy reduces the risk that an inadvertent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the facility via a healthcare worker spreads to susceptible residents. Network-based epidemic modeling reveals that preventative rewiring can control the size of outbreaks at levels similar to that of isolation of infectious healthcare workers. Overall, this assessment of shield immunity provides further support for leveraging infection and immune status in network-based interventions to control and prevent the spread of COVID-19.","Lucia-Sanz, A.; Magalie, A.; Rodriguez-Gonzalez, R.; Leung, C.-Y.; Weitz, J.

Then, TACTICS uses a random forest model to identify potentially bindable residues in each selected conformation, based on protein motion and geometry. Lastly, residues in possible binding pockets are scored using fragment docking. As proof-of-principle, TACTICS was applied to the analysis of simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and methyltransferase and the Yersinia pestis aryl carrier protein. Our approach recapitulates known small-molecule binding sites and predicts the locations of sites not previously observed in experimentally determined structures. The TACTICS code is available at https://github.com/Albert-Lau-Lab/tactics_protein_analysis.","Evans, Daniel J.; Yovanno, Remy A.; Rahman, Sanim; Cao, David W.; Beckett, Morgan Q.; Patel, Milan H.; Bandak, Afif F.; Lau, Albert Y.",bioRxiv,817,20

We suggest recommendations for appropriate operation preparation, anesthetic management, and infection control for COVID-19 patients in operating rooms. Current Concepts Surgeries must be performed in an airborne infection isolation room, such as a negative-pressure operating room. It is recommended that scheduled surgeries for COVID-19 patients be postponed to an acceptable extent, with the exception of emergency cases. Moreover, the number of medical staff participating in the surgery should be minimized. Medical staffs should practice proper hand hygiene and wear an appropriate level of personal protective equipment depending on the infection risk. While performing surgery and inducing anesthesia in COVID-19 patients, endotracheal intubation should be performed by trained anesthesiologists with a video laryngoscope, preferably using high-efficiency viral filters, which can prevent contamination in the anesthesia machine. Use of disposable equipment or COVID-19 patient-specific devices is recommended to prevent the spread of infection, but instruments that require sharing among multiple patients must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected before their use for the next patient. Discussion and Conclusion: Medical staff performing surgeries for COVID-19 patients are at very high risk of infection. Therefore, the use of appropriate personal protective equipment, high-efficiency viral filters in breathing circuits during anesthesia, and disinfection of contaminated equipment after the operation are mandatory.","Seong Su, Lee Su Jin Kim Jong Eun Jung Gunn Hee Kim Mi Young Kwon Mi Jung Yun",Journal of the Korean Medical Association / Taehan Uisa Hyophoe Chi,817,24

Clinical trials have shown SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to be highly efficacious against both disease and infection. However, those currently in use were primarily tested against early lineages. Data on vaccine effectiveness (VE) against variants of concern (VOC), including the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), remain limited. To examine the effectiveness of vaccination in Utah we compared the proportion of cases reporting vaccination to that expected at different VEs, then estimated the combined daily vaccine effectiveness using a field evaluation approach. Delta has rapidly outcompeted all other variants and, as of June 20th, represents 70% of all SARS-CoV-2 viruses sequenced in Utah. If we attribute the entire change in VE to the Delta variant, the estimated vaccine effectiveness against Delta would be 82% (95% CI: 78%, 85%). We show a modest reduction in vaccine effectiveness against COVID-19 in Utah corresponding to the expansion of the Delta lineage in the state. This reduction in the effectiveness of available vaccines correlated with the arrival of novel VOCs, rather than waning immunity, is highly concerning.","Keegan, L.; Truelove, S.

Methods: Relative search volumes (RSV) for the topics depression, anxiety, self-harm, suicide, suicidal ideation, loneliness, and abuse were obtained from Google Trends. We used graphical and time-series approaches to compare daily trends in searches for these topics against population measures of these outcomes recorded using validated scales (PHQ-9; GAD-7; UCLA-3) in a weekly survey (n=~70,000) of the impact COVID-19 on psychological and social experiences in the UK population (12/03/2020 to 21/08/ 2020). Results: Self-reported levels of depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, self-harm, loneliness and abuse decreased during the period studied. There was no evidence of an association between self-reported anxiety, self-harm, abuse and RSV on Google Trends. Trends in reported depression symptoms and suicidal ideation declined over the study period, whereas Google topic RSV increased (p=0.03 and p=0.04 respectively). There was some evidence that suicidal ideation searches preceded reported self-harm (p=0.05), but graphical evidence suggested this was an inverse association. However, there was statistical and graphical evidence that self-report and Google searches for loneliness (p<0.001) tracked one another. Limitations: No age/sex breakdown of Google Trends data are available. Survey respondents were not representative of the UK population and no pre-pandemic data were available. Conclusion: Google Trends data do not appear to be a useful indicator of changing levels of population mental health during a public health emergency, but may have some value as an indicator of loneliness.","Knipe, D.; Gunnell, D.; Evans, H.; John, A.; Fancourt, D.",,817,16

Objective: To assess the diagnostic sensitivity of a novel Beanguard gargleTM (BG)-based virus detection method for early diagnosis of COVID-19. Design: This clinical trial was conducted at Gunsan Medical Center, Namwon Medical Center, and Jeonbuk National University Hospital, between May 7 and July 7, 2021. Setting: Paired NPS and BG-based saliva specimens collected from COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals were analyzed using NPS-RT-PCR, BG-RT-PCR, and BG-Ag-RDTs. Participants: The study comprised 102 COVID-19-positive patients hospitalized after governmental screening process and 100 healthy individuals. Forty-five COVID-19 patients were sampled within 6 days of illness and 57 within 7-15 days; 27 were categorized as asymptomatic and 75, as symptomatic. Eight and 2 patients carried the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta variants, respectively. Intervention: The diagnostic performances of BG-Ag-RDT, BG-RT-PCR, and NPS-RT-PCR for detecting SARS-CoV-2 were compared. Main outcomes: The sensitivities of BG-Ag-RDT and BG-RT-PCR towards salivary viral detection were highly concordant, with no discrimination between symptomatic, asymptomatic, or SARS-CoV-2 variant cases. Results: Among total participants (mean age, 43.7 years), 51% were women. BG-Ag-RDTs showed high sensitivity (97.8%, [95% CI, 88.4% to 99.6%]) and specificity (100%, [95% CI, 96.3% to 100%) in 45 patients within 6 days of illness and could detect all cases of SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta variants. In 11 asymptomatic early-stage cases, both BG-Ag-RDTs and BG-RT-PCR showed excellent sensitivity and specificity of 100% (95% CI, 74.1% to 100% and 95% CI, 20.7% to 100%, respectively). The interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and truncated canavalin, an active ingredient from bean extract (BE) and the ultrastructural features of SARS-CoV-2 particles coated with BE were observed. The detachment of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain from hACE2 increased as the BE concentration increased, allowing the release of the virus from hACE2 for early diagnosis. Conclusions and Relevance: Using BG-based saliva remarkably enhances the Ag-RDT diagnostic performance as an alternative to NPS and enables rapid and accurate COVID-19 self-testing and mass screening, supporting efficient COVID-19 management.

The aim of this medical student project was to examine the entire care pathway of women undergoing a general anaesthetic for caesarean section (CS) and introduce interventions to improve care. The first element included optimising rates of first-time intubation;the second involved optimisation of post-op analgesia;the third investigated follow-up for women who had difficult/failed intubations perinatally. Methods: A blended methodology was used: traditional ’PDSA’ quality improvement methods were employed with appreciative inquiry (AI). AI is an approach to organisational improvement that focuses on strengths and assets, rather than the traditional approach of focussing only on adverse incidents or failures. On account of COVID, planned face-to- face interviews and direct observation of practice could not proceed. Questions where therefore emailed to all staff. Questions were appreciative and thus focussed the responder on situations where care had gone well, as well as identifying areas for improvement. Stakeholders were actively encouraged to be creative and submit their ideas for improvement as part of the co-development of the service. Results: Regarding improving rates of successful intubation, 23 anaesthetists and ODP’s responded. The most important factors in successful intubation were thought to be: systematic approach, patient positioning;equipment preparation and a calm environment. Interestingly, ’leadership’ and ’procedural skill’ were mentioned least frequently. Suggestions for enhancing safety included clearly communicated plans for difficult/failed intubations. Sixty-five percent of respondents requested further teaching on obstetric difficult airway management;with suggestions such as 30 second simulation drills, revision of OAA/DAS and changing attitudes towards obstetric anaesthesia so that trainees are less fearful. The post-operative questionnaire gained 31 responses. The current post-CS advice and leaflet was felt to be inadequate (58%). The need for improved advice on pain management and activity was highlighted. Common practice following difficult intubation included face-to-face discussions with the patient and logging on the Difficult Airway Society database. Some wrote to the GP. Discussion: Based on the findings, a number of action plans have been implemented: 1) Regular 30 second MDT simulated intubation drills 2) new easy-read, obstetric intubation prompt (to be used in conjunction with OAA/DAS flowchart) to be visible in maternity theatres 3) Generation of rapid pre- intubation checklist 4) Publication of a new leaflet to address pain control and activity post LSCS, to include helpful quotes from past patients. 5) Production of a checklist to ensure standardisation of process for women who have had difficult/failed intubation.","Crossingham, G.; Dalton, G.; Harris, T.; Okunola, R.; Phu, E.; Smith, M.; Tharmaseelan, A.",International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia,817,16

Reported suPAR values have however varied dramatically depending on which assay is used. Comparing suPAR assays and their ability to discriminate risk is crucial for the Nephrology and overall research community to guide assay choice and inform interpretation of findings. To that end we measured suPAR in 3 different major cohorts (Malmo Diet and Cancer Study, n=4637; Jackson Heart Study, n=1905; and the Emory Cardiovascular Biobank, n=487) using two different methods in each cohort, encompassing the most commonly used approaches (immunoassays and proteomics). We find dramatic differences between assays; with notably poor correlations between immunoassays and proteomic approaches (r=0.2-0.5). Proteomics-based suPAR measures very poor discriminatory ability for cardiovascular and incident kidney disease. Amongst the immunoassays, the suPARnostic assay reported the highest values and had the strongest discriminatory ability.","Hayek, S.; Raffield, L. M.; Gao, Y.; Engstrom, G.; Quyyumi, A.

To better characterize a successful vaccination response, we performed longitudinal (days 0, 5, 7, 10, and 14 after Boostrix vaccination) analysis of the single cell transcriptome as well as the B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoire (scBCR-rep) in plasma cells of an immunized donor and compared it with baseline B cell characteristics as well as flow cytometry findings. Based on the flow cytometry knowledge and literature findings, we discriminated individual B cell subsets in the transcriptomics data and traced over-time maturation of plasmablasts/plasma cells (PB/PCs) and identified the pathways associated with the plasma cell maturation. We observed that the repertoire in PB/PCs differed from the baseline B cell repertoire e.g. regarding expansion of unique clones in post-vaccination visits, high usage of IGHG1 in expanded clones, increased class switching events post-vaccination represented by clonotypes spanning multiple IGHC classes and positive selection of CDR3 sequences over time. Importantly, the Variable gene family-based clustering of BCRs represented a similar measure as the gene-based clustering, however, certainly improved the clustering of BCRs, as BCRs from duplicated Variable gene families could be clustered together. Finally, we developed a query tool to dissect the immune response to the components of Boostrix vaccine. Using this tool, we could identify the BCRs related to anti-tetanus and anti-pertussis toxoid. Collectively, we developed a workflow which allows description of key features of an ongoing immune response, such as activation of PB/PCs, Ig class switching, somatic hypermutation, and clonal expansion, all of which are hallmarks of antigen exposure.","Khatri, Indu; Diks, Annieck M.; van den Akker, Erik B.; Oosten, Liesbeth E.M.; Zwaginga, Jaap Jan; Reinders, Marcel J.T.; van Dongen, Jacques J.M.; Berkowska, Magdalena A.",bioRxiv,817,1

The study was carriedoutas a partof projectfor assessing population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 among the population of Russian Federation using unified methodology developed by Rospotrebnadzor, with the participation of the Research Institute for Epidemiology and Microbiology named by Pasteur, and taking into account the recommendations of the WHO. The work involved 2907 volunteers, selected by the online survey and randomization by age and territory. All volunteers were divided into 7 age groups: 1–17, 18–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70 and older (70+), including a total 246–449 people. Population immunity testing was carried out during the formation of groups (1st stage), and then twice more, with the interval of 6–8 weeks. Serum was obtained from venous blood samples obtained from volunteers, in which antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid were determined by the enzyme immunoassay. The results were analyzed by methods of nonparametric statistics: median, interquartile range, rank correlation coefficient were calculated in the Excel statistical package. The confidence interval to seroprevalence indicators (95% CI) was calculated using the WinPepi statistical package (version 11.65). The statistical significance of the differences was assessed with a probability level of p ≤ 0.05. Results. The seroprevalence of the population of the Krasnoyarsk Territory during the 5-month period of seromonitoring had increased 3.3 times from 12.8% (95% CI 11.3–14.4) to 41.7% (95% CI 39.4–4.0), while the grouping by age had not revealedany peculiarities throughoutthe study. The trendtowards a decrease in the incidence was formedon the 6thweekof2021.

Phase inversion is a readily scalable technique for the production of porous films and is compatible with a large number of polymers. As such, the potential for phase inversion to produce comparable air-filtration masks, and filters in general, was herein investigated. Polymer solutions based on various PVDF-types, solvents and additives were prepared and cast onto a widely available industrial type of supporting fabric. From the various solvents and additives tested, only DMF and Tamisolve® NxG-based solutions with LiCl as an additive resulted in filters with suitable pore size and acceptable pore size distribution. The effects of polymer and additive concentration were investigated through SEM-based observation of the pore size and pore size distribution analysis via porometry. As expected, phase inversion proved to be a versatile tool to tune and control the pore size. Porometry-based comparison of the produced filters with a commercial surgical and FFP2-mask showed that comparable pore sizes could be easily obtained.

Fast, reliable, and easily accessible clinical assessment of the severity of the disease can help in allocating and prioritizing resources to reduce mortality. The objective of the study was to develop and validate an early scoring tool to stratify the risk of death using readily available complete blood count (CBC) biomarkers. A retrospective study was conducted on twenty-three CBC blood biomarkers for predicting disease mortality for 375 COVID-19 patients admitted to Tongji Hospital, China from January 10 to February 18, 2020. Machine learning based key biomarkers among the CBC parameters as the mortality predictors were identified. A multivariate logistic regression-based nomogram and a scoring system was developed to categorize the patients in three risk groups (low, moderate, and high) for predicting the mortality risk among COVID-19 patients. Lymphocyte count, neutrophils count, age, white blood cell count, monocytes (%), platelet count, red blood cell distribution width parameters collected at hospital admission were selected as important biomarkers for death prediction using random forest feature selection technique. A CBC score was devised for calculating the death probability of the patients and was used to categorize the patients into three sub-risk groups: low (<=5%), moderate (>5%and <=50%), and high (>50%), respectively.

Due to the lack of definitive etiological therapeutics currently, effective disease monitoring is of high clinical value for better healthcare and management of the large number of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we recruited 37 COVID-19 patients, collected 176 blood samples upon diagnosis and during treatment, and analyzed cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in these samples. We report gross abnormalities in cfDNA of COVID-19 patients, including elevated GC content, altered molecule size and end motif patterns. More importantly, such cfDNA characteristics reflect patient-specific physiological conditions during treatment. Further analysis on tissue origin tracing of cfDNA reveals frequent tissue injuries in COVID-19 patients, which is supported by clinical diagnoses. Hence, we demonstrate the translational merit of cfDNA as valuable analyte for effective disease monitoring, as well as tissue injury assessment in COVID-19 patients.","Jin, X.; Wang, Y.; Xu, J.; Li, Y.; Cheng, F.; Luo, Y.; Zhou, H.; Lin, S.; Xiao, F.; Zhang, L.; Lin, Y.; Zhang, Z.; Jin, Y.; Zheng, F.; Chen, W.; Zhu, A.; Tao, Y.; Zhao, J.; Kuo, T.; Li, L.; Wen, L.; Ou, R.; Li, F.; Lin, L.; Zhang, Y.; Sun, J.; Yuan, H.; Zhuang, Z.; Sun, H.; Chen, Z.; Li, J.; Zhuo, J.; Chen, D.; Zhang, S.; Sun, Y.; Wei, P.; Yuan, J.; Xu, T.; Yang, H.; Wang, J.; Xu, X.; Zhong, N.; Xu, Y.; Sun, K.",,817,16

We aim to synthesize the existing literature on the true SARS-CoV-2 excess deaths and infection fatality rates (IFR) in India, through a systematic search followed by viable meta-analysis. We then provide updated epidemiological model-based estimates of the wave 1, wave 2 and combined IFRs using an extension of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model, using data from April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, the databases PubMed, Embase, Global Index Medicus, as well as BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and SSRN for preprints (accessed through iSearch), were searched on July 3, 2021 (with results verified through August 15, 2021). Altogether using a two-step approach, 4,765 initial citations were screened resulting in 37 citations included in the narrative review and 19 studies with 41 datapoints included in the quantitative synthesis. Using a random effects model with DerSimonian-Laird estimation, we meta-analyze IFR1 which is defined as the ratio of the total number of observed reported deaths divided by the total number of estimated infections and IFR2 (which accounts for death underreporting in the numerator of IFR1). For the latter, we provide lower and upper bounds based on the available range of estimates of death undercounting, often arising from an excess death calculation. The primary focus is to estimate pooled nationwide estimates of IFRs with the secondary goal of estimating pooled regional and state-specific estimates for SARS-CoV-2 related IFRs in India. We also try to stratify our empirical results across the first and the second wave. In tandem, we present updated SEIR model estimates of IFRs for waves 1, 2, and combined across the waves with observed case and death count data from April 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Results For India countrywide, underreporting factors (URF) for cases (sourced from serosurveys) range from 14.3-29.1 in the four nationwide serosurveys; URFs for deaths (sourced from excess deaths reports) range from 4.4-11.9 with cumulative excess deaths ranging from 1.79-4.9 million (as of June 2021). Nationwide pooled IFR1 and IFR2 estimates for India are 0.097% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.067 - 0.140) and 0.365% (95% CI: 0.264 - 0.504) to 0.485% (95% CI: 0.344 - 0.685), respectively, again noting that IFR2 changes as excess deaths estimates vary. Among the included studies in this meta-analysis, the IFR1 generally appear to decrease over time from the earliest study end date to the latest study end date (from 4 June 2020 to 6 July 2021, IFR1 changed from 0.199 to 0.055%), whereas a similar trend is not as readily evident for IFR2 due to the wide variation in excess death estimates (from 4 June 2020 to 6 July 2021, IFR2 ranged from (0.290-1.316) to (0.241-0.651) %). Nationwide SEIR model-based combined estimates for IFR1 and IFR2 are 0.101% (95% CI: 0.097 - 0.116) and 0.367% (95% CI: 0.358 - 0.383), respectively, which largely reconcile with the empirical findings and concur with the lower end of the excess death estimates. An advantage of such epidemiological models is the ability to produce daily estimates with updated data with the disadvantages being that these estimates are subject to numerous assumptions, arduousness of validation and not directly using the available excess death data. Whether one uses empirical data or model-based estimation, it is evident that IFR2 is at least 3.6 times more than IFR1. Conclusion When incorporating case and death underreporting, the meta-analyzed cumulative infection fatality rate in India varies from 0.36%-0.48%, with a case underreporting factor ranging from 25-30 and a death underreporting factor ranging from 4-12. This implies, by June 30, 2021, India may have seen nearly 900 million infections and 1.7-4.9 million deaths when the reported numbers stood at 30.4 million cases and 412 thousand deaths (covid19india.org) with an observed case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.35%. We reiterate the need for timely and disaggregated infection and fatality data to examine the burden of the virus by age and other demographics. Large degrees of nationwide and state-specific death undercounting reinforce the call to improve death reporting within India.","Zimmermann, L.; Bhattacharya, S.; Purkayastha, S.; Kundu, R.; Bhaduri, R.; Ghosh, P.; Mukherjee, B.",,817,1

However, there are evidences of a very high proportion of asymptomatic patients. In this situation, in order to estimate the real number of infected (and to estimate the lethality rate), it should be necessary to run a properly designed sample survey through which it would be possible to calculate the probability of inclusion and hence draw sound probabilistic inference. Unfortunately, the survey run by the Italian Statistical Institute encountered many field difficulties. Some researchers proposed estimates of the total prevalence based on various approaches, including epidemiologic models, time series and the analysis of data collected in countries that faced the epidemic in earlier times. In this paper, we propose to estimate the prevalence of Covid-19 in Italy by reweighting the available official data published by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità so as to obtain a more representative sample of the Italian population. Reweighting is a procedure commonly used to artificially modify the sample composition so as to obtain a distribution which is more similar to the population. In this paper, we will use post-stratification of the official data, in order to derive the weights necessary for reweighting the sample results, using age and gender as post-stratification variables, thus obtaining more reliable estimation of prevalence and lethality. Specifically, for Italy, we obtain a prevalence of 9%. The proposed methodology represents a reasonable approximation while waiting for more reliable data obtained with a properly designed national sample survey and that it could be further improved if more data were made available.","Bassi, F; Arbia, G; Falorsi, P D",Sci Total Environ,817,20

Given the modifiable nature of electronic cigarettes and the delivery of high concentrations of nicotine, we investigate whether electronic cigarette vaping has the potential to increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We exposed BEAS-2B cells (bronchial epithelium transformed with Ad12-SV40 2B) and primary small airway epithelial cells (SAECs) to electronic cigarette aerosol condensates produced from propylene glycol/vegetable glycerin or commercially bought e-liquid (±added nicotine) and cigarette smoke extract to investigate if electronic cigarette exposure, like cigarette smoke, increases the expression of ACE2 in lung epithelial cells. In BEAS-2B cells, cytotoxicity (CCK-8), membrane integrity (LDH), and ACE2 protein expression (immunofluorescence) were measured for both 4- and 24 h treatments in BEAS-2B cells and 4 h in SAECs; ACE2 gene expression was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for 4 h treatment in BEAS-2B cells. Nicotine-free condensates and higher concentrations of nicotine-containing condensates were cytotoxic to BEAS-2B cells. Higher LDH release and reduced membrane integrity were seen in BEAS-2B cells treated for 24 h with higher concentrations of nicotine-containing condensates. ACE2 protein expression was observably increased in all treatments compared to cell controls, particularly for 24 h exposures. ACE2 gene expression was significantly increased in cells exposed to the locally bought e-liquid condensate with high nicotine concentration and cigarette smoke extract compared with cell controls. Our study suggests that vaping alone and smoking alone can result in an increase in lung ACE2 expression. Vaping and smoking are avoidable risk factors for COVID-19, which, if avoided, could help reduce the number of COVID-19 cases and the severity of the disease. This is the first study to utilize electronic cigarette aerosol condensates, novel and developed in our laboratory, for investigating ACE2 expression in human airway epithelial cells.","McAlinden, Kielan Darcy; Lu, Wenying; Ferdowsi, Parisa Vahidi; Myers, Stephen; Markos, James; Larby, Josie; Chia, Collin; Weber, Heinrich C; Haug, Greg; Eapen, Mathew Suji; Sohal, Sukhwinder Singh",,817,22

Methods: A retrospective analysis of 91 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital from January 22 to 30, 2020 was performed including 39 males and 52 females, with a median age of 50 (33-62) years,then their clinical features and HRCT characteristics were analyzed. Results: The main clinical presentations included fever in 70 cases and cough in 57 cases(mainly dry cough in 39 cases). The first time HRCT showed that 24 cases with COVID-19 were normal, however other 67 cases were abnormal. The ground glass opacity in the lung on HRCT was found in 65 cases, including 64 cases with dilated blood vessel crossing the lesion, 50 cases with thickened adjacent pleura, and 47 cases with thickening of interstitial septum. The patchy opacity was seen in 42 cases, and no enlarged lymph nodes were observed in all patients. As for the lesion distribution, there were two cases with bilateral diffuse changes, 57 cases with multiple lesions, 8 cases with the lesion in only one lobe. The lesions were mainly located under the pleura area in 46 cases, including 39 cases in the lower lobe and other 7 cases in the upper lobe.

METHODS: Participants included child-parent dyads seen in a PED following the state's issuance of mandatory stay-at-home orders on 19 March 2020. A total of 351 children age 0-25 years and 335 parents enrolled in the study. Parents provided baseline demographic data and completed standardised surveys that assessed aspects of parental and child anxiety and parental health, as well as child new-onset maladaptive behaviours. Children &#8805;8 years of age completed surveys that assessed child anxiety. FINDINGS: Parents reported the new onset of maladaptive behaviours in children during the pandemic with frequencies up to 43%. Bivariate analysis identified predictors such as child anxiety (t(96) = -2.04, P = 0.044) as well as parental variables such as state anxiety (t(190) = -4.91, P < 0.001) and parental sensitivity to anxiety (t(243) = -3.19, P = 0.002). A logistic regression model identified parent mental health and COVID-19 anxiety as predictors of new onset maladaptive behaviours in children (X2 (6) = 42.514, P < 0.001). Specifically, every unit change in parental anxiety of COVID-19 was associated with a unit increase in maladaptive behaviours in children.

A common issue in all of these crises seems to be the issue of ""trust."" Official authorities, including the Iranian President, ministers, and the judiciary system, tried to gain people's trust by either changing policies or developing new ones. In August 2019, the new law on crisis management in Iran went into effect and the issue of public donation has been considered, too. Also, in their response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Iranian officials ordered all sectors to cooperate with the Ministry of Health and provide it with all necessary facilities. Therefore, it seems that new policies are still needed to overcome mistrust in Iran at times of emergency. Developing a policy on donation management was the first step, and there are several factors that could have contributed to the perception of the mistrust and failure in emergency missions. Mistrust can be the result of different causes, including but not limited to lack of knowledge on capabilities and efficiencies of humanitarian organizations, engagement of a wide range of organizations from different categories, extension of mistrust of an organization to other emergency organizations in the area or all of operation, lack of unity in emergency response, and poor public relations.","Seddighi, Hamed",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,817,21

The disease has enormous potential for transmissibility and requires drastic governmental measures, guided by social distancing and the use of protective devices (gloves, masks, and facial shields). Once the need for admission to the ICU is characterized, a set of essentially supportive therapies are adopted in order to offer multi-organic support and allow time for healing. Typically, patients who require ventilatory support have bilateral infiltrates in the chest X-ray and chest computed tomography showing ground-glass pulmonary opacities and subsegmental consolidations. Invasive ventilatory support should not be postponed in a scenario of intense ventilatory distress.

MATERIAL AND METHODS There were 189 patients who underwent the qualification procedure to lung transplantation in the Department of Cardiac and Vascular Surgery of the University Clinical Center in Gdansk, Poland in the years 2019 and 2020. The control group consisted of 12 patients transplanted in 2019, and the study group consisted of 16 patients transplanted in 2020. RESULTS During 2019, the qualification process was performed in 102 patients with pulmonary end-stage diseases. In 2020, despite the 3-month lockdown related to organizational changes in the hospital, 87 qualification processes were performed. The mortality rate of patients on the waiting list in 2020 was 14.3% (6 patients died), and during 2019 the rate was also 14.3% (4 patients died). Donor qualifications were according to ISHLT criteria. The distribution of donors in both years was similar. There was no relationship between the geographic area of residence and source of donors. In 2019, all 12 patients had double-lung transplant. In 2020, 11 patients had double-lung transplant and 5 patients had single-lung transplant. There was no difference in ventilation time and PGD aside from a shorter ICU stay in 2020.

The essay first raises questions about the unequal distribution of ‘saveability’ in the Indian context (but this can also apply to others). It asks who cannot be included in the frame of ‘human life’ that underlies the solutions offered for protecting lives in the pandemic. Second, the essay offers a description of the migrant crisis in India that has ensued in the pandemic. Following that description, the essay focuses on three problem-spaces or aporias that the pandemic has pried open and that call for a more politically complex, contextually sensitive, and humane response to the management of the virus: unequal temporalities, the dilemma of im/mobility, and the challenge of recording death.","Shome, Raka",Cultural Studies,817,16

In this study, we explored the epidemiological characteristics, clinical patterns, and laboratory and imaging findings of pediatric patients with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: From March 7 to March 30, 2020, there were a total of 35 patients who had confirmed COVID-19 infection by laboratory virus nucleic acid test (RT-PCR) assay with throat swab samples or typical chest CT manifestation compatible with COVID-19, in addition to a history of close contact with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in family members. Information recorded included demographic data, medical history, exposure history, underlying comorbidities, symptoms, signs, laboratory findings and radiologic assessments, severity of disease, treatment, and mortality. Results: The median age of the patients was 7.5 years (IQR=4-11; range=4 months to 15 years). A total of 63% were male. Cough was present in 80% of the patients, followed by fever (77%), nausea or vomiting (29%), diarrhea (26%), shortness of breath (29%), headache (20%), and myalgia (14%). Lymphopenia was present in 43% of the patients, thrombocytopenia in 9%, neutopenia in 8%, and leucopenia in 26%. We reported severe pneumonia in 40% of the hospitalized patients and 18 (51%) had underlying diseases. Of 35 patients, 11 had positive RT-PCR results (31%). The chest CT images of 24 patients (69%) suggested COVID-19, while their RT-PCR assays from throat swab samples were negative. Conclusion: This study demonstrates different clinical findings of pediatrics compared to the previous reports of children. Since a high rate of false negative RT-PCR test was observed, early detection of children with COVID-19 infection by CT is conducive to reasonable management and early treatment.","Mahmoudi, Shima; Mehdizadeh, Mehrzad; Shervin Badv, Reza; Navaeian, Amene; Pourakbari, Babak; Rostamyan, Maryam; Sharifzadeh Ekbatani, Meisam; Eshaghi, Hamid; Abdolsalehi, Mohammad Reza; Alimadadi, Hosein; Movahedi, Zahra; Mamishi, Setareh",Infect Drug Resist,817,16

However, inactivated virus can be safely handled in BSL-2 laboratories. Gamma irradiation is one of the methods used to inactivate a variety of pathogens including viruses. Objective: To determine the radiation dose required to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and its effect, if any, on subsequent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Methods: Aliquots of SARS-CoV-2 virus culture were subjected to increasing doses of gamma radiation to determine the proper dose required to inactivate the virus. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) data from irradiated samples was compared with that of the non-irradiated samples to assess the effect of gamma radiation on PCR assay. Results: A radiation dose of 1 Mrad was required to completely inactivate 106.5TCID50/ml of SARS-CoV-2. The influence of gamma radiation on PCR sensitivity was inversely related and dose-dependent up to 0.5 Mrad with no further reduction thereafter. Conclusion: Gamma irradiation can be used as a reliable method to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 with minimal effect on subsequent PCR assay.","Leung, Anders; Tran, Kaylie; Audet, Jonathan; Lavineway, Sherisse; Bastien, Nathalie; Krishnan, Jay",Appl.

The Japan Triage and Acuity Scale (JTAS) is frequently used for emergency patients, and the ESI has not been evaluated against the JTAS in Japan. This study aimed to examine the decision accuracy of the ESI for simulated clinical scenarios among nursing specialists in Japan compared with the JTAS. METHOD: A parallel group randomized trial was conducted. In total, 23 JTAS-trained triage nurses from 10 Japanese emergency departments were randomly assigned to the ESI or the JTAS group. Nurses independently assigned triage categories to 80 emergency cases for the assessment of interrater agreement. RESULTS: Interrater agreement between the expert and triage nurses was &#954;â¯=â¯0.82 (excellent) in the ESI group and &#954;â¯=â¯0.74 (substantial) in the JTAS group. In addition, interrater agreement by acuity was level 2â¯=â¯0.42 (moderate) in the ESI group and level 2â¯=â¯0.31 (fair) in the JTAS group. Interrater agreement for triage decisions was classified in a higher category in the ESI group than in the JTAS Scale group at level 2. Triage decisions based on the ESI in Japan maintained the same level of interrater agreement and sensitivity as those in other countries. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the ESI can be introduced in Japan, despite its different emergency medical background compared with other countries.","Takaoka, Koichi; Ooya, Kensuke; Ono, Masaya; Kakeda, Takahiro",,817,16

Methods: Using publicly available data (accessed April 13, 2020), predictors of COVID-19 cases and deaths were compared between disproportionately (&#8805;13%) black and all other (<13% black) counties. Rate ratios were calculated, and population attributable fractions were estimated using COVID-19 cases and deaths via zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. National maps with county-level data and an interactive scatterplot of COVID-19 cases were generated. Results: Nearly 90% of disproportionately black counties (656/677) reported a case and 49% (330/677) reported a death versus 81% (1987/2465) and 28% (684/2465), respectively, for all other counties. Counties with higher proportions of black people have higher prevalence of comorbidities and greater air pollution. Counties with higher proportions of black residents had more COVID-19 diagnoses (Rate Ratio (RR): 1.24, 95% confidence interval: 1.17-1.33) and deaths (RR: 1.18, 95% confidence interval: 1.00-1.40), after adjusting for county-level characteristics such as age, poverty, comorbidities, and epidemic duration. COVID-19 deaths were higher in disproportionally black rural and small metro counties. The population attributable fraction of COVID-19 diagnosis due to lack of health insurance was 3.3% for counties with less than 13% black residents and 4.2% for counties with greater than or equal to 13% black residents. Conclusions: Nearly 20% of U.S. counties are disproportionately black, and they accounted for 52% of COVID-19 diagnoses and 58% of COVID-19 deaths nationally. County-level comparisons can both inform COVID-19 responses and identify epidemic hot spots.

In most cases, SARS-CoV-2 infection results in the development of viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, known as ""coronavirus disease 2019"" or COVID-19. Intriguingly, besides the respiratory tract, COVID-19 affects other organs and systems of the human body. COVID-19 patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease have a higher risk of death, and SARS-CoV-2 infection itself may cause myocardial inflammation and injury. One possible explanation of such phenomena is the fact that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor required for viral entry. ACE2 is expressed in the cells of many organs, including the heart. ACE2 functions as a carboxypeptidase that can cleave several endogenous substrates, including angiotensin II, thus regulating blood pressure and vascular tone. It remains largely unknown if the SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the enzymatic properties of ACE2, thereby contributing to cardiovascular complications in patients with COVID-19. Here, we demonstrate that ACE2 cleavage of des-Arg9-bradykinin substrate analog is markedly accelerated, while cleavage of angiotensin II analog is minimally affected by the binding of spike protein. These findings may have implications for a better understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.","Kiseleva, Anna A; Troisi, Elizabeth M; Hensley, Scott E; Kohli, Rahul M; Epstein, Jonathan A",,817,24

Todos os animais selecionados foram submetidos aos exames ortopédicos específicos, sendo diagnosticada ruptura completa do LCCr pelos testes de gaveta e de compressão tibial. Realizaram-se exames radiográficos convencionais e em posição de estresse das articulações. A técnica TR foi modificada utilizando-se o fio de náilon substituindo o fio de fibra empregado na técnica original, facilitando a disponibilidade de obtenção do material. Houve também modificação na origem da perfuração do túnel tibial, sendo realizada imediatamente cranial ao sulco do tendão extensor digital longo. Todos os cães foram submetidos ao exame radiográfico tanto no pós-operatório imediato como no tardio. Aos 30 dias após a intervenção cirúrgica, os pacientes apresentavam claudicação nos membros pélvicos operados de grau discreto a moderado. Foi observado discreto movimento de gaveta cranial em 60% das articulações acometidas. Aos três meses após o procedimento cirúrgico, os animais apresentaram ausência de dor e discreta redução na amplitude dos movimentos articulares. Em duas articulações (20%) observou-se discreto deslocamento cranial da tíbia no teste de gaveta. Nesta fase, 80% dos membros avaliados apresentavam apoio normal. Um ano após a intervenção cirúrgica, observou-se ao exame radiográfico discreta progressão da doença articular degenerativa em 50% das articulações operadas. Das oito articulações avaliadas a longo prazo, em apenas um membro operado observou-se discreta claudicação com reduzida transferência de peso para o membro contralateral. Os demais membros pélvicos avaliados (87,5%) demonstraram ausência de claudicação e adequada recuperação da função articular. Concluiu-se que a técnica cirúrgica extracapsular TR modificada mostrou-se efetiva como opção de tratamento para doença do LCCr em cães de porte pequeno e médio, não apresentando complicações. As modificações do fio cirúrgico e da perfuração da tíbia na técnica TR parecem ter efeitos positivos na estabilização da articulação do joelho.(AU)","Abreu, Thais G. M; Muzzi, Leonardo A.

INTRODUCTION: Management of the severe thoracolumbar (TL) spine fracture-dislocation injuries have been further complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The need to optimize resources and minimize the personnel in the operating room (OR) led us to develop a novel technique to reduce TL fracture-dislocations (AO type-C) using an orthopedic distractor device (ODD). METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at a tertiary care spine center with a study duration from March 2020 to May 2020 coinciding with the nationwide lockdown and travel restrictions imposed in view of the COVID-19 crisis. Only patients with AO type C fracture-dislocation managed using the ODD operated by a single surgeon were included in the study. RESULTS: Of 12 cases, the most commonly affected level was D12-L1. Nine patients were American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) A at presentation, two patients were AIS B, and one AIS C. The mean operative time was 125 min and mean blood loss was 454 ml. Eight patients remained AIS A, one patient improved from AIS B to C. Two patients became independent walkers, one remained AIS B. The post-operative VAS score improved to a mean value of 2.33. The improvement in kyphosis was 26.24° immediate postoperatively and maintained at 25.9°, percentage height loss reduced to 2.75% immediate postoperatively and maintained at 3.16% at 3 months follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Management of TL fracture-dislocations in COVID times of health care resource scarcity can be challenging. Single surgeon with ODD is a useful technique for achieving good results in these injuries.","Mallepally, Abhinandan Reddy; Marathe, Nandan; Rustagi, Tarush; Mohapatra, Bibhudendu; Mahanjan, Rajat; Das, Kalidutta",Br J Neurosurg,817,24

OBJECTIVES: Our team aimed to harness new COVID-19-related reliance on digital clinical support tools to re-envision how all clinical guidelines are stored and accessed in our ED. METHODS: We used a design-thinking approach including empathizing, defining the problem, ideating, prototyping, and testing to develop a low-cost, homegrown clinical information hub: E*Drive. To measure impact, we compared web traffic on E*Drive to our legacy cloud-based folder system and conducted a survey of end-users using a validated health technology utilization instrument. RESULTS: Our final product, E*Drive, is a centralized clinical information hub storing everything from clinical guidelines to discharge resources. Clinical guidelines are standardized and housed within the high-traffic E*Drive platform to increase accessibility. Since launch, E*Drive has averaged 84 unique weekly users, compared with less than one weekly user on the legacy system. We surveyed 52 clinicians for a total response rate of 47%. Prior to the E*Drive rollout, 12.5% of ED clinicians felt confident accessing clinical information on the legacy system, whereas 76.6% of ED clinicians felt they could more easily access clinical information using E*Drive. CONCLUSION: The COVID pandemic revealed vulnerabilities within our information dissemination system and presented an opportunity to improve clinical information delivery. Centralized web-based clinical information hubs designed around the clinician end-user experience can increase clinical guideline access in the ED.","Schwartz, Hope E M; Stark, Nicholas R; Sowa, Cathleen S; Singh, Malini K; Peabody, Christopher R",J. emerg. med,817,24

The purpose of this study is to quantitatively determine the impact on cancer diagnostic service in public facilities across Hong Kong. Quantifying the temporal changes in the number of cancer diagnoses before, during, and after the outbreak is useful to establish the scale of the problem and assess if there has been an adequate level of response. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This is a retrospective cohort study using a territory-wide database in Hong Kong from 2017 to 2020, and consecutive specimens received for pathologic diagnosis in public laboratories in 41 hospitals were retrieved. RESULTS: In 2020, a total of 455,453 pathologic specimens were received, which amounted to a 15.5% reduction compared with the prior 3-year average (P < .001). An analysis of confirmed malignant pathologic diagnoses revealed a statistically significant reduction in colorectal (-10.0%; P < .001) and prostate (-19.7%; P < .001), nonsignificant reduction in lung (-3.0%; P = .0526), and a marginal but nonsignificant increase for breast (0.7%; P = .7592) regions. Based on time series projection data, the estimated missed cancers for the 3 regions with reduced investigations were colorectal (10.0%), lung (3.0%), and prostate (19.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Variable impact on actual malignant pathologic diagnoses based on 4 body regions was observed, with a statistically significant reduction in colorectal, lung, and prostate regions, and marginal but insignificant increase in breast regions.

Peer-reviewed randomized clinical trials of non-surgical interventions for adults with rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy were included. DATA EXTRACTION: The same 2 reviewers independently evaluated eligibility, extracted data and evaluated risk of bias of the included randomized clinical trials. A system to resolve any disagreements was established a priori. Short-term, medium-term and long-term outcomes for pain, shoulder function and calcific morphology related to rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy were extracted. Due to diversity in outcome measures a meta-analyses was not conducted. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of the 2,085 articles identified, 18 met the inclusion criteria, all of which had high risk of bias. Five non-surgical interventions were identified (extracorporeal shockwave therapy, ultrasound-guided percutaneous intervention, pulsed ultrasound, acetic acid iontophoresis, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation). CONCLUSION: There was moderate evidence for high-energy extracorporeal shockwave therapy over low-energy extracorporeal shockwave therapy for pain and function between 3 and 6 months, and over placebo for function in the first 6 months. There was moderate evidence for ultrasound-guided percutaneous intervention over medium/high-energy extracorporeal shockwave therapy for reduced pain and calcific morphology over a 1-year period.

METHODS: We searched relevant databases/websites (up to September 2020) and selected English-language RCT publications of remdesivir for COVID-19. We conducted meta-analysis using an inverse variance, random-effects model in addition to trial sequential analysis (TSA) for the efficacy outcomes: all-cause mortality, viral burden and clinical progression. Safety outcomes were diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for all outcomes. Statistical heterogeneity was calculated using the I2 statistic. RESULTS: We included five RCTs (7540 participants) from 7237 citations. Most (80%) were of an unclear to high risk of bias. There was no evidence of a significant improvement with remdesivir (100 mg, 10 days) regarding all-cause mortality (RR 0.94, CI 0.82-1.07; I2 = 0%; 4 RCTs; 7143 patients), clinical progression (RR 1.08, CI 0.99-1.18; I2 = 70.4%; 3 RCTs; 1692 patients), or diarrhoea (RR 0.82, CI 0.40-1.66; I2 = 0%; 2 RCTs; 630 patients). Nausea occurred more often with remdesivir (RR 2.77, CI 1.28-6.03; I2 = 0%; 2 RCTs; 630 patients). TSA showed that the required information size was not reached for firm conclusions to be drawn. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19. More high-quality RCTs are needed for a stronger evidence. Until then, remdesivir should remain an experimental drug for COVID-19.","Okoli, George N; Rabbani, Rasheda; Copstein, Leslie; Al-Juboori, Amenah; Askin, Nicole; Abou-Setta, Ahmed M",Infect Dis (Lond),817,1

In the literature, cutaneous symptoms related to the disease are generally emphasized. However, it is not yet known whether this new SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has entered our lives, plays a role in the etiopathogenesis of dermatological diseases.

The reason for the same months to be included in the study was to exclude seasonal effects on the diseases. After pandemic, the number of patients with Pityriasis rosea and Kawasaki disease increased significantly in patients who applied to the dermatology outpatient clinic. Our study is the first study showing Pityriasis rosea increase during the pandemic period. We think that this increase is related to HHV-6 reactivation.

Material and Methods A multi-center, retrospective and descriptive study was performed. A total of 140 patients with encrusted double J stents were collected from 5 different institutions. The novel Visual-Grading for Ureteral Encrusted Stents (V-GUES) classification system goes from A to D, increasing the severity of encrustation. Results Encrusted stents could be removed with a single intervention in 112 patients (86.8%). Type A and B encrusted stents could be successfully removed in all patients (100 % success). Type D stents had minor retrieval and stone-free rates (p = 0.006 and p<0.0001, respectively). Stone-free status was achieved after the first procedure in 89 patients (69%). Flexible ureteroscopy had a low success rate (77.7%) in type C stents (OR 0.21). Combined access had a 100 % success rate to retrieve type C encrusted stents and a 92.9% success rate for type D encrusted stents (OR 9.18). Type D stents were associated with more than one session needed to get the stent (OR: 0.11) and stones retrieved (OR 0.21). Conclusions The V-GUES grading system is associated with treatment success rates of encrusted stents retrieval and stone-free status. It is also associated with complications rate and the number of sessions needed to leave patients stent and stone free. The V-GUES classification could help counsel patients about the best treatment options and their outcomes.

The most current and widespread of these is SARS-CoV-2. The identification of CoVs with zoonotic potential in animal reservoirs suggests that additional outbreaks are likely to occur. Evidence suggests that neutralizing antibodies are important for protection against infection with CoVs. Monoclonal antibodies targeting conserved neutralizing epitopes on diverse CoVs can form the basis for prophylaxis and therapeutic treatments and enable the design of vaccines aimed at providing pan-coronavirus protection. To this end, we previously identified a neutralizing monoclonal antibody, CV3-25 that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 fusion machinery, neutralizes the SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant comparably to the ancestral Wuhan Hu-1 strain, cross neutralizes SARS-CoV-1 and displays cross reactive binding to recombinant proteins derived from the spike-ectodomains of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. Here, we show that the neutralizing activity of CV3-25 is also maintained against the Alpha, Delta and Gamma variants of concern as well as a SARS-CoV-like bat coronavirus with zoonotic potential by binding to a conserved linear peptide in the stem-helix region on sarbecovirus spikes. A 1.74[A] crystal structure of a CV3-25/peptide complex demonstrates that CV3-25 binds to the base of the stem helix at the HR2 boundary to an epitope that is distinct from other stem-helix directed neutralizing mAbs. Thus, CV3-25 defines a novel site of sarbecovirus vulnerability that will inform pan-CoV vaccine development.","Hurlburt, Nicholas; Homad, Leah; Siha, Irika; Jenewein, Madeleine F; MacCamy, Anna; Wan, Yu-Hsin; Boonyaratanakornkit, Jim; Sholukh, Anton M; Zhou, Panpan; Burton, Dennis; Andrabi, Raiees; Stamatatos, Leonidas; Pancera, Marie; McGuire, Andrew",,817,16

METHODS: Data from 1691 elderly residents and 1000 members of staff were retrospectively collected through interviewing the medical teams in 24 LTCFs and using the hospitals' electronic health recording systems. RESULTS: Elderly residents were predominantly female (64.8%) with a mean age of 83.0 years. SARS-CoV-2 detection among residents (226, 13.4%) was significantly higher than among staff members (87, 8.7%) (P < 0.001). Of the 226 infected residents, 37 (16.4%) were detected on a case-by-case basis due to their COVID-19 symptoms and 189 (83.6%) were detected through mass screening. Most (77.0%) had possible COVID-19 symptoms, including respiratory symptoms and signs (44.5%) and fever (46.5%); 23.0% were asymptomatic. A total of 116 (51.4%) patients received a course of oral hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (HCQ-AZM) for &#8805; 3 days; 47 (20.8%) died.

Therefore, it is important to keep track the number of patients being affected. The current system gives the computerized data in a collective way which is very difficult to analyze and predict the growth of disease in a particular area and in the world. Machine learning algorithms can be used to successfully map the disease and its progression to solve this problem. Machine Learning, a branch of computer science, is critical in correctly distinguishing patients with the condition by analyzing their chest X-ray photographs. Supervised Machine learning models with associated algorithms (like LR, SVR and Time series algorithms) to analyze data for regression and classification helps in training the model to predict the number of total number of global confirmed cases who will be prone to the disease in the upcoming days. In this proposed work, the overall dataset of the world is being collected, preprocessed and the number of confirmed cases up to a particular date are extracted which is given as the training set to the model. The model is being trained by supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the growth of cases in the upcoming days. The experimental setup with the above mentioned algorithms shows that Time series Holt's model outperforms Linear Regression and Support Vector Regression algorithms.","Gothai, E; Thamilselvan, R; Rajalaxmi, R R; Sadana, R M; Ragavi, A; Sakthivel, R",,817,23

With limited access to clinical specimens, animal models could advance our understanding of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) disease and viral persistence. Here, we summarize current findings on HIV-1 CNS infection from nonhuman primate (NHP) models and discuss their implications for improving pediatric clinical outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: SIV/SHIV can be found in the CNS of infant macaques within 48 h of challenge. Recent studies show an impermeable BBB during SIV infection, suggesting neuroinvasion in post-partum infection is likely not wholly attributed to barrier dysfunction. Histopathological findings reveal dramatic reductions in hippocampal neuronal populations and myelination in infected infant macaques, providing a link for cognitive impairments seen in pediatric cases. Evidence from humans and NHPs support the CNS as a functional latent reservoir, harbored in myeloid cells that may require unique eradication strategies. Studies in NHP models are uncovering early events, causes, and therapeutic targets of CNS disease as well as highlighting the importance of age-specific studies that capture the distinct features of pediatric HIV-1 infection.","Obregon-Perko, Veronica; Bricker, Katherine; Chahroudi, Ann",,817,3

TIGIT, an inhibitory receptor that interacts with CD155 and CD112 molecules, is considered as a checkpoint in T and NK cell activation. This receptor shares ligands with the co-stimulatory receptor DNAM-1 and with TACTILE. The aim of this work was to analyze the expression of DNAM-1, TIGIT and TACTILE in NK cells and T cell subsets in AML patients. Methods: We have studied 36 patients at the time of diagnosis of AML and 20 healthy volunteers. The expression of DNAM-1, TIGIT and TACTILE in NK cells and T cells, according to the expression of CD3 and CD56, was performed by flow cytometry. Results: NK cells, CD56- T cells and CD56+ T (NKT-like) cells from AML patients presented a reduced expression of DNAM-1 compared with healthy volunteers. An increased expression of TIGIT was observed in mainstream CD56- T cells. No differences were observed in the expression of TACTILE. Simplified presentation of incredibly complex evaluations (SPICE) analysis of the co-expression of DNAM-1, TIGIT and TACTILE showed an increase in NK and T cells lacking DNAM-1 and co-expressing TIGIT and TACTILE. Low percentages of DNAM-1-TIGIT+TACTILE+ NK cells and DNAM-1- TIGIT+TACTILE+ CD56- T cells were associated with a better survival of AML patients. Conclusions: The expression of DNAM-1 is reduced in NK cells and in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from AML patients compared with those from healthy volunteers. An increased percentage of NK and T cells lacking DNAM-1 and co-expressing TIGIT and TACTILE is associated with patient survival, supporting the role of TIGIT as a novel candidate for checkpoint blockade.","Valhondo, Isabel; Hassouneh, Fakhri; Lopez-Sejas, Nelson; Pera, Alejandra; Sanchez-Correa, Beatriz; Guerrero, Beatriz; Bergua, Juan M; Arcos, Maria Jose; Bañas, Helena; Casas-Avilés, Ignacio; Sanchez-Garcia, Joaquin; Serrano, Josefina; Martin, Carmen; Duran, Esther; Alonso, Corona; Solana, Rafael; Tarazona, Raquel",,817,5

Nafamostat has recently been reported as a therapeutic agent for COVID-19. However, there is a lack of information on the compatibility of nafamostat with the aforementioned drug classes. This study evaluated the physical compatibility of nafamostat with these drug classes. METHODS: Nafamostat was combined with 1-3 target drugs (fentanyl, morphine, midazolam, dexmedetomidine, and rocuronium). Fifteen physical compatibility tests were conducted. Nafamostat was dissolved in 5% glucose solution; the final concentration was 10 mg/mL. All other medications were diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride to obtain clinically relevant concentrations. The power of hydrogen (pH) of all medications was measured during each test. Compatibility tests were conducted with four test solutions wherein nafamostat and the target drugs were compounded at equal volume ratios (1:1, 1:1:1, or 1:1:1:1). Visual appearance, turbidity, and pH were evaluated immediately after mixing and at 1 and 3 hours. Physical incompatibilities were defined as gross precipitation, cloudiness, appearance of the Tyndall effect, or a turbidity change of &#8805;0.5 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) based on nafamostat. RESULTS: The mean pH of nafamostat was 3.13 ± 0.03. The combination of nafamostat, fentanyl, and dexmedetomidine had the highest pH (3.39 ± 0.01; 3 hours after mixing). All drugs were compatible with nafamostat until 3 hours after admixture, with a mean turbidity value of <0.03 NTU. CONCLUSIONS: Infusions combining nafamostat with the tested sedatives, analgesics, and muscle relaxants could be safely administered.","Kondo, Masayoshi; Nagano, Makihiko; Yoshida, Mariko; Yoshida, Naoki; Tagui, Naoya; Yoshida, Masato; Sugaya, Kazutoshi; Takase, Hisamitsu",J.

This work studies the UK labour market by analysing data from the online job board Reed.co.uk, using topic modelling and geo-inference methods to break down the data by sector and geography. I also study how the salary, contract type, and mode of work have changed since the COVID-19 crisis hit the UK in March. Overall, vacancies were down by 60 to 70% in the first weeks of lockdown. By the end of the year numbers had recovered somewhat, but the total job ad deficit is measured to be over 40%. Broken down by sector, vacancies for hospitality and graduate jobs are greatly reduced, while there were more care work and nursing vacancies during lockdown. Differences by geography are less significant than between sectors, though there is some indication that local lockdowns stall recovery and less badly hit areas may have experienced a smaller reduction in vacancies. There are also small but significant changes in the salary distribution and number of full time and permanent jobs.

The proposed method is based on measuring native fluorescence of FAV in 0.2 M borate buffer (pH 8.0) at 432 nm after excitation at 361 nm. There was a linear relationship between FAV concentration and relative fluorescence intensity over the range 40-280 ng/mL with limit of detection of 9.44 ng/mL and quantitation limit of 28.60 ng/mL. The method was successfully implemented for determination of FAV in its pharmaceutical formulation with mean % recovery of 99.26 ± 0.87. Moreover, the high sensitivity of the method allowed determination of FAV in spiked human plasma over a range of 48-192 ng/mL. The proposed spectrofluorimetric method was proved to be eco-friendly according to analytical eco-scale.","Megahed, Safa M; Habib, Ahmed A; Hammad, Sherin F; Kamal, Amira H",Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc,817,16

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of betaine hydrochloride addition to sow diets during gestation and lactation on suckling piglet's immunity and intestine microbiota composition. Forty Bama mini-pigs were randomly allocated into two groups and fed a basal diet (control group) and basal diet with 3.50 kg ton-1 betaine hydrochloride (betaine group) from day 3 after mating to day 21 of lactation. After 21 days of the delivery, 12 suckling piglets from each group with similar body weight were selected for sample collection. RESULTS: The results showed that maternal betaine hydrochloride addition decreased (P < 0.05) the plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945; in suckling piglets. Furthermore, dietary betaine hydrochloride addition in sow diets increased (P < 0.05) the villus height (VH) and VH to crypt depth ratio in the jejunum and ileum of suckling piglets. In the piglets' intestinal microbiota community, the relative abundances of Roseburia (P < 0.05) and Clostridium (P = 0.059) were lower in the betaine group than those in the control group. Moreover, betaine hydrochloride addition in sow diets decreased the colonic tyramine (P = 0.091) and skatole (P = 0.070) concentrations in suckling piglets. CONCLUSION: Betaine hydrochloride addition in sow diets enhanced the intestinal morphology, improved immunity, and altered intestinal microbiota of suckling piglets. These findings indicated that betaine hydrochloride addition in sow diets during gestation and lactation will impact suckling piglets' health. This article is protected by copyright.

MethodsWe used routinely collected surveillance and COVID-19 vaccination data to conduct a retrospective cohort study of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 infection incidence and vaccine effectiveness among LCTFs residents in eastern France between 15 January and 19 May 2021. Data from secondary RT-PCR screening were used to identify B.1.351 variants. FindingsIncluded in our analysis were 378 residents from five LCTFs: 287 (76%) females, with median (IQR) age of 89 (83-92) years. Two B.1.351 outbreaks took place in LTCFs in which more than 70% of residents had received two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, which included 11 cases of severe disease and six deaths among those who had received two doses. Vaccine effectiveness (95% CI) seven days after the second dose of vaccine was 49% (14-69) against any infection with B.1.351 and 86% (67-94) against severe forms of COVID-19. In multivariable analysis, females were less likely to develop severe forms of disease (IRR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.20-0.63). InterpretationWe observed reduced vaccine effectiveness associated with B.1.351, as well as B.1.351 outbreaks in two LTCFs among individuals who had received two doses of vaccine. Our findings highlight the need to maintain SARS-CoV-2 surveillance in these high-risk settings beyond the current COVID-19 mass vaccination campaign, and advocate for a booster vaccine dose prior to the next winter season.","Lefevre, Benjamin; Tondeur, Laura; Madec, Yoann; Grant, Rebecca; Lina, Bruno; Werf, Sylvie van der; Rabaud, Christian; Fontanet, Arnaud",,817,14

We provide foundational guiding principles and recommendations for intervention design and implementation for each component. Additionally, we discuss and propose how to structure and design pre-service teacher preparation and in-service teacher training and ongoing support, fortified by materials design and assessment, to help teachers determine where learners are in developmental progressions, move learners towards mastery, and differentiate and support learners who have fallen behind.

METHODS: CT image data of 187 COVID-19 patients were analyzed in the period of hospitalization. CT scanning was performed on admission and repeated every 3 days. The improvement time of clinical symptoms and the image changes of follow-up CT were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: All 187 patients' nucleic acid test were positive to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The early CT images of lung in 187 cases (100%) showed multiple patchy and ground-glass opacities with fine mesh and consolidation shade, which mainly distributed in pulmonary band or under the pleura. In the progressive stage, the pulmonary lesions in 146 cases (78.1%) were mainly consolidation, accompanied by air bronchogram, thickening of blood vessels, and interstitial changes. Severe pulmonary CT images in 15 cases (8%) showed diffuse lesions in both lungs, displaying consolidation, or ""white lung"". The CT imaging features in 185 cases (98.9%) at the absorptive period showed that the lesions diminished and fibrogenesis. The imaging features of 6 times of lung CT examination in one case showed continuous progress. The original lesion in one case was obviously absorbed, but new lesions appeared under the pleura of both lungs at the third review of CT scanning. The changes of CT imaging lesions during follow-up were significantly different in different clinical symptoms improvement time (P< 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Images of COVID-19 in various stages have special characteristics. The change of clinical symptoms is synchronous with the change of reexamination CT. Follow-up CT can reflect the trend of clinical changes. Repeat CT examination plays an important role in the early clinical diagnosis and the evaluation for the therapeutic effect on COVID-19 patient.","Zhong, Zheng; Hu, Ying; Yu, Qizhi; Li, Yuxin; Li, Peng; Huang, Wei; Liu, Jingui; Liu, Jun; Xie, Xingzhi; Zhao, Wei",Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,817,32

Consequently, decisions about how to address issues of trustworthiness and future research goals are often left to the interested researcher. In this paper, we present the first quantitative approach to characterize the comprehension of TwML research. We build a co-occurrence network of words using a web-scraped corpus of more than 7,000 peer-reviewed recent ML papers -- consisting of papers both related and unrelated to TwML. We use community detection to obtain semantic clusters of words in this network that can infer relative positions of TwML topics. We propose an innovative fingerprinting algorithm to obtain probabilistic similarity scores for individual words, then combine them to give a paper-level relevance score. The outcomes of our analysis inform a number of interesting insights on advancing the field of TwML research.","Derzsy, Noemi; Majumdar, Subhabrata; Malik, Rajat",,817,23

At least 30 genes related to 46,XY DSD have been found. However, the clinical phenotypes of patients with different gene mutations overlap, and accurate diagnosis relies on gene sequencing technology. Therefore, this study aims to determine the prevalence of pathogenic mutations in a Chinese cohort with 46,XY DSD by the targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Eighty-seven 46,XY DSD patients were enrolled from the Peking Union Medical College Hospital (Beijing, China). A total of fifty-four rare variants were identified in 60 patients with 46,XY DSD. The incidence of these rare variants was approximately 69.0% (60/87). Twenty-five novel variants and 29 reported variants were identified. Based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, thirty-three variants were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants and 21 variants were assessed as variants of uncertain significance. The overall diagnostic rate was about 42.5% based on the pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants. Androgen receptor (AR), steroid 5-alpha-reductase 2 (SRD5A2) and nuclear receptor subfamily 5 Group A member 1 (NR5A1) gene variants were identified in 21, 13 and 13 patients, respectively. The incidence of these three gene variants was about 78.3% (47/60) in patients with rare variants.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to report the maternal characteristics and clinical outcomes of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective, single-center study includes all consecutive pregnant women with confirmed (laboratory-confirmed) or suspected (according to the Chinese management guideline [version 7.0]) coronavirus disease 2019, regardless of gestational age at diagnosis, admitted to the Strasbourg University Hospital (France) from March 1, 2020, to April 3, 2020. Maternal characteristics, laboratory and imaging findings, and maternal and neonatal outcomes were extracted from medical records. RESULTS: The study includes 54 pregnant women with confirmed (n=38) and suspected (n=16) coronavirus disease 2019. Of these, 32 had an ongoing pregnancy, 1 had a miscarriage, and 21 had live births: 12 vaginal and 9 cesarean deliveries. Among the women who gave birth, preterm deliveries were medically indicated for their coronavirus disease 2019-related condition for 5 of 21 women (23.8%): 3 (14.3%) before 32 weeks' gestation and 2 (9.5%) before 28 weeks' gestation. Oxygen support was required for 13 of 54 women (24.1%), including high-flow oxygen (n=2), noninvasive (n=1) and invasive (n=3) mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n=1). Of these, 3, aged 35 years or older with positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, had respiratory failure requiring indicated delivery before 29 weeks' gestation. All 3 women were overweight or obese, and 2 had an additional comorbidity. CONCLUSION: Coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy was associated with maternal morbidity and preterm birth. Its association with other well-known risk factors for severe maternal morbidity in pregnant women with no infection, including maternal age above 35 years, overweight, and obesity, suggests further studies are required to determine whether these risk factors are also associated with poorer maternal outcome in these women.","Sentilhes, Loïc; De Marcillac, Fanny; Jouffrieau, Charlotte; Kuhn, Pierre; Thuet, Vincent; Hansmann, Yves; Ruch, Yvon; Fafi-Kremer, Samira; Deruelle, Philippe",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,817,1

The primary target cells of coronaviruses compromise the respiratory and gastrointestinal region epithelial cells due to their cell features and delivery through fomites, airborne, or fecal-oral routes. Some functional food sources due to having crucial chemical compounds may help individuals to overcome this infection by modulating the body's immune system, generating antiviral activity against the infection, and reducing other respiratory problems. The purpose of this study was to review these coronaviruses, especially SARS (because of its very similar gene sequence to the 2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2), from the perspective of appropriate approaches to food production technology, including following good food safety practices in food production lines; avoidance of underheating in the processing of swine and the other meat products; uncertainty about the safety of frozen or refrigerated meat products; providing unfavorable environmental conditions for coronavirus survival (minimum heat treatment, e.g., low-temperature long time and greater for liquid food products, pH &#8804; 3, minimum storage relative humidity); production of industrial foods fortified and enriched with vitamin D, C, B3, K, amino acid L-tryptophan, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), and tannins; and preventing the production of industrial foods fortified or enriched with mineral supplements that participate in the Fenton reaction in the human body.

COVID-19 has gained significant attention due to its high prevalence among individuals with diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and metabolic syndrome. NAFLD is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and can be associated with a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The association of COVID-19 and NAFLD has also gained more attention because NAFLD is highly associated with the epidemic of obesity. NAFLD is a potential risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19, independent of metabolic syndrome. Importantly, it is not yet clear whether the epidemics of obesity and NAFLD have perpetuated the current pandemic of COVID-19. Further research is urgently needed to assess the following: (1) Whether NAFLD is a high risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection;(2) Whether NAFLD is associated with the severe form of COVID-19;and (3) Whether the presence of NAFLD can explain the racial variation in the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19.

To activate appropriate safety procedures, pilots need accurate and timely information on the actual runway surface conditions. In this study, XGBoost is used to create a combined runway assessment system, which includes a classifcation model to predict slippery conditions and a regression model to predict the level of slipperiness. The models are trained on weather data and data from runway reports. The runway surface conditions are represented by the tire-pavement friction coefficient, which is estimated from flight sensor data from landing aircrafts. To evaluate the performance of the models, they are compared to several state-of-the-art runway assessment methods. The XGBoost models identify slippery runway conditions with a ROC AUC of 0.95, predict the friction coefficient with a MAE of 0.0254, and outperforms all the previous methods. The results show the strong abilities of machine learning methods to model complex, physical phenomena with a good accuracy when domain knowledge is used in the variable extraction. The XGBoost models are combined with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) approximations to provide a comprehensible decision support system for airport operators and pilots, which can contribute to safer and more economic operations of airport runways.","Midtfjord, Alise Danielle; Bin, Riccardo De; Huseby, Arne Bang",,817,23

METHOD: Retrospective observational study of all patients admitted for COVID-19 and bacterial/fungal infections at the Hospital Clínico Universitario of Valladolid, Spain (March 1-May 31, 2020). Demographic, clinical and microbiological data were compared based on Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission and predictors of mortality by were identified using multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of the 712 COVID-19 patients, 113 (16%) presented bacterial/fungal coinfections or superinfections. Their median age was 73 years (IQR 57-89) and 59% were men. The profiles of ICU patients (44%) included male, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, leukocytosis, elevated inteleukin-6, with interferon ß-1b and tocilizumab and superinfection (p < 0.05). Coinfections were diagnosed in 5% (39/712) patients. Most common pathogens of respiratory coinfection (18) were Streptococcus pneumoniae (6) and Staphylococcus aureus (6). Superinfections were detected in 11% (80/712) patients. Urinary (53) and RIs (39) constituted the majority of superinfections Acinetobacter baumannii multidrug-resistant was the main agent of IR and bacteremia. An outbreak of A. baumannii contributed to this result. Three patients were considered to have probable pulmonary aspergillosis. Mortality was higher in UCI patients (50 vs. 29%; p = 0.028). The predictive factors of mortality included being a male with various comorbidities, SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, bacteremia and superinfections from A. baumannii.

Employing a more realistic model that considers heterogeneous contact is consequently necessary. Here, we use a contact network to reconstruct unprotected, protected contact, and airborne spread to simulate the two-stages outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) on the ""Diamond Princess"" cruise ship. We employ Bayesian inference and Metropolis-Hastings sampling to estimate the model parameters and quantify the uncertainties by the ensemble simulation technique. During the early epidemic with intensive social contacts, the results reveal that the average transmissibility t was 0.026 and the basic reproductive number R 0 was 6.94, triple that in the WHO report, indicating that all people would be infected in one month. The t and R 0 decreased to 0.0007 and 0.2 when quarantine was implemented. The reconstruction suggests that diluting the airborne virus concentration in closed settings is useful in addition to isolation, and high-risk susceptible should follow rigorous prevention measures in case exposed. This study can provide useful implications for control and prevention measures for the other cruise ships and closed settings.","Liu, Feng; Li, Xin; Zhu, Gaofeng",,817,16

We also describe the laboratory capacity building for these diagnostics. METHODS: Laboratory registry data for altogether 80,791 specimens from 70,517 individuals was analysed. The data included the date of sampling, sex, age and the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result on specimens collected between 1 February and 15 June 2020. RESULTS: Altogether, 4057/80,791 (5.0%) of the specimens were positive and 3915/70,517 (5.6%) of the individuals were found positive. In all, 37% of specimens were from male and 67% from female subjects. While the number of positive cases was similar in male and female subjects, the positivity rate was significantly higher in male subjects: 7.5% of male and 4.4% of female subjects tested positive. The highest incidence/100,000 was observed in those aged &#8805;80 years. The proportion of young adults in positive cases increased in late May 2020. Large dips in testing frequency were observed during every weekend and also during public holidays. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that men pursue SARS-CoV-2 testing less frequently than women. Consequently, a subset of coronavirus disease-2019 infections in men may have gone undetected. People sought testing less frequently on weekends and public holidays, and this may also lead to missing of positive cases. The proportion of young adults in positive cases increased towards the end of the study period, which may suggest their returning back to social behaviour with an increased risk of infection.","Jarva, H; Lappalainen, M; Luomala, O; Jokela, P; Jääskeläinen, A E; Jääskeläinen, A J; Kallio-Kokko, H; Kekäläinen, E; Mannonen, L; Soini, H; Suuronen, S; Toivonen, A; Savolainen-Kopra, C; Loginov, R; Kurkela, S",Int J Infect Dis,817,16

It is urgent to distinguish COVID-19 from common pneumonia. In this study, we reported multiple clinical feature analyses on COVID-19 in Inner Mongolia for the first time. We dynamically monitored multiple clinical features of all 75 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 219 pneumonia patients, and 68 matched healthy people in Inner Mongolia. Then, we studied the association between COVID-19 and clinical characteristics, based on which to construct a novel logistic regression model for predicting COVID-19. As a result, among the tested clinical characteristics, WBC, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein (CRP), ALT, and Cr were significantly different between COVID-19 patients and patients in other groups. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.869 for the logistic regression model using multiple factors associated with COVID-19. Furthermore, the CRP reaction showed five different time-series patterns with one-peak and double-peak modes.

However, the role of chest CT in management of COVID-19 patients is not exactly the same for medical or surgical specialties. In orthopaedic or trauma emergency, abdomen, pelvis, cervical, dorsal, and lumbar spine CT are performed to investigate patients; the result is a thoracic CT scan incorporating usually the thorax; however, information about lung parenchyma can be obtained on this thorax CT, and manifestations of COVID-19 can be diagnosed. The objective of our study was to evaluate this role in orthopedic patients to familiarize orthopaedists with the value and limits of thoracic CT in orthopaedic surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among the 1397 chest CT scans performed during the pandemic period from 1 March 2020 to 10 May 2020, in two centres with orthopaedic surgery, we selected all the 118 thoracic or chest CT performed for patients who presented to the Emergency Department of the hospital with a diagnosis of trauma for orthopaedic surgical treatment. Thirty-nine of these 118 patients were tested with PCR for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Depending on clinical status (symptomatic or non-symptomatic), the information useful for the orthopaedist surgeon and obtained from the Chest CT scan according to the result of the PCR (gold standard) was graded from 0 (no or low value) to 3 (high value). The potential risks of chest CT as exposure to radiation, and specific pathway were analyzed and discussed. A group of patients treated during a previous similar period (1 March 2018 to 15 April 2018) was used as control for evaluation of the increase of CT scanning during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Among the 118 patients with chest CT, there were 16 patients with positive COVID-19 chest CT findings, and 102 patients with negative chest CT scan. With PCR results as reference, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value of chest CT in indicating COVID-19 infection were 81%, 93%, and 86%, respectively (p = 0.001). A useful information for the orthopaedic surgeon (graded as 1 for 71 cases, as 2 for 5 cases, and as 3 for 11 cases) was obtained from 118 chest CT scans for 87 (74%) patients, while the CT was no value in 30 (25%) cases, and negative value in one (1%) case. Roughly 20% of the total number of CT scanner performed over the pandemic period was dedicated to COVID-19, but only 2% were for orthopaedic or trauma patients. However, this was ten times higher than during the previous control period of comparison. CONCLUSION: Although extremely valuable for surgery management, these results should not be overstated. The CT findings studied are not specific for COVID-19, and the positive predictive value of CT will be low unless disease prevalence is high, which was the case during this period.","Hernigou, Jacques; Cornil, François; Poignard, Alexandre; El Bouchaibi, Said; Mani, Jean; Naouri, Jean François; Younes, Patrick; Hernigou, Philippe",Int Orthop,817,29

However, rigorous efficacy testing requires extensive screening with live virus under onerous biosafety level 3 (BSL3) conditions, which limits high-throughput screening of patient and vaccine sera. Myriad BSL2-compatible surrogate virus neutralization assays (VNAs) have been developed to overcome this barrier. Yet, there is marked variability between VNAs and how their results are presented, making intergroup comparisons difficult. To address these limitations, we developed a standardized VNA using CoV2-S pseudotyped particles (CoV2pp) based on vesicular stomatitis virus bearing the Renilla luciferase gene in place of its G glycoprotein (VSV&#916;G); this assay can be robustly produced at scale and generate accurate neutralizing titers within 18 h postinfection. Our standardized CoV2pp VNA showed a strong positive correlation with CoV2-S enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results and live-virus neutralizations in confirmed convalescent-patient sera. Three independent groups subsequently validated our standardized CoV2pp VNA (n > 120). Our data (i) show that absolute 50% inhibitory concentration (absIC50), absIC80, and absIC90 values can be legitimately compared across diverse cohorts, (ii) highlight the substantial but consistent variability in neutralization potency across these cohorts, and (iii) support the use of the absIC80 as a more meaningful metric for assessing the neutralization potency of a vaccine or convalescent-phase sera. Lastly, we used our CoV2pp in a screen to identify ultrapermissive 293T clones that stably express ACE2 or ACE2 plus TMPRSS2. When these are used in combination with our CoV2pp, we can produce CoV2pp sufficient for 150,000 standardized VNAs/week.IMPORTANCE Vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics like convalescent-phase plasma therapy are premised upon inducing or transferring neutralizing antibodies that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. Virus neutralization assays (VNAs) for measuring neutralizing antibody titers (NATs) are an essential part of determining vaccine or therapeutic efficacy. However, such efficacy testing is limited by the inherent dangers of working with the live virus, which requires specialized high-level biocontainment facilities. We therefore developed a standardized replication-defective pseudotyped particle system that mimics the entry of live SARS-CoV-2. This tool allows for the safe and efficient measurement of NATs, determination of other forms of entry inhibition, and thorough investigation of virus entry mechanisms. Four independent labs across the globe validated our standardized VNA using diverse cohorts. We argue that a standardized and scalable assay is necessary for meaningful comparisons of the myriad of vaccines and antibody-based therapeutics becoming available. Our data provide generalizable metrics for assessing their efficacy.","Oguntuyo, Kasopefoluwa Y; Stevens, Christian S; Hung, Chuan Tien; Ikegame, Satoshi; Acklin, Joshua A; Kowdle, Shreyas S; Carmichael, Jillian C; Chiu, Hsin-Ping; Azarm, Kristopher D; Haas, Griffin D; Amanat, Fatima; Klingler, Jéromine; Baine, Ian; Arinsburg, Suzanne; Bandres, Juan C; Siddiquey, Mohammed N A; Schilke, Robert M; Woolard, Matthew D; Zhang, Hongbo; Duty, Andrew J; Kraus, Thomas A; Moran, Thomas M; Tortorella, Domenico; Lim, Jean K; Gamarnik, Andrea V; Hioe, Catarina E; Zolla-Pazner, Susan; Ivanov, Stanimir S; Kamil, Jeremy P; Krammer, Florian; Lee, Benhur",mBio (Online),817,1

Reduced glutathione canceled the formation of conjugate and the inhibitory effect of epigallocatechin gallate or myricetin on the enzyme, suggesting that the formation of the quinone moiety in the phytochemicals is critical for the inhibition. The covalent binding of epigallocatechin gallate or myricetin to the cysteine residue at the active site was confirmed by analyzing peptides from the chymotrypsin-digested main protease.","Yoji, Kato Akari Higashiyama Emi Takaoka Miyu Nishikawa Shinichi Ikushiro",,817,24

This has led to the re-organization of the specialty services for the effective utilization of available resources and ensuring the safety of patients and healthcare workers. Suspension of oncology services will have major implications on cancer care due to delayed diagnosis and treatment leading to irreversible adverse consequences. Therefore various oncology organizations have called for a continuation of cancer care during this crisis with diligence. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the clinicians to transform the components of care from screening to outpatient care and primary management. The purpose of this article is to establish guidelines and recommendations for ocular oncology in the management of ocular tumors set by a multidisciplinary team of experts including ocular, medical and radiation oncologists, and pathologists. As the pandemic is evolving fast, it will require constant updates and reformation of health strategies and guidelines for safe and quality health care.","Manjandavida, Fairooz P; Honavar, Santosh G; Kim, Usha; Singh, Usha; Menon, Vikas; Das, Sima; Kaliki, Swathi; Palanivelu, Mahesh Shanmugam; Khetan, Vikas; Shah, Parag K; Rishi, Pukhraj; Mulay, Kaustubh; Gandhi, Arpan; Vadhiraja, B M; Reddy, Vijay Anand; Bhat, Sunil; Rao, Vasudha",Indian J Ophthalmol,817,20

It possesses great capability for post‐translation modification in expression of foreign proteins. With the counterselection cassette rpsL‐neo and phage λ‐Red recombinase, the defective‐rescue BmNPV BES reBmBac can be employed for efficient heterologous multigene coexpression at different gene sites in one baculovirus genome. In the present study, a recombinant baculovirus, reBm‐Cαγ, carrying two types of chicken interferon (IFN) genes (chIFN‐α and chIFN‐γ) was constructed using the reBmBac system. The chIFN‐α and chIFN‐γ genes were inserted into the same baculovirus genome at the polyhedron and p10 gene sites, respectively. The recombinant baculovirus was capable of coexpressing both chIFN‐α and chIFN‐γ. The expression levels of the two types of IFN in the coexpression product were exponentially high, at approximately 1.7 and 2.5 times higher, respectively, than those in the corresponding single‐expression products. The increase in expression level corresponds to replacement of the nonessential p10 gene in the reBm‐Cαγ recombinant baculovirus. This coexpression of recombinant chicken IFNs showed superior antiviral activity.","Liu, Xingjian; Yang, Xin; Mehboob, Arslan; Hu, Xiaoyuan; Yi, Yongzhu; Li, Yinü; Zhang, Zhifang",Microbiologyopen,817,16

This subgroup has higher morbidity and mortality than younger age groups. Superimposed on this, the major preventative intervention resulting in social isolation has negative consequences. Prof. Bernard Isaacs described the “Geriatric Giant Symptoms” in 1965 and encouraged the development of interventions for immobility, instability, incontinence and impaired intellect/memory with careful management of these symptoms resulting in better outcomes for older patients including reduced admissions to Nursing Homes and mortality. The author’s explore the impact of the current pandemic and, most particularly its aftermath on the provision of such interventions. In the context of a major economic crisis, resources for highly effective interventions such as joint replacement surgery, urological interventions, cataract surgery will be all be limited after this crisis. Moreover delayed access to day patient services with suboptimal access to assessments for conditions such as cognitive decline and falls as well as social care will likewise militate against addressing the “Geriatric Giant Symptoms”. Thus the “Founding Fathers” of Geriatric Medicine including Prof Isaacs would be justifiably concerned regarding our ability to deliver interventions to address the “Geriatric Giant Symptoms”. Current leaders in geriatric medicine, healthcare workers, funders and providers as well as advocacy groups must redouble their efforts to ensure gains made in management of older patients over 2 generations are not lost in the aftermath of this pandemic.","Flatharta, Tomás Ó.; Mulkerrin, E.
