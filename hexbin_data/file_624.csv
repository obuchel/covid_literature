Some hospitals have initiated efforts to apply the Kaizen philosophy to improve this situation. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to analyze the methodological impact of Kaizen–Kata implementation in Mexican public hospitals that have tried to solve operational problems using this improvement approach. Design/Methodology/Approach: The service organization implemented Kaizen–Kata methodology in order to improve one operational problem-process in health care. A case-study approach was used in this research in order to understand the effects of the Kaizen–Kata methodology in solving problems in their operational procedures. Findings: Six specific drivers were identified when applying the Kaizen–Kata methodology. Furthermore, the impact on the levels of implementation of the Kaizen–Kata methodology in each of the improvement teams studied was also identified. Research Limitations: The main limitation of the research is that only three case-studies are presented thus it is not possible to generalize its results. Practical Implications (Where Possible): Other public hospitals can use this specific example as a working guide to solve the operational problems of health systems. Originality/Value: A methodology of continuous improvement in manufacturing was imported from the industry sector for application in an operational health care process. The Kaizen–Kata methodology contributed significantly to improving issues involving delays, customer complaints, process reworks and extra-cost, among other effects of operational problems.","Suárez-Barraza, Manuel F.; Miguel-Davila, José A.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,624,18

However, the interaction between them is complex and not entirely clear. This study was performed in postoperative patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) to elucidate the correlation between the systemic cellular immunity function and circulating cytokines levels in the early postoperative period. Twenty-four cases of postoperative patients admitted to the ICU were enrolled in this study. Twelve hours after admission, blood routine examination and measurement of circulating cytokines (interleukin-2 [IL-2], IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α], TNF-β, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor [G-CSF], and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) were performed. The correlation analysis between cytokines levels and absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte count or lymphocytes/neutrophils ratio was analyzed. The cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, TNF-α, G-CSF, and GM-CSF) levels were increased above the normal upper limit at 12 hours after surgery. The number of leukocytes and neutrophils were markedly increased. In contrast, the absolute count and relative ratio of lymphocytes decreased below the lower normal limit. Spearman correlation analysis showed a moderate negative correlation between absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte count and IL-2 or IL-4 level. A low-negative correlation between absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte count and GM-CSF levels was detected. We also found that lymphocytes/neutrophils ratio was also negatively correlated with plasma IL-2, IL-4, or GM-CSF level. In ICU patients with compromised immune function in the early postoperative period, the elevated levels of IL-2, IL-4, and GM-CSF may be the compensatory responses to systemic immunosuppression.","Chen, Xiaoyan; Yuan, Shiying; Zhang, Jiancheng",Medicine (Baltimore),624,18

Due to low sensitivity of this method, early-stage cancers are undetected, lowering the treatment success. In this study, we analyzed extracellular vesicles isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage of lung cancer suspects by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. The protein composition of bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicles of late-stage cancer showed a higher proteome complexity associated with mortality within the two year follow-up period. We identified a potential therapeutic target DNMT3B complex which was significantly expressed in bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicles as well as in tumor tissue. Bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicles proteome analysis of immune markers indicates the presence of markers of innate immune and fibroblast cells. ABSTRACT: Acellular bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) proteomics can partially separate lung cancer from non-lung cancer patients based on principal component analysis and multivariate analysis. Furthermore, the variance in the proteomics data sets is correlated mainly with lung cancer status and, to a lesser extent, smoking status and gender. Despite these advances BAL small and large extracellular vehicles (EVs) proteomes reveal aberrant protein expression in paracrine signaling mechanisms in cancer initiation and progression. We consequently present a case-control study of 24 bronchoalveolar lavage extracellular vesicle samples which were analyzed by state-of-the-art liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We obtained evidence that BAL EVs proteome complexity correlated with lung cancer stage 4 and mortality within two years´ follow-up (p value = 0.006). The potential therapeutic target DNMT3B complex is significantly up-regulated in tumor tissue and BAL EVs. The computational analysis of the immune and fibroblast cell markers in EVs suggests that patients who deceased within the follow-up period display higher marker expression indicative of innate immune and fibroblast cells (four out of five cases). This study provides insights into the proteome content of BAL EVs and their correlation to clinical outcomes.","Carvalho, Ana Sofia; Moraes, Maria Carolina Strano; Hyun Na, Chan; Fierro-Monti, Ivo; Henriques, Andreia; Zahedi, Sara; Bodo, Cristian; Tranfield, Erin M; Sousa, Ana Laura; Farinho, Ana; Rodrigues, Luís Vaz; Pinto, Paula; Bárbara, Cristina; Mota, Leonor; de Abreu, Tiago Tavares; Semedo, Júlio; Seixas, Susana; Kumar, Prashant; Costa-Silva, Bruno; Pandey, Akhilesh; Matthiesen, Rune",Cancers (Basel),624,18

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Co-design workshops with general practitioners were conducted. The workshops focused on (1) understanding the current consultation context and identifying existing problems, (2) ideating future solutions to these problems, and (3) discussing future roles for AI in primary care. The workshop activities included affinity diagramming, brainwriting, and video prototyping methods. The workshops were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Inductive thematic analysis of the transcripts of conversations was performed. RESULTS: Two researchers facilitated 3 co-design workshops with 16 general practitioners. Three main themes emerged: professional autonomy, human-AI collaboration, and new models of care. Major implications identified within these themes included (1) concerns with medico-legal aspects arising from constant recording and accessibility of full consultation records, (2) future consultations taking place out of the exam rooms in a distributed system involving empowered patients, (3) human conversation and empathy remaining the core tasks of doctors in any future AI-enabled consultations, and (4) questioning the current focus of AI initiatives on improved efficiency as opposed to patient care. CONCLUSIONS: AI documentation assistants will likely to be integral to the future primary care consultations. However, these technologies will still need to be supervised by a human until strong evidence for reliable autonomous performance is available. Therefore, different human-AI collaboration models will need to be designed and evaluated to ensure patient safety, quality of care, doctor safety, and doctor autonomy.","Kocaballi, A Baki; Ijaz, Kiran; Laranjo, Liliana; Quiroz, Juan C; Rezazadegan, Dana; Tong, Huong Ly; Willcock, Simon; Berkovsky, Shlomo; Coiera, Enrico",J Am Med Inform Assoc,624,18

A more accurate assessment of the security provision informs on the most vulnerable environments that necessitate more diligent management. The rapid proliferation in the automation of cyber-attacks is reducing the gap between information and operational technologies and the need to review the current levels of robustness against new sophisticated cyber-attacks, trends, technologies and mitigation countermeasures has become pressing. A deeper characterisation is also the basis with which to predict future vulnerabilities in turn guiding the most appropriate deployment technologies. Thus, refreshing established practices and the scope of the training to support the decision making of users and operators. The foundation of the training provision is the use of Cyber-Ranges (CRs) and Test-Beds (TBs), platforms/tools that help inculcate a deeper understanding of the evolution of an attack and the methodology to deploy the most impactful countermeasures to arrest breaches. In this paper, an evaluation of documented CRs and TBs platforms is evaluated. CRs and TBs are segmented by type, technology, threat scenarios, applications and the scope of attainable training. To enrich the analysis of documented CRs and TBs research and cap the study, a taxonomy is developed to provide a broader comprehension of the future of CRs and TBs. The taxonomy elaborates on the CRs/TBs dimensions, as well as, highlighting a diminishing differentiation between application areas.","Ukwandu, Elochukwu; Farah, Mohamed Amine Ben; Hindy, Hanan; Brosset, David; Kavallieros, Dimitris; Atkinson, Robert; Tachtatzis, Christos; Bures, Miroslav; Andonovic, Ivan; Bellekens, Xavier",Sensors (Basel),624,18

We carried out a systematic review of literature based on structured search in the MEDLINE/PubMed, SCOPUS and CINAHL databases, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, to estimate the prevalence of diabetes and hypertension among Hajj pilgrims. Twenty-six studies conducted between 1993 and 2018 with a total of 285,467 participants were included in the review. The weighted pooled prevalence rates of hypertension and diabetes among Hajj pilgrims in all included studies were 12.2% (95% CI: 12.0–12.3) and 5.0% (95% CI: 4.9–5.1), respectively. The reported prevalence of other underlying health conditions such as chronic respiratory, kidney or liver disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer and immune deficiency were generally low. Potentially a large number of pilgrims each Hajj have diabetes and/or hypertension and other underlying health conditions.

Substantial evidence has indicated that community pharmacists (CPs) can play a critical role in managing the ever-increasing threat of antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitude, and practices of CPs (n = 180) towards antibiotics and antibiotic resistance as well as to improve the rational use of antibiotics. A two-phase mixed-methods (quantitative and qualitative) online study was conducted in Pakistan from August 2019 to March 2020 by using validated questionnaires and semi-structured interview data. Different statistical methods were used to tabulate the quantitative data, whereas inductive thematic analysis was conducted to categorize themes from the qualitative data and to draw conclusions. Approximately 64.4% of the CPs were male (mean: 29–33 years old). Overall, CPs had good knowledge of and were familiar with multidrug-resistant organisms and their roles in ABR (65.6%, median = 1, and IQR = 1), although their knowledge was poor in differentiating some antibiotic groups with their respective ABR patterns (31.1%, median = 1, and IQR = 1). Most CPs have a positive attitude towards antibiotics, with most (90.0%) identifying ABR as a critical issue in public health (median = 1 and IQR = 0). Overall, CPs’ practices towards antibiotics were somewhat acceptable, where they leaned towards educating patients about the rational use of antibiotics (52.8%, median = 1, and IQR = 1). The two main themes discovered (antibiotics and counseling of patients) were related to self-medication, while educational intervention is the main subtheme. ABR is multifactorial, with subthemes related to budget, time constraints, incompetent staff, the absence of CPs, the lack of training, and the enforcement of laws and regulations being the needs of the hour in Pakistan. Effective antibiotic stewardship programs, patient education, and awareness campaigns about antibiotics and ABR along with training of the CPs are important factors that have to be addressed in a timely manner.","Khan, Faiz Ullah; Khan, Farman Ullah; Hayat, Khezar; Ahmad, Tawseef; Khan, Amjad; Chang, Jie; Malik, Usman Rashid; Khan, Zakir; Lambojon, Krizzia; Fang, Yu",Int J Environ Res Public Health,624,18

This study aimed to investigate the effects of the specific PKR inhibitor C16 (C13H8N4OS) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced AKI, and its mechanisms of action. MATERIAL/METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were injected intraperitoneally with C16 or vehicle 1 h before the LPS challenge and then injected intraperitoneally with LPS or 0.9% saline. After the LPS challenge, histopathological damage, renal function, and levels of proinflammatory cytokines were assessed. All the related signaling pathways were analyzed. RESULTS: C16 effectively inhibited LPS-induced renal elevation of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. C16 prevented NF-κB activation and suppressed the PKR/eIF2α signaling pathway in AKI after the LPS challenge. Furthermore, C16 significantly inhibited pyroptosis during AKI, as evidenced by decreased renal levels of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein; NACHT, LRR, NLR Family Pyrin Domain-Containing 3; caspase-1; interleukin (IL)-1β; and IL-18. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that inhibition by C16 ameliorated LPS-induced renal inflammation and injury, at least partly through modulation of the pyroptosis signal pathway in the kidney.","Zhou, Jialu; Zhang, Fan; Lin, Hongru; Quan, Minxue; Yang, Yaqin; Lv, Yanni; He, Zongnan; Qian, Yisong",Med Sci Monit,624,18

This study aimed to investigate the utilization of RT for osteosarcomas in the recent 20 years and to identify factors related to patients’ response to radiation. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients irradiated for osteosarcoma treatment. We planned to assess differences in the utilization of RT between the periods of 2000–2010 and 2011–2020, identify the risk factors associated with local progression (LP), determine whether RT-related parameters are associated with LP, and calculate patients’ survival. Results: A total of 126 patients with osteosarcoma who received 181 RT treatments were identified. We found a difference in RT techniques between RT performed in the years 2000–2010 and that performed in the years 2011–2020. LP was observed after 37 (20.4%) RT treatments. Intent of RT, distant metastases, and concomitant systemic treatment affected the risk of LP. Five-year overall survival was 33% (95% confidence interval (26%–43%)). Conclusions: RT for osteosarcoma treatment has evolved from simple two-dimensional palliative irradiation into more conformal RT applied for new indications including oligometastatic and oligoprogressive disease.

Alpha-tocopherol, the most biologically active form of vitamin E, declines in blood and reaches the lowest levels (hypovitaminosis E) around calving. Hypovitaminosis E is associated with the incidence of peripartum diseases. Therefore, many studies which have been published for more than 30 years have investigated the effects of α-tocopherol supplementation. This α-tocopherol deficiency was thought to be caused by complex factors. However, until recently, the physiological factors or pathways underlying hypovitaminosis E in the transition period have been poorly understood. In the last 10 years, the α-tocopherol-related genes expression, which regulate the metabolism, transportation, and tissue distribution of α-tocopherol in humans and rodents, has been reported in ruminant tissues. In this paper, we discuss at least six physiological phenomena that occur during the transition period and may be candidate factors predisposing to a decreased blood α-tocopherol level and hypovitaminosis E with changes in α-tocopherol-related genes expression. ABSTRACT: Levels of alpha-tocopherol (α-Toc) decline gradually in blood throughout prepartum, reaching lowest levels (hypovitaminosis E) around calving. Despite numerous reports about the disease risk in hypovitaminosis E and the effect of α-Toc supplementation on the health of transition dairy cows, its risk and supplemental effects are controversial. Here, we present some novel data about the disease risk of hypovitaminosis E and the effects of α-Toc supplementation in transition dairy cows. These data strongly demonstrate that hypovitaminosis E is a risk factor for the occurrence of peripartum disease. Furthermore, a study on the effectiveness of using serum vitamin levels as biomarkers to predict disease in dairy cows was reported, and a rapid field test for measuring vitamin levels was developed. By contrast, evidence for how hypovitaminosis E occurred during the transition period was scarce until the 2010s. Pioneering studies conducted with humans and rodents have identified and characterised some α-Toc-related proteins, molecular players involved in α-Toc regulation followed by a study in ruminants from the 2010s. Based on recent literature, the six physiological factors: (1) the decline in α-Toc intake from the close-up period; (2) changes in the digestive and absorptive functions of α-Toc; (3) the decline in plasma high-density lipoprotein as an α-Toc carrier; (4) increasing oxidative stress and consumption of α-Toc; (5) decreasing hepatic α-Toc transfer to circulation; and (6) increasing mammary α-Toc transfer from blood to colostrum, may be involved in α-Toc deficiency during the transition period. However, the mechanisms and pathways are poorly understood, and further studies are needed to understand the physiological role of α-Toc-related molecules in cattle. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying hypovitaminosis E will contribute to the prevention of peripartum disease and high performance in dairy cows.","Haga, Satoshi; Ishizaki, Hiroshi; Roh, Sanggun",Animals (Basel),624,18

Although the organization of the dolphin TRB locus is similar to that of the other artiodactyl species, with three in tandem D-J-C clusters located at its 3′ end, its uniqueness is given by the reduction of the total length due essentially to the absence of duplications and to the deletions that have drastically reduced the number of the germline TRBV genes. We have analyzed the relevant mature transcripts from two subjects. The simultaneous availability of rearranged T cell receptor α (TRA) and TRB cDNA from the peripheral blood of one of the two specimens, and the human/dolphin amino acids multi-sequence alignments, allowed us to calculate the most likely interactions at the protein interface between the alpha/beta heterodimer in complex with major histocompatibility class I (MH1) protein. Interacting amino acids located in the complementarity-determining region according to IMGT numbering (CDR-IMGT) of the dolphin variable V-alpha and beta domains were identified.

While being stable barriers that delimitate the cell as the fundamental organismal unit, biological membranes are highly dynamic by allowing for lateral diffusion, transbilayer passage via selective channels, and in eukaryotic cells for endocytic uptake through the formation of membrane bound vesicular or tubular carriers. Two of the most abundant fundamental fabrics of membranes—lipids and complex sugars—are produced through elaborate chains of biosynthetic enzymes, which makes it difficult to study them by conventional reverse genetics. This review illustrates how organic synthesis provides access to uncharted areas of membrane glycobiology research and its application to biomedicine. For this Special Issue on Chemical Biology Research in France, focus will be placed on synthetic approaches (i) to study endocytic functions of glycosylated proteins and lipids according to the GlycoLipid–Lectin (GL–Lect) hypothesis, notably that of Shiga toxin; (ii) to mechanistically dissect its endocytosis and intracellular trafficking with small molecule; and (iii) to devise intracellular delivery strategies for immunotherapy and tumor targeting. It will be pointed out how the chemical biologist’s view on lipids, sugars, and proteins synergizes with biophysics and modeling to “look” into the membrane for atomistic scale insights on molecular rearrangements that drive the biogenesis of endocytic carriers in processes of clathrin-independent endocytosis.","Johannes, Ludger",Molecules,624,18

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a brief slow-paced breathing (SPB) exercise on psychophysiological variables linked to emotion regulation, namely cardiac vagal activity (CVA), as well as perceived stress intensity, emotional arousal, and emotional valence. A total of 61 participants completed a 5-min SPB exercise and a control condition of a 5-min rest measurement. CVA was indexed with the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD). Participants were also asked to rate their perceived stress intensity, emotional arousal, and emotional valence. Results showed that CVA was higher during SPB in comparison to the control condition. Contrary to our hypothesis, perceived stress intensity and emotional arousal increased after SPB, and perceived emotional valence was less positive after SPB. This could be explained by experiencing dyspnea (i.e., breathing discomfort), and the need to get acclimatized to SPB. Consequently, we may conclude that although physiological benefits of SPB on CVA are immediate, training may be required in order to perceive psychological benefits.","You, Min; Laborde, Sylvain; Zammit, Nina; Iskra, Maša; Borges, Uirassu; Dosseville, Fabrice; Vaughan, Robert S.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,624,18

This review will briefly summarize the components of cannabis and the endocannabinoid system, as well as the cellular and molecular mechanisms of biological cannabis action in human cells and biologic activities on tissues. We will also look into oropharyngeal tissue expression of cannabinoid receptors, together with a putative association of cannabis to several oral diseases. Therefore, this review will elaborate the basic biology and physiology of cannabinoids in human oral tissues with the aim of providing a better comprehension of the effects of its use and abuse on oral health, in order to include cannabinoid usage into dental patient health records as well as good medicinal practice. Methods: the paper selection was performed by PubMed/Medline and EMBASE electronic databases, and reported according to the PRISMA guidelines. The scientific products were included for qualitative analysis. Results: the paper search screened a total of 276 papers. After the initial screening and the eligibility assessment, a total of 32 articles were considered for the qualitative analysis. Conclusions: today, cannabis consumption has been correlated to a higher risk of gingival and periodontal disease, oral infection and cancer of the oral cavity, while the physico-chemical activity has not been completely clarified. Further investigations are necessary to evaluate a therapeutic efficacy of this class of drugs for the promising treatment of several different diseases of the salivary glands and oral diseases.","Bellocchio, Luigi; Inchingolo, Alessio Danilo; Inchingolo, Angelo Michele; Lorusso, Felice; Malcangi, Giuseppina; Santacroce, Luigi; Scarano, Antonio; Bordea, Ioana Roxana; Hazballa, Denisa; D’Oria, Maria Teresa; Isacco, Ciro Gargiulo; Nucci, Ludovica; Serpico, Rosario; Tartaglia, Gianluca Martino; Giovanniello, Delia; Contaldo, Maria; Farronato, Marco; Dipalma, Gianna; Inchingolo, Francesco",Int J Mol Sci,624,18

The accumulation of these free radicals contributes significantly to aging and several age-related diseases. Angiotensin II can contribute to DNA damage through oxidative stress by activating the NAD(P)H oxidase pathway, which in turn results in the production of reactive oxygen species. This radical oxygen-containing molecule has been linked to aging and several age-related disorders, including renal damage. Considering the role of angiotensin in aging, melatonin might relieve angiotensin-II-induced stress by enhancing the mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 pathway, which is crucial in preventing the mitochondrial calcium overload that may trigger increased production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress.

Overexpression of this kinase is linked with various cancers in humans due to its dual involvement in cell development. Furthermore, emerging evidence has revealed that inhibiting CDK7 has anti-cancer effects, driving the development of novel and more cost-effective inhibitors with enhanced selectivity for CDK7 over other CDKs. In the present investigation, a pharmacophore-based approach was utilized to identify potential hit compounds against CDK7. The generated pharmacophore models were validated and used as 3D queries to screen 55,578 natural drug-like compounds. The obtained compounds were then subjected to molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations to predict their binding mode with CDK7. The molecular dynamics simulation trajectories were subsequently used to calculate binding affinity, revealing four hits—ZINC20392430, SN00112175, SN00004718, and SN00262261—having a better binding affinity towards CDK7 than the reference inhibitors (CT7001 and THZ1). The binding mode analysis displayed hydrogen bond interactions with the hinge region residues Met94 and Glu95, DFG motif residue Asp155, ATP-binding site residues Thr96, Asp97, and Gln141, and quintessential residue outside the kinase domain, Cys312 of CDK7. The in silico selectivity of the hits was further checked by docking with CDK2, the close homolog structure of CDK7. Additionally, the detailed pharmacokinetic properties were predicted, revealing that our hits have better properties than established CDK7 inhibitors CT7001 and THZ1. Hence, we argue that proposed hits may be crucial against CDK7-related malignancies.","Kumar, Vikas; Parate, Shraddha; Thakur, Gunjan; Lee, Gihwan; Ro, Hyeon-Su; Kim, Yongseong; Kim, Hong Ja; Kim, Myeong Ok; Lee, Keun Woo",Biomedicines,624,18

Many age-related disorders have a direct or indirect impact on nutrition, both in terms of nutrient assimilation and food access, which may result in vitamin deficiencies and may lead to or worsen disabilities. Frailty is characterized by reduced functional abilities, with a key role of malnutrition in its pathogenesis. Aging is associated with various changes in body composition that lead to sarcopenia. Frailty, aging, and sarcopenia all favor malnutrition, and poor nutritional status is a major cause of geriatric morbidity and mortality. In the present narrative review, we focused on vitamins with a significant risk of deficiency in high-income countries: D, C, and B (B6/B9/B12). We also focused on vitamin E as the main lipophilic antioxidant, synergistic to vitamin C. We first discuss the role and needs of these vitamins, the prevalence of deficiencies, and their causes and consequences. We then look at how these vitamins are involved in the biological pathways associated with sarcopenia and frailty. Lastly, we discuss the critical early diagnosis and management of these deficiencies and summarize potential ways of screening malnutrition. A focused nutritional approach might improve the diagnosis of nutritional deficiencies and the initiation of appropriate clinical interventions for reducing the risk of frailty. Further comprehensive research programs on nutritional interventions are needed, with a view to lowering deficiencies in older people and thus decreasing the risk of frailty and sarcopenia.","Gana, Wassim; De Luca, Arnaud; Debacq, Camille; Poitau, Fanny; Poupin, Pierre; Aidoud, Amal; Fougère, Bertrand",Nutrients,624,18

Herein, the heterogeneous tumor stroma decisively impacts on tumor progression, therapy resistance, and, thus, poor clinical outcome. Among the numerous non-epithelial cells constructing the complex environment of lung carcinomas, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) gained attraction being stromal precursor cells that could be recruited and ‘educated’ by lung cancer cells to adopt a tumor-associated MSC phenotype, serve as source for activated fibroblasts and presumably for vascular mural cells finally reinforcing tumor progression. Lung-resident MSCs should be considered as ‘local MSCs in stand by’ ready to be arranged within the cancer stroma. ABSTRACT: Lung-resident mesenchymal stem cells (LR-MSCs) are non-hematopoietic multipotent stromal cells that predominately reside adventitial within lung blood vessels. Based on their self-renewal and differentiation properties, LR-MSCs turned out to be important regulators of normal lung homeostasis. LR-MSCs exert beneficial effects mainly by local secretion of various growth factors and cytokines that in turn foster pulmonary regeneration including suppression of inflammation. At the same time, MSCs derived from various tissues of origins represent the first choice of cells for cell-based therapeutic applications in clinical medicine. Particularly for various acute as well as chronic lung diseases, the therapeutic applications of exogenous MSCs were shown to mediate beneficial effects, hereby improving lung function and survival. In contrast, endogenous MSCs of normal lungs seem not to be sufficient for lung tissue protection or repair following a pathological trigger; LR-MSCs could even contribute to initiation and/or progression of lung diseases, particularly lung cancer because of their inherent tropism to migrate towards primary tumors and metastatic sites. However, the role of endogenous LR-MSCs to be multipotent tumor-associated (stromal) precursors remains to be unraveled. Here, we summarize the recent knowledge how ‘cancer-educated’ LR-MSCs impact on lung cancer with a focus on mesenchymal stem cell fates.","Sentek, Hanna; Klein, Diana",Cancers (Basel),624,18

A Cross-Sectional Study,22.802967,4.048023,2021-09-17,"Vaccination remains one of the most successful medical interventions in history, significantly decreasing morbidity and mortality associated with, or even eradicating, numerous infectious diseases. Although traditional immunization strategies have recently proven insufficient in the face of many highly mutable and emerging pathogens, modern strategies aim to rationally engineer a single antigen or cocktail of antigens to generate a focused, protective immune response. However, the effect of cocktail vaccination (simultaneous immunization with multiple immunogens) on the antibody response to each individual antigen within the combination, remains largely unstudied. To investigate whether immunization with a cocktail of diverse antigens would result in decreased antibody titer against each unique antigen in the cocktail compared to immunization with each antigen alone, we immunized mice with surface proteins from uropathogenic Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Neisseria meningitides, and monitored the development of antigen-specific IgG antibody responses. We found that antigen-specific endpoint antibody titers were comparable across immunization groups by study conclusion (day 70). Further, we discovered that although cocktail-immunized mice initially elicited more robust antibody responses, the rate of titer development decreases significantly over time compared to single antigen-immunized mice. Investigating the basic properties that govern the development of antigen-specific antibody responses will help inform the design of future combination immunization regimens.","Pilewski, Kelsey A.; Kramer, Kevin J.; Georgiev, Ivelin S.",Vaccines (Basel),624,18

Patients face new challenges: They are a cost factor, which has to be monitored. This requires access to all their health care data plus additional information. Patients’ behavior may well be measured in the future—mandatory genetic testing could be on the horizon, and in times of coronavirus the question of compulsory vaccinations arises once again. There is more: Should every German citizen automatically become an organ donor by law? Should opting out mean having to make a written declaration? And should the system punish people who opt out, e.g. by putting them last on the waiting list if they need an organ transplant? Is this environment really conducive to creating high acceptance of digitalization from the patients’ point of view? We conducted the following three studies, which will help to understand patients’ needs and perspectives in the age of digitalization in health care, especially in the hospital environment. Ultimately, patients’ acceptance of innovation and digitalization is crucial to the success of implementing new technologies in health care. To achieve higher acceptance, policymakers should promote public campaigns to communicate the advantages of these technologies for all patients in the health care system.","Plugmann, Julia; Plugmann, Philipp",Digitalization in Healthcare,624,1

Our protocols rely on passive implementations of Oblivious Transfer (OT) in the boolean setting and Oblivious Linear function Evaluation (OLE) in the arithmetic setting. Previously, such protocols were only known over sufficiently large fields (Genkin et al. STOC ‘14) or a constant number of parties (Ishai et al. CRYPTO ‘08). Conceptually, our protocols are obtained via a new compiler from a passively-secure protocol for a distributed multiplication functionality [Formula: see text] , to an actively-secure protocol for general functionalities. Roughly, [Formula: see text] is parameterized by a linear-secret sharing scheme [Formula: see text] , where it takes [Formula: see text] -shares of two secrets and returns [Formula: see text] -shares of their product. We show that our compilation is concretely efficient for sufficiently large fields, resulting in an overhead of 2 when securely computing natural circuits. Our compiler has two additional benefits: (1) it can rely on any passive implementation of [Formula: see text] , which, besides the standard implementation based on OT (for boolean) and OLE (for arithmetic) allows us to rely on implementations based on threshold cryptosystems (Cramer et al. Eurocrypt ‘01); and (2) it can rely on weaker-than-passive (i.e., imperfect/leaky) implementations, which in some parameter regimes yield actively-secure protocols with overhead less than 2.

We utilize a combination of news articles and press releases, sheriff’s department Facebook posts, publicly available jail data, courtroom observations, in-depth interviews with those who have been held in rural jails, and interviews with rural law enforcement staff to explore this theme. As elected officials, rural sheriffs are beholden to populations that include many who are suspicious of science, liberal agendas, and anything that might threaten what they see as individual freedom. At the same time, they expect local law enforcement to employ punitive measures to control perceived criminal activity in their communities. These communities are often tightly knit, cohesive, and isolated, with high levels of social support both for community members and local leaders, including sheriffs and law enforcement. This complex social context often puts rural sheriffs and law enforcement officers in difficult positions. Given the multiple cross-pressures that rural justice systems faced in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, we explore the circumstances in which they attempted to protect and advocate for the health and safety of both their incarcerated and their nonincarcerated populations. We find that certain characteristics of rural communities both help and hinder local law enforcement in efforts to combat the virus, but these characteristics typically favor informal norms of social control to govern community health. Thus, rural sheriff’s departments repeatedly chose strategies that limited their abilities to protect populations from the disease, in favor of appearing tough on crime and supportive of personal liberty.","Sherman, Jennifer; Schwartz, Jennifer",Am Behav Sci,624,19

The data set is disaggregated into four major profiles of agile organisations: laggards, execution specialists, experimenters, and leaders. The approach to agile transformation is analysed by each of those profiles. While the positive effect from a more holistic approach is confirmed, leaders tend to focus more on processes and products rather than project work. Respondents perceive that IT, product development and research are most agile functions within their organisations, while human resources, finance and administration are considered being not agile. Furthermore, organisations with higher levels of organisational agility tend to use more than one agile scaling framework.

The initial purpose of this preliminary study was to evaluate the level of knowledge and practice of the lifestyle medicine principles (before, during, and with potential solutions for the after-crisis). Now as the crisis still continues in some parts, what we all might still need to learn and agree on is the importance of nutrition not only in relation to the NCDs, but even in a pandemic such as the present one. METHODS: A simple questionnaire covering major areas in Lifestyle Medicine interventions, was distributed to a group of participants from the general public (diverse in terms of age, education, location), asking to review to their best ability their perception on issues in those areas. The Nutrition section focused mainly on dietary patterns. RESULTS: About 75% of the respondents reported to be “Healthy”, 64% having sedentary jobs, 75% being non-smokers and 58% non-drinkers. Nutrition area showed that: 91% are regularly home cooking, 60% are non-vegetarian, and 90% are using herbs and spices. Onion and Garlic in 80% of cases were the foods most used that offered the much needed protection (only 8% being at a point or another founded positive), and only 35% used supplements. The importance of staying informed, and that of eating more foods that optimize the immunity was recognized as important by 58% respectively 84% of the participants.

Sugar beet pulp, as an agro-industrial residue of microorganism, can be utilized by pretreatment, which is usually a costly process. Pretreatment with organic acids creates a great opportunity to convert the process into more economic and effective.

Leptin activates the secretion of chemical mediators, which contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and psoriasis. Conversely, adiposity and obesity are the major aggravating risk factors in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome (MetS), including type II diabetes mellitus and obesity-associated hypertension. Elevated level of leptin in obesity-associated hypertension causes an increase in the production of aldosterone, which also results in elevation of arterial blood pressure. Hyperleptinemia is associated with the progress of the atherosclerosis through secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-17, and other cytokines to promote inflammation. The release of those cytokines leads to chronic inflammatory disorders and obesity-associated MetS. Thus, the aberrant leptin level in both MetS and chronic inflammatory disorders also leads to the complication of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Therapeutic target of leptin regarding its pro-inflammatory effect and dysregulated sympathetic nervous system activity may prevent further cardiovascular complication. This review mainly assesses the mechanism of leptin on the pathogenesis and further cardiovascular risk complication of chronic inflammatory disorders.","Dessie, Gashaw; Ayelign, Birhanu; Akalu, Yonas; Shibabaw, Tewodros; Molla, Meseret Derbew",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,624,1

Time-controlled adaptive ventilation was compared with volume-controlled ventilation at the same levels of mean airway pressure and positive end-release pressure (time-controlled adaptive ventilation)/positive end-expiratory pressure (volume-controlled ventilation) in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced pneumonia model. DESIGN Animal study. SETTING Laboratory investigation. SUBJECTS Twenty-one Wistar rats. INTERVENTIONS Twenty-four hours after pneumonia induction, Wistar rats (n = 7) were ventilated with time-controlled adaptive ventilation (tidal volume = 8 mL/kg, airway pressure release ventilation for a Thigh = 0.75-0.85 s, release pressure (Plow) set at 0 cm H2O, and generating a positive end-release pressure = 1.6 cm H2O applied for Tlow = 0.11-0.14 s). The expiratory flow was terminated at 75% of the expiratory flow peak. An additional 14 animals were ventilated using volume-controlled ventilation, maintaining similar time-controlled adaptive ventilation levels of positive end-release pressure (positive end-expiratory pressure=1.6 cm H2O) and mean airway pressure = 10 cm H2O. Additional nonventilated animals (n = 7) were used for analysis of molecular biology markers. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS After 1 hour of mechanical ventilation, the heterogeneity score, the expression of pro-inflammatory biomarkers interleukin-6 and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 in lung tissue were significantly lower in the time-controlled adaptive ventilation than volume-controlled ventilation with similar mean airway pressure groups (p = 0.008, p = 0.011, and p = 0.011, respectively). Epithelial cell integrity, measured by E-cadherin tissue expression, was higher in time-controlled adaptive ventilation than volume-controlled ventilation with similar mean airway pressure (p = 0.004). Time-controlled adaptive ventilation animals had bacteremia counts lower than volume-controlled ventilation with similar mean airway pressure animals, while time-controlled adaptive ventilation and volume-controlled ventilation with similar positive end-release pressure animals had similar colony-forming unit counts. In addition, lung edema and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 gene expression were more reduced in time-controlled adaptive ventilation than volume-controlled ventilation with similar positive end-release pressure groups. CONCLUSIONS In the model of pneumonia used herein, at the same tidal volume and mean airway pressure, time-controlled adaptive ventilation, compared with volume-controlled ventilation, was associated with less lung damage and bacteremia and reduced gene expression of mediators associated with inflammation.","de Magalhães, Raquel F; Cruz, Daniela G; Antunes, Mariana A; Fernandes, Marcos V de S; Oliveira, Milena V; Braga, Cassia L; Satalin, Joshua; Andrews, Penny; Habashi, Nader; Nieman, Gary; de-Albuquerque, Cassiano F Gonçalves; Silva, Adriana R; Ribeiro, Roseli V; Capelozzi, Vera L; Cruz, Fernanda F; Samary, Cynthia Dos S; Rocco, Patricia R M; Silva, Pedro L",Critical care medicine,624,1

Indication Laparoscopic supralevatory tumour mobilisation is an established method in selected centres and can be the initial step in approaching sacrococcygeal teratomas with an intrapelvic portion, facilitating a complete (R0) resection. Method Laparoscopic surgery is performed in supine position with a 5 mm umbilical trocar, a 5 mm trocar in the right upper abdomen, and two 3 mm trocars in the left middle and lower abdomen. We use a 5 mm 45° optic and 3 mm laparoscopic grasping forceps as well as Overholt clamps. For coagulation, a laparoscopic 5 mm diathermy Sealer (LigaSure™, Covidien, Neustadt) is used. Conclusion In selected tumours, laparoscopic assisted tumour mobilisation enables surgeons to clearly identify and ligate the primary tumour-supplying vascular structures at the beginning of the operation, thereby avoiding the risk of major bleeding throughout the subsequent tumour mobilisation. The laparoscopic approach also allows an accurate dissection and mobilisation of the supralevatory tumour parts under direct vision. After repositioning the patient into the prone position, infralevatory preparation can be carried out safely and fast in the conventional sacral approach without any major risk of bleeding.","Gödeke, Jan; Engel, Veronika; Münsterer, Oliver",Zentralblatt fur Chirurgie,624,20

Development of drug resistance against clinical anti-HBV drug lamivudine due to long-term use and rebound of viral DNA after cessation of treatment has been a major setback of the current therapy. We have synthesized a series of pyrimidine nucleosides possessing a variety of substituents at the C-5 position, and a 1-[(2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethoxy)methyl] flexible acyclic glycosyl moiety at the N-1 position, that have the ability to mimic the natural 2'-deoxyribosyl moiety. Some of these potential antiviral compounds included variations at both C-5 and C-6 positions of the uracil base. Other variations of the uracil derivatives were the 6-aza congeners. 4-Amino and 4-methoxy pyrimidine derivatives were also made. Compounds in which the base moiety was substituted by 5-chloro- (25), 5-(2-bromovinyl)- (32), or 5-bromo-6-methyl- (37) groups possess significant activity against duck-HBV, wild-type human HBV (2.2.15 cells), and lamivudine-resistant HBV containing single and double mutations. No cytotoxicity was seen in host HepG2 and Vero cells, up to the highest concentration tested. The anti-HBV activity exhibited by compounds 25, 32, and 37 was superior for human HBV and comparable for DHBV to that of the corresponding purine nucleoside, ganciclovir. Further, they were only 10-15-fold less inhibitory against human HBV in 2.2.15 cells than the reference drug, lamivudine. Other compounds in the series were moderately inhibitory against DHBV and wild-type human HBV. The size of the halogen and the electronegativity of the substituents at the 5- and 6-positions are important for antiviral activity toward HBV. These compounds were also evaluated for their antiviral activity for West Nile virus, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-coronavirus, and hepatitis C virus. They were generally inactive in these antiviral assay systems (at concentrations up to 100 microg/mL). 1-[(2-Hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl) ethoxy)methyl]-5-fluorocytosine (34) showed some inhibitory activity against hepatitis C virus. Taken together, these data support our previous observations that the 5-substituted pyrimidine nucleosides containing acyclic glycosyl moieties have potential to serve as a new generation of potent, selective, and nontoxic anti-HBV agents for wild-type and lamivudine-resistant mutant HBV.","Kumar, Rakesh; Semaine, Wassila; Johar, Monika; Tyrrell, D Lorne J; Agrawal, Babita",Journal of medicinal chemistry,624,1

RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 by itself is not an indication for cesarean section. Different publications demonstrated the efficacy of neuraxial analgesia/anesthesia for delivery. Although SARS-CoV-2 was associated with a certain neurotropism, neuraxial block was not associated with neurological damage in COVID-19 parturients, and seems as safe and effective as in normal situations. It permits to avoid a general anesthesia in case of intrapartum cesarean section. Epidural failure is a concern: it may lead to a general anesthesia in case of emergency cesarean section. Local protocols and well-trained anesthesiologists will be helpful. COVID-19 patients require special circuits and every step (transfer to and from theatre, recovery, analgesia, and so on) should be planned in advance. For cesarean section under general anesthesia, personal protection equipment must be enhanced. Postoperative analgesia with neuraxial opioids, NSAIDs, or regional blocks are recommended. COVID-19 and pregnancy increase the risk of thrombosis, so thromboprophylaxis has to be considered and protocolized. SUMMARY: Anesthetic care for delivery in COVID-19 parturients should include neuraxial blocks. Special attention should be paid on the risk of thrombosis.","Guasch, Emilia; Brogly, Nicolas; Gilsanz, Fernando",Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,624,1

We aimed to characterize skeletal muscle mitochondrial changes in response to a ketogenic diet combined with exercise training in healthy individuals. Twenty-nine physically active adults completed a 12-week supervised exercise program after self-selection into a ketogenic diet (KD, n=15) group or maintenance of their habitual mixed diet (MD, n=14). Measures of metabolic health and muscle biopsies (Vastus lateralis) were obtained before and after the intervention. Mitochondria were isolated from muscle and studied after exposure to carbohydrate (pyruvate), fat (palmitoyl-L-carnitine), and ketone (ß-hydroxybutyrate+acetoacetate) substrates. Compared to MD, the KD resulted in increased whole-body resting fat oxidation (p<0.001) and decreased fasting insulin (p=0.019), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, p=0.022), and visceral fat (p<0.001). The KD altered mitochondrial function as evidenced by increases in mitochondrial respiratory control ratio (19%, p=0.009), ATP production (36%, p=0.028), and ATP/H2O2 (36%, p=0.033) with the fat-based substrate. ATP production with the ketone-based substrate was 4 to 8 times lower than with other substrates, indicating minimal oxidation. The KD resulted in a small decrease in muscle glycogen (14%, p=0.035) and an increase in muscle triglyceride (81%, p=0.006). These results expand our understanding of human adaptation to a ketogenic diet combined with exercise. In conjunction with weight loss, we observed altered skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and efficiency, an effect that may contribute to the therapeutic use of ketogenic diets in various clinical conditions, especially those associated with insulin resistance.","Miller, Vincent J; LaFountain, Richard A; Barnhart, Emily; Sapper, Teyrn S; Short, Jay; Arnold, William David; Hyde, Parker N; Crabtree, Christopher D; Kackley, Madison L; Kraemer, William J; Villamena, Frederick; Volek, Jeffrey S",Am. j. physiol. endocrinol. metab,624,18

Of the restrictions enacted during COVID-19, among the more controversial surround alcohol. Like many infectious diseases, the principal mode of transmission for COVID-19 is direct respiration of droplets emitted during close social contact, and health officials warn that alcohol consumption may lead to decreased adherence to physical distancing guidelines. Governing bodies have acted to close bars before restaurants and have also specifically restricted alcohol sales, while at the same time those in the nightlife industry have labeled such actions unfounded and discriminatory. Complicating such debates is the lack of evidence on alcohol's effects on physical distance. In the current study we employed a randomized alcohol-administration design paired with computer-vision measures, analyzing over 20,000 proximity readings derived from video to examine the effect of alcohol consumption on physical distance during social interaction. Results indicated that alcohol caused individuals to draw significantly closer to an unfamiliar interaction partner during social exchange, reducing physical proximity at a rate with potentially important implications for public health. In contrast, alcohol had no effect on physical distance with a familiar interaction partner. Findings suggest that alcohol might act to overcome a natural caution people feel towards strangers and thus promote virus transmission between previously unconnected social groups.","Gurrieri, Laura; Fairbairn, Catharine E; Sayette, Michael A; Bosch, Nigel",Proc.

We use a in-house numerical code to solve the governing transport equations for the velocities and flow rates in a rotating channel subjected to an applied external electric field. We show the strong effect of polyelectrolyte layer on the flow behaviour and find an increase in flow rate as we increase the size of the polyelectrolyte layer. We also show that rheology strongly influences the interplay of the Coriolis forces due to rotation and electrical body force due to the applied electric field. We show that the velocities are generally higher for shear thinning fluids as compared to shear thickening fluids. We also show that presence of polymer brushes in the polyelectrolyte layer creates a drag on the fluid which reduces velocities. We also show that the flow rates are strongly altered by the effect of rotation and that shear thickening fluids have lower flow rates than shear thinning fluids. We believe that studying effect of fluid rheology becomes very important for designing soft channel based Lab-on-CD systems driven by electroosmotic forcing and dealing with rheologically complex bio-fluids such as blood, saliva or mucus.","Patel, Maneesh; Kruthiventi, S S Harish; Kaushik, P",,624,23

Social determinants of health, access and geographical differences pertaining both to population density and other location-based factors may also be important. Methods: We report 69 cases of acute stroke in patients positive for SARS-CoV-2, in a dichotomized analysis of ischemic stroke outcomes between patients of African American background versus all other backgrounds. All patients presented to 14 major hospitals in the United States and Canada, from March 14-April 14, 2020. All patients had nasopharyngeal swab samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on qualitative RT-PCR assays. Results: We found no significant difference in age (64.4 versus 62.9 years) or the proportion of females (51.9% versus 38.1%) (table 1). Diabetes mellitus was present significantly less in African American cases versus others (37% vs. 66.7%).

The aim of this study was to describe the COVID-19 cases during the first wave of the pandemic in Spain, how they managed the disease at home, focusing on differences by age, as well as differences in knowledge, attitudes and preventive practices, compared with the uninfected population. DESIGN: An online survey was used to conduct a cross-sectional study of individuals who were 14 years or older living in Spain during the COVID-19 lockdown. The main variable was a COVID-19 case. Logistic regression models for COVID-19 cases were obtained using a backward stepwise procedure to assess the association between social variables, disease knowledge, attitudes, prevention practices and emotional impact. RESULTS: 3398 people completed the survey. Participants' mean age was 49.6 (SD=14.3). COVID-19 was significantly more prevalent among married people (5.3%) and those currently doing an on-site work (8.7%). Most of the COVID-19 cases stayed at home (84.0%) during the episode. There were significant age-based differences with regard to self-isolation conditions at home during the disease. COVID-19 cases showed better attitudes, practices and knowledge about disease symptoms and transmission than the uninfected population. COVID-19 cases also felt more depressed (adjusted OR: 3.46, 95% CI 1.45 to 8.26) and had better preventive behaviour than the uninfected population, such as always wearing a mask outside the home (adjusted OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.30). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 cases found it difficult to comply with recommended home self-isolation conditions, with differences by age group. COVID-19 had an important impact on care dependency in non-hospitalised patients, who were mostly dependent on their families for care. It is necessary to reinforce social and health services and to be ready to meet the care needs of populations during the different waves or in future epidemics.","Romay-Barja, María; Pascual-Carrasco, Mario; De Tena-Dávila, María José; Falcón, María; Rodriguez-Blazquez, Carmen; Forjaz, Maria João; Ayala, Alba; Molina-de la Fuente, Irene; Burgos, Alfredo; Muñoz, Adolfo; Benito, Agustin",BMJ Open,624,7

Practicing social distancing, wearing masks and staying at home becomes voluntary and conditional on the behavior of others. We present the results of a large-scale survey experiment in nine countries with representative samples of the population. We find that both empirical expectations (what others do) and normative expectations (what others approve of) play a significant role in compliance, beyond the effect of any other individual or group characteristic. In our vignette experiment, respondents evaluate the likelihood of compliance with social distancing and staying at home of someone similar to them in a hypothetical scenario. When empirical and normative expectations of individuals are high, respondents' evaluation of the vignette's character's compliance likelihood goes up by 55% (relative to the low expectations condition). Similar results are obtained when looking at self-reported compliance among those with high expectations. Our results are moderated by individuals' trust in government and trust in science. Holding expectations high, the effect of trusting science is substantial and significant in our vignette experiment (22% increase in compliance likelihood), and even larger in self-reported compliance (76% and 127% increase before and after the lockdown). By contrast, trusting the government only generates modest effects. At the aggregate level, the country-level trust in science, and not in government, becomes a strong predictor of compliance.","Bicchieri, Cristina; Fatas, Enrique; Aldama, Abraham; Casas, Andrés; Deshpande, Ishwari; Lauro, Mariagiulia; Parilli, Cristina; Spohn, Max; Pereira, Paula; Wen, Ruiling",PLoS One,624,9

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised year-to-date intervention analyses of in- and outpatient key procedures, machine occupancy, and no-show rates in calendar weeks 12 to 19 of 2019 and 2020 to evaluate effects of active patient flow management while monitoring nosocomial COVID-19 infections. RESULTS: Active patient flow management helped to maintain first-visit appointment compliance above 85.5%. A slight appointment reduction of 10.3% daily (pâ¯= 0.004) could still significantly increase downstream planning CT scheduling (pâ¯= 0.00001) and performance (pâ¯= 0.0001), resulting in an absolute 20.1% (pâ¯= 0.009) increment of CT performance while avoiding overbooking practices. Daily treatment start was significantly increased by an absolute value of 18.5% (pâ¯= 0.026). Hypofractionation and acceleration were significantly increased (pâ¯= 0.0043). Integrating strict testing guidelines, a distancing regimen for staff and patients, hygiene regulations, and precise appointment scheduling, no SARS-CoV­2 infection in 164 tested radiation oncology service inpatients was observed. CONCLUSION: In times of reduced medical infrastructure capacities and resources, controlling infrastructural time per patient as well as optimizing facility utilization and personnel workload during treatment evaluation, planning, and irradiation can help to improve appointment compliance and quality management. Avoiding recurrent and preventable exposure to healthcare infrastructure has potential health benefits and might avert cross infections during the pandemic. Active patient flow management in high-risk COVID-19 regions can help Radiation Oncologists to continue and initiate treatments safely, instead of cancelling and deferring indicated therapies.","Akuamoa-Boateng, Dennis; Wegen, Simone; Ferdinandus, Justin; Marksteder, Regina; Baues, Christian; Marnitz, Simone",Strahlenther.

The positive result of nucleic acid test is a golden criterion to confirm SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the detection features remain unclear.METHODSWe performed a retrospective analysis in 5630 high-risk individuals receiving SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests in Wuhan, China, and investigated their characteristics and diagnosis rates.RESULTSThe overall diagnosis rate was 34.7% (1952/5630). Male (P = 0.025) and older populations (P = 2.525 × 10-39) were at significantly higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. People were generally susceptible, and most cases concentrated in people of 30-79 years. Furthermore, we investigated the association between diagnosis rate and the amount of testing in 501 subjects. Results revealed a 1.27-fold improvement (from 27.9% to 35.5%) of diagnosis rate from testing once to twice (P = 5.847 × 10-9) and a 1.43-fold improvement (from 27.9% to 39.9%) from testing once to 3 times (P = 7.797 × 10-14). More than 3 testing administrations was not helpful for further improvement. However, this improvement was not observed in subjects with pneumonia (P = 0.097).CONCLUSIONAll populations are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and male and older-aged populations are at significantly higher risk. Increasing the amount of testing could significantly improve diagnosis rates, except for subjects with pneumonia. It is recommended to test twice in those high-risk individuals whose results are negative the first time, and performing 3 tests is better, if possible.FUNDINGThis work was supported by National Mega Project on Major Infectious Disease Prevention (no. 2017ZX10103005-007) and National Key Research and Development Program of China (no. 2018YFE0204500).","Shen, Na; Zhu, Yaowu; Wang, Xiong; Peng, Jing; Liu, Weiyong; Wang, Feng; Lu, Yanjun; Cheng, Liming; Sun, Ziyong",JCI insight,624,14

The effect of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women and her neonate is not well-understood, with no clear evidence for vertical transmission. This study aims to determine the maternal and neonatal clinical characteristics and the dyad’s outcomes among those infected with COVID-19 infection. Methods. An ambispective cross-sectional study involving pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection was conducted at the Philippine General Hospital from April to August 2020. Two hundred nine obstetric patients were included, 14 of whom consented to specimen collection to determine vertical transmission. Results. The majority of pregnant women with COVID-19 infection and their neonates had good outcomes. Labor, delivery, and the immediate postpartum course were generally uneventful. The all-cause maternal morbidity rate was high at 75.6 per 100 cases during the five-month study period. COVID-19 related morbidities included the development of Guillain-Barré Syndrome. The in-hospital all-cause maternal mortality rate was 1.91 per 100 cases. The causes of maternal death were acute respiratory failure, septic shock, and congenital heart disease (atrial septal defect with Eisenmengerization). The in-hospital, all-cause neonatal mortality rate was 1.04 per 100 neonates of cases. The lone mother and infant deaths were in a postmortem rt-PCR swab negative mother with an rt-PCR swab positive live neonate who eventually succumbed after nine days of life. All 14 dyads with collected specimens that included amniotic fluid, placental tissue, umbilical cord, and neonate nasopharyngeal swab tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR. Conclusion. The prognosis for COVID-19 infected pregnant patients was generally good, with most of the patients discharged improved. Almost all of the neonates born to COVID-19-infected mothers were stable-term infants. There was no evidence for vertical transmission, as shown by negative rt-PCR results for all the additional specimens obtained. In general, the prognosis for COVID-19 infected dyads was good. The majority of the mothers were discharged well with their term infants. All possible maternal sources of COVID-19 infection to the neonate tested negative. This study provided no evidence for vertical transmission. © 2021 University of the Philippines Manila. All rights reserved.","Clemente, M. J. Q.; Amosco, M. D.; Octavio, M. B. R.; Bravo, S. L.

The tumor board activity was measured from tumor board sheets extracted from the oncologic electronic file between January 7, 2019 and April 24, 2020. The pre-containment activity was compared to the activity of the containment periods but also to the equivalent periods in 2019. The number of meetings held, the average number of files reviewed per meeting including first presentations and the average number of physicians' attendance were the evaluation criteria. The study covered 191 TB that held 3943 multidisciplinary team meetings (MTM) and reviewed 72,070 files (including 30,127 first submissions). There was a moderate decrease of 8 % in the number of meetings after March 16, 2020. The number of files examined decreased by 23 % in the following month and even more by 33 % in the third period. The physicians' number who attended MTM also decreased by 25 %. The negative impact was higher in the Mediterranean part of the region. This first study of tumor board activity, covering a large region but little affected by the pandemic, shows that its impact on the participation to the MTM has been moderate. In addition, tumor boards have followed the recommendations for optimizing quorum. However, the decrease in average MTM activity, particularly for first submissions, suggests a potential delay in patient management. Complementary qualitative and quantitative works are warranted to estimate the real impact on carcinologic outcomes.","Grosclaude, Pascale; Azria, David; Guimbaud, Rosine; Thibault, Séverine; Daubisse-Marliac, Laetitia; Cartron, Guillaume; Renaudie, Marie-José; Dalbies, Pierre-Adrien; Delord, Jean-Pierre; Bauvin, Eric",Bull Cancer,624,1

To contain the spread, it is very important to identify the subtle/not readily apparent symptoms of COVID-19 at the earliest. The aim of the study is to determine the incidence duration progress of sino-nasal symptoms in COV 2 positive patients using SNAQ scoring. Patients who tested positive for SARS-COV 2 by RT-PCR and admitted in our hospital under category A (n = 382) were included in the study. A detailed history was collected from all the patients and sino-nasal assessment questionnaire (SNAQ) was provided to the patient with complaints of sinonasal symptoms and they were asked to fill the forms on day 3, 7 and 14. To identify the characteristics of sinonasal symptoms in COVID-19 patients with a history of smoking, smoking history was also collected in detail and patients were classified based on Brinkman's index into mild, moderate and severe smokers. In this study, the incidence of sinonasal symptoms was 24%. Average SNAQ scoring on day 3 was 30.09 and on day 7 was 12.9 and day 14 is 3.8. There was a decline in score on day 7 compared to day 3 indicating symptoms decrease by day7. Average SNAQ scoring in non-smokers and mild and moderate smokers was 20.18, 34.11, 57.5 respectively. The SNAQ scoring in smokers was more than that of non-smokers and was also persistent for a longer duration compared to non-smokers. Sino-nasal symptoms catch our eye because it is an important route for transmission. Viral shedding from sinonasal tract may be an important source for transmission. History and degree of smoking should also be considered while dividing COVID-19 patients into categories.","Meenakshi, M; Raj, K Deepak; Nandhini, R",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,624,12

The government budget for the construction sector has been cut very significantly, which has a negative impact on stakeholders, especially causing financial problems for business actors in construction. In this study, the identification of the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic was carried out on the construction sector, especially in the implementation of contracts. The research method used is through a quantitative analysis with questionnaire data which is distributed to stakeholders involved in the implementation of construction contracts. The results of identification study through questionnaires show that 80% of construction projects are still running in the current COVID 19 pandemic condition. However, pandemic conditions affect project performance, especially at the time of project completion. In addition, in implementing the health protocol, assistance, additional costs, improvement of human resource capacity, and special equipment are required, so that the health protocol can be implemented properly. On the other hand, most stakeholders stated that the online coordination system during the pandemic for the implementation of construction projects tends to be less effective.

METHODS: Alive and disease-free HNSCC patients at least 1 year after treatment were enrolled in this cross-sectional multicentric study and completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 and H&N35 QoL questionnaires, the head and neck cancer-specific patient concerns inventory (PCI-HN) questionnaire and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS). Correlations between QoL outcomes and patient needs and concerns were investigated using Spearman's correlation tests. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were enrolled in the study. Fear of cancer recurrence was the main patient concern followed by dental, salivary, fatigue, speech, and eating problems. The leading patient needs in terms of consultation were to be referred to the surgeon, the speech, and swallow therapist and the oral rehabilitation team. The number of patient concerns correlated negatively (r < .40) with functioning scales score and positively (r > .40) with general and head and neck symptoms. Psychological distress was the main determinant of QoL outcomes (p < .0001). We found a significant impact of gender (p = .002) on the number of patient concerns, and of patient age (p = .003) on the number of staff members selected by patients. CONCLUSION: Identification of patient needs and concerns along with multidisciplinary management of persistent symptoms and psychological distress seem essential steps towards improving QoL of HNSCC patients.","Elaldi, Roxane; Roussel, Lise-Marie; Gal, Jocelyn; Scheller, Boris; Chamorey, Emmanuel; Schiappa, Renaud; Lasne-Cardon, Audrey; Louis, Marie-Yolande; Culié, Dorian; Dassonville, Olivier; Poissonnet, Gilles; Saada, Esma; Benezery, Karen; Babin, Emmanuel; Bozec, Alexandre",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,624,1

Objectives: To assess changes in audiometric hearing thresholds between pre-treatment values and two weeks into therapy. To document observed changes, and occurrence of ototoxicity within the period. Methods: Prospective analytical cohort study on drug-resistant tuberculosis patients. Basic demographic parameters were taken. Three-point audiometric assessments within two weeks into therapy were done. Percentage of patients with ototoxicity were calculated. Pure tone threshold changes between the three audiometric values were compared. Results: Audiograms of 53 patients comprising 56.6% males; age range was 13 to 91 years. Both air and bone conduction hearing thresholds significantly worsened between baseline and one week into therapy (p=0.011, and 0.015 respectively), and between baseline and two weeks into therapy (p=0.003 and 0.042 respectively). Minimal insignificant reduction occurred between both air and bone conduction hearing values of week 1 and week 2 of therapy (p= 1.000 and 0.856 respectively). By audiometric criteria, 4 patients (7.5%) developed ototoxicity within two weeks of treatment. Conclusion: Audiometric assessments within two weeks into therapy with anti-tuberculous therapy may not represent baseline audiometry. 7.5% of the patients developed ototoxicity within two weeks of therapy.","Sogebi, Olusola A; Adefuye, Bolanle O; Ajayi, Ebenezer A",Afr Health Sci,624,10

As a result of high mortality rate among the severe COVID-19 patients, the early detection of the disease stage and early effective interventions are very important in reducing mortality. Hence, it is important to differentiate severe and non-severe cases from each other. To date, there are no proven diagnostic or prognostic parameters that can be used in this manner. Due to the expensive and not easily accessible tests that are performed for COVID-19, researchers are investigating some parameters that can be easily used. In some recent studies, hematological parameters have been evaluated to see if they can be used as predictive parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the current study, almost all hematological parameters were used, including the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio, monocyte/lymphocyte ratio, mean platelet volume to lymphocyte ratio, mean platelet volume to platelet ratio, plateletcrit, and D-dimer/fibrinogen ratio (DFR), neutrophil/lymphocyte/platelet scoring system, and systemic immune-inflammation index. A total of 750 patients, who were admitted to Ankara City Hospital due to COVID-19, were evaluated in this study. The patients were classified into 2 groups according to their diagnosis (confirmed or probable) and into 2 groups according to the stage of the disease (non-severe or severe). RESULTS: The values of the combinations of inflammatory markers and other hematological parameters in all of the patients with severe COVID-19 were calculated, and the predicted values of these parameters were compared. According to results of the study, nearly all of the hematological parameters could be used as potential diagnostic biomarkers for subsequent analysis, because the area under the curve (AUC) was higher than 0.50, especially for the DFR and NLR, which had the highest AUC among the parameters. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that, the parameters those enhanced from complete blood count, which is a simple laboratory test, can help to identify and classify COVID-19 patients into non-severe to severe groups.","San, Ishak; GemcIoGlu, EmIn; DavutoGlu, Mehmet; ÇatalbaS, RamIs; KarabuGa, Berkan; Kaptan, Enes; Erden, Abdulsamet; KÜÇÜkSahIn, Orhan; AteS, Ihsan; KaraahmetoGlu, Selma; HasanoGlu, Imran; Inan, Osman; Ünal, BÜSra Nur; ErdemIr, Ecem; Kahraman, FatIh Ahmet; GÜner, HatIce Rahmet",Turkish journal of medical sciences,624,28

Investigations are warranted to predict the influences of implant macro-textures on bone on-growth pattern. Mechanoregulatory tissue differentiation algorithms can predict such patterns effectively. There is, however, a dearth of volumetric in silico study to assess the influence of macro-textures on bone growth. The present study investigated the influence of macro-textural grooves/ribs on changes in tissue formation at the bone-implant interface by carrying out a 3D finite element (FE) analysis. Three distinct macro-textures, loosely based on commercially viable hip stem models, were comparatively assessed for varying levels of interfacial micromotion. The study predicted elevated fibrogenesis and chondrogenesis, followed by a suppressed osteogenesis for higher levels of micromotion (60 µm and 100 µm), resulting in weak bone-implant interface strength. However, small judicious modifications in implant surface texture may enhance bone growth to a considerable extent. The numerical scheme can further be used as a template for more rigorous parametric and multi-scale studies.","Ghosh, Rajdeep; Chanda, Souptick; Chakraborty, Debabrata",Comput Biol Med,624,16

We measured vaccination coverage as the percent of the total population fully vaccinated as of July 15, 2021, with the exception of 11 Texas counties, where the cutoff date was July 14, 2021. We measured COVID-19 incidence as the number of confirmed cases per 100,000 population during the 14-day period ending August 12, 2021. We measured hospitalization rates as the number of confirmed COVID-19 admissions per 100,000 population during the same 14-day period. COVID-19 incidence was significantly higher among counties in the lower half of the distribution of vaccination coverage (incidence 543.8 per 100,000 among 56 counties with mean coverage 42.61%) than among counties in the lower half of the distribution of coverage (incidence 280.7 per 100,000 among 56 counties with mean coverage 57.37%, p < 0.0001). Hospital admissions were also significantly higher among counties in the lower half of the distribution (55.37 per 100,000) than in the upper half of the distribution (20.48 per 100,000, p < 0.0001). In log-linear regression models, a 10-percentage-point increase in vaccination coverage was associated with a 28.3% decrease in COVID-19 incidence (95% confidence interval, 16.8 - 39.7%), a 44.9 percent increase in the rate of COVID-19 hospitalization (95% CI, 28.8 - 61.0%), and a 16.6% decrease in COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100 cases (95% CI, 8.4 - 24.8%).

To evaluate the particular impact on neurological services a rapid review was conducted. METHODS: Studies reporting the provision of neurological services during the pandemic and/or adopted mitigation strategies were included in this review. PubMed and World Health Organization's (WHO) COVID-19 database were searched. Data extraction followed categories used by WHO COVID-19 pulse surveys and operational guidelines on maintaining essential health services during COVID-19. FINDINGS: The search yielded 1101 articles, of which 369 fulfilled eligibility criteria, describing data from 210,419 participants, being adults (81%), children (11.4%) or both (7.3%). Included articles reported data from 105 countries and territories covering all WHO regions and World Bank income levels (low income: 1.9%, lower middle: 24.7%, upper middle: 29.5% and high income; 44.8%). Cross-sectoral services for neurological disorders were most frequently disrupted (62.9%), followed by emergency/acute care (47.1%). The degree of disruption was at least moderate for 75% of studies. Travel restrictions due to lockdowns (81.7%) and regulatory closure of services (65.4%) were the most commonly reported causes of disruption. Authors most frequently described telemedicine (82.1%) and novel dispensing approaches for medicines (51.8%) as mitigation strategies. Evidence for the effectiveness of these measures is largely missing. INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic affects all aspects of neurological care. Given the worldwide prevalence of neurological disorders and the potential long-term neurological consequences of COVID-19, service disruptions are devastating. Different strategies such as telemedicine might mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic, but their efficacy and acceptability remain to be seen.","García-Azorín, David; Seeher, Katrin M; Newton, Charles R; Okubadejo, Njideka U; Pilotto, Andrea; Saylor, Deanna; Winkler, Andrea Sylvia; Charfi Triki, Chahnez; Leonardi, Matilde",J. neurol,624,20

We perform an observational study to investigate seroprevalence and immune responses in subjects professionally exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and their family members (155 individuals; ages 5-79 years). Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein aligns with PCR results that confirm the previous infection. Anti-Spike IgG/IgM titers remain high 60 days post-infection and do not strongly associate with symptoms, except for fever. We analyze PBMCs from a subset of seropositive and seronegative adults. TLR7 agonist-activation reveals an increased population of IL-6+TNF-IL-1ß+ monocytes, while SARS-CoV-2 peptide stimulation elicits IL-33, IL-6, IFNa2, and IL-23 expression in seropositive individuals. IL-33 correlates with CD4+ T cell activation in PBMCs from convalescent subjects and is likely due to T cell-mediated effects on IL-33-producing cells. IL-33 is associated with pulmonary infection and chronic diseases like asthma and COPD, but its role in COVID-19 is unknown. Analysis of published scRNAseq data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with mild to severe COVID-19 reveals a population of IL-33-producing cells that increases with the disease. Together these findings show that IL-33 production is linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection and warrant further investigation of IL-33 in COVID-19 pathogenesis and immunity.","Stanczak, Michal A; Sanin, David E; Apostolova, Petya; Nerz, Gabriele; Lampaki, Dimitrios; Hofmann, Maike; Steinmann, Daniel; Krohn-Grimberghe, Marvin; Thimme, Robert; Mittler, Gerhard; Waller, Cornelius F; Pearce, Edward J; Pearce, Erika L",Nat Commun,624,20

Data included 645 adults in the Utsunomiya COVID-19 seROprevalence Neighborhood Association (U-CORONA) study, which was conducted after the first wave of the pandemic, between 14 June 2020 and 5 July 2020, in Utsunomiya City. Social integration before the pandemic was assessed by counting the number of social roles, based on the Cohen's social network index. Face mask use before and during the pandemic was assessed by questionnaire, and participants were categorized into consistent mask users, new users, and current non-users. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between lower social integration score and face mask use. To account for possible differential non-response bias, non-response weights were used.

In high efficiency filters, nonwoven meshes, which show increased performance based on small fiber diameters (e.g., using nanofibers), can be used as fine particle filter layers. Nanofiber nonwoven meshes made by electrospinning of spider silk proteins have been recently shown to exhibit required filter properties. Needle-based electrospinning, however, is limited regarding its productivity and scalability. Centrifugal electrospinning, in contrast, has been shown to allow manufacturing of ultrathin polymer nonwoven meshes in an efficient and scalable manner. Here, continuous roll-to-roll production of nonwoven meshes made of recombinant spider silk proteins is established using centrifugal electrospinning. The produced spider silk nanofiber meshes show high filter efficiency in the case of fine particulate matter below 2.5 µm (PM2.5) and a low pressure drop, resulting in excellent filter quality.","Müller, Fabian; Zainuddin, Shakir; Scheibel, Thomas",Molecules (Basel),624,2

This study aimed to describe the clinical outcomes and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCW. METHODS: Three databases were surveyed and 328 articles were identified. Of these, 225 articles did not meet inclusion criteria; therefore, 97 full-text article were reviewed. Finally, after further revision, 30 articles were included in the systematic review and 28 were used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies were identified involving 119,883 patients. The mean age of the patients was 38.37 years (95% CI 36.72-40.03) and males comprised 21.4% (95% CI 12.4-34.2) of the population of HCW. The percentage of HCW who tested positive for COVID-19 was 51.7% (95% CI 34.7-68.2). The total prevalence of comorbidities in seven studies was 18.4% (95% CI 15.5-21.7). The most prevalent symptoms were fever 27.5% (95% CI 17.6-40.3) and cough 26.1% (95% CI 18.1-36). The prevalence of hospitalisation was 15.1% (95% CI 5.6-35) in 13 studies and of death was 1.5% (95% CI 0.5-3.9) in 12 studies. Comparisons of HCW with and without infection showed an increased relative risk for COVID-19 related to personal protective equipment, workplace setting, profession, exposure, contacts, and testing. CONCLUSION: A significant number of HCW were reported to be infected with COVID-19 during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a prevalence of hospitalisation of 15.1% and mortality of 1.5%. Further data are needed to track the continued risks in HCW as the pandemic evolves and health systems adapt.","Gholami, Mandana; Fawad, Iman; Shadan, Sidra; Rowaiee, Rashed; Ghanem, HedaietAllah; Hassan Khamis, Amar; Ho, Samuel B",Int J Infect Dis,624,26

Here, we investigated an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in a ""non-COVID-19"" hospital ward unveiled by massive testing, which challenged the reconstruction of transmission chains. The contacts network during the 15-day period before the screening was investigated, and positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA samples were subjected to virus genome sequencing. Of the 245 tested individuals, 48 (21 patients and 27 HCWs) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. HCWs were mostly asymptomatic, but the mortality among patients reached 57.1% (12/21). Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that all cases were part of the same transmission chain. By combining contact tracing and genomic data, including analysis of emerging minor variants, we unveiled a scenario of silent SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, mostly driven by the close contact within the HCWs group and between HCWs and patients. This investigation triggered enhanced prevention and control measures, leading to more timely detection and containment of novel outbreaks. This study shows the benefit of combining genomic and epidemiological data for disclosing complex nosocomial outbreaks, and provides valuable data to prevent transmission of COVID-19 in healthcare facilities.","Borges, Vítor; Isidro, Joana; Macedo, Filipe; Neves, José; Silva, Luís; Paiva, Mário; Barata, José; Catarino, Judite; Ciobanu, Liliana; Duarte, Sílvia; Vieira, Luís; Guiomar, Raquel; Gomes, João Paulo",Viruses,624,0

In the ongoing obesity pandemic, its coexistence with COVID-19 becomes worrying and has a less favorable outcome. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the clinical and epidemiological profiles of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in individuals with obesity in the state of Alagoas. METHODS: The observational cross-sectional study involving 138 confirmed cases of COVID-19 who had obesity as a comorbidity reported at the time of notification of the disease. The data were collected from the COVID-19 database in the state of Alagoas, and the variables analyzed were sex, age (and age group), race/color, outcome, clinical manifestations, and associated comorbidities. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Mann-Whitney U, &#967;², or Fisher's exact tests were performed as appropriate. The significance was set at 5 and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: There was a predominance of females (55.1%; n=76), aged &lt;60 years (70.3%; n=97) and brown race/color (n=76; 55.1%). The most prevalent symptoms were cough (n=84; 60.9%), fever (n=78; 56.5%), headache (n=36; 26.1%), and adynamia (n=28; 20.3%). The median age was 49 years, with no difference between genders (p=0.340). The lethality rate was 17.4% (n=24), being higher in the male population (22.6% in males and 13.2% in females). Of the 24 deaths, 13 (54.2%) were recorded in the elderly people. In addition to obesity, 54.3% (n=75) had systemic arterial hypertension and 30.4% (n=42) had diabetes mellitus. There was no difference in the prevalence of comorbidity between genders. CONCLUSIONS: The profile studied demonstrates that obesity represents a challenge for coping with COVID-19.","de Mélo, Kathleen Cézar; de Souza Lôbo, Jéssica Luzia; da Silva Junior, Adeilton Gonçalves; do Carmo, Rodrigo Feliciano; de Souza, Carlos Dornels Freire",Rev.

Using the US state-level data, our analysis finds that both policies and information on transmission risks are important determinants of people's social distancing behavior, and shows that a change in policies explains a large fraction of observed changes in social distancing behavior. Our counterfactual experiments indicate that removing all policies on April 1st of 2020 would have lead to 30 to 200 times more additional cases by late May. Removing only the non-essential businesses closures (while maintaining restrictions on movie theaters and restaurants) would have increased the weekly growth rate of cases between -0.02 and 0.06 and would have lead to -10% to 40% more cases by late May. Finally, nationally mandating face masks for employees on April 1st would have reduced the case growth rate by 0.1-0.25.

We aimed to study the outcomes of conservative treatment for GI bleeding in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, 24 of 1342 (1.8%) patients with COVID-19, presenting with GI bleeding from 22nd April to 22nd July 2020, were included. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 45.8 ± 12.7 years; 17 (70.8%) were males; upper GI (UGI) bleeding: lower GI (LGI) 23:1. Twenty-two (91.6%) patients had evidence of cirrhosis- 21 presented with UGI bleeding while one had bleeding from hemorrhoids. Two patients without cirrhosis were presumed to have non-variceal bleeding. The medical therapy for UGI bleeding included vasoconstrictors-somatostatin in 17 (73.9%) and terlipressin in 4 (17.4%) patients. All patients with UGI bleeding received proton pump inhibitors and antibiotics. Packed red blood cells (PRBCs), fresh frozen plasma (FFPs) and platelets were transfused in 14 (60.9%), 3 (13.0%) and 3 (13.0%), respectively. The median PRBCs transfused was 1 (0–3) unit(s). The initial control of UGI bleeding was achieved in all 23 patients and none required an emergency endoscopy. At 5-day follow-up, none rebled or died. Two patients later rebled, one had intermittent bleed due to gastric antral vascular ectasia, while another had rebleed 19 days after discharge. Three (12.5%) cirrhosis patients succumbed to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure during hospital stay. CONCLUSION: Conservative management strategies including pharmacotherapy, restrictive transfusion strategy, and close hemodynamic monitoring can successfully manage GI bleeding in COVID-19 patients and reduce need for urgent endoscopy. The decision for proceeding with endoscopy should be taken by a multidisciplinary team after consideration of the patient's condition, response to treatment, resources and the risks involved, on a case to case basis.","Shalimar; Vaishnav, Manas; Elhence, Anshuman; Kumar, Ramesh; Mohta, Srikant; Palle, Chandan; Kumar, Peeyush; Ranjan, Mukesh; Vajpai, Tanmay; Prasad, Shubham; Yegurla, Jatin; Dhooria, Anugrah; Banyal, Vikas; Agarwal, Samagra; Bansal, Rajat; Bhattacharjee, Sulagna; Aggarwal, Richa; Soni, Kapil D.; Rudravaram, Swetha; Singh, Ashutosh K.; Altaf, Irfan; Choudekar, Avinash; Mahapatra, Soumya J.; Gunjan, Deepak; Kedia, Saurabh; Makharia, Govind; Trikha, Anjan; Garg, Pramod; Saraya, Anoop",J Clin Exp Hepatol,624,1

The staging system was based on data points drawn from a comprehensive ophthalmic examination, diagnostic endoscopy, and appropriate imaging of orbit, paranasal sinuses and brain in post-COVID ROCM patients to formulate the final staging expressed as R0-3O0-3C0-3. Each stage in the sinus, orbit and brain was graded into three levels of severity of disease. Progressive stages necessitated more active and urgent intervention and poorer prognosis. Finally, ten consecutive ROCM patients were independently staged by two blinded clinicians by examining clinical photographs and radiological images and the results matched for concordance.Results: Each component of the staging: Rhino, Orbital, and Cerebral were graded 0-3 based on severity. Each stage was matched with a recommended management plan. The final ROC grading by two independent clinicians showed a high degree of concordance - maximum for orbit grade (100%) followed by brain (90%) and sinuses (80%). Overall R0-3O0-3C0-3 staging had 70% concordance. Extrapolation of final ROC staging of two clinicians showed 60% match. When we allowed for one-point difference in the ROC staging system the concordance between two clinicians improved to 100% and the management plan matched in 90%.Conclusion: The proposed ROC staging system based on objectively defined clinico-radiological criteria of the three components of COVID-related ROCM is simple-to-use and has high concordance when validated by independent clinicians. The staging helps devise a management plan and has prognostic value.","Naik, Milind N; Rath, Suryasnata",Seminars in ophthalmology,624,20

E-government and social media have been used widely during this unprecedented time to spread awareness and educate the public on preventive measures. However, the extent to which the 2 digital platforms bring to improve public health awareness and prevention during a health crisis is unknown. In this study, we examined the influence of e-government and social media on the public's attitude to adopt protective behavior. For this purpose, a Web survey was conducted among 404 Malaysian residents during the Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO) period in the country. Descriptive and multiple regression analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS software. Social media was chosen by most of the respondents (n = 331 or 81.9%) as the source to get information related to COVID-19. Multiple regression analysis suggests the roles of e-government and social media to be significantly related to people's attitudes to engage in protective behavior. In conclusion, during the COVID-19 outbreak, public health decision makers may use e-government and social media platforms as effective tools to improve public engagement on protective behavior. This, in turn, will help the country to contain the transmission of the virus.","Mat Dawi, Norazryana; Namazi, Hamidreza; Hwang, Ha Jin; Ismail, Suriani; Maresova, Petra; Krejcar, Ondrej",Front Public Health,624,14

In Ethiopia, as of September 27(th) 2020, a total of 72,700 cases and 1165 deaths were reported. Therefore, the study aimed to assess the determinants of death in severe COVID-19 patients admitted to millennium COVID-19 care center in Ethiopia. METHODS: a case-control study of 147 severe COVID-19 patients (49 deaths and 98 discharged alive cases) was conducted from August to September 2020. A comparison of underlying characteristics between cases (death) and controls (alive) was assessed using a chi-square test and an independent t-test with a p-value of <0.05 considered as having a statistically significant difference. Multivariable binary logistic regression was used to identify predictors of severe COVID-19 outcome (alive vs death) where adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 95% confidence interval (CIs) for AOR, and P-values were used for testing significance and interpretation of results. RESULTS: having diabetes mellitus (AOR= 3.257, 95%CI=1.348,7.867, p-value <0.001), fever (AOR=0.328, 95%CI= 0.123,0.878, p-value=0.027) and shortness of breath (AOR=4.034, 95%CI=1.481,10.988, p-value=0.006) were found to be significant predictors of death in severe COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: the outcome of death in severe COVID-19 patients is found to be associated with exposures to being diabetic and having shortness of breath at admission. On the other hand, having a fever at admission was associated with a favorable outcome of being discharged alive.","Leulseged, Tigist Workneh; Maru, Endalkachew Hailu; Hassen, Ishmael Shemsedin; Zewde, Wuletaw Chane; Chamiso, Negat Woldehawariat; Abebe, Daniel Simeneh; Jagema, Tariku Bahiru; Banegyisa, Abdi Bekele; Gezahegn, Mesfin Abebe; Tefera, Oli Seyoum; Shiferaw, Wondmagegn Genaneh; Admasu, Teketel Tilahun",Pan Afr Med J,624,20

While the breadth of emerging research has been instrumental in understanding and curbing the global pandemic in near real-time, unfortunately manuscripts with major methodological challenges have fallen through the cracks. In this perspective, we illustrate this issue in light of a recent manuscript by Piquero et al. (2020). In the study, a statistically significant association between stay-at-home orders and family violence was not detected; however, the authors widely disseminated a “12.5% increase in family violence” offenses to a variety of media outlets. This negligent dissemination of inaccurate research findings has important implications for policy and the virus mitigation efforts, which might urge policymakers to terminate stay-at-home orders in an effort to reduce family violence and other social risk factors. Changes may ultimately result in more COVID-related deaths as stay-at-home orders are prematurely and inappropriately lifted to prevent purported injuries in the home. Therefore, the widespread propagation of these claims in the absence of scientific evidence of an increase has great potential to cause harm.","Reingle Gonzalez, Jennifer M.; Molsberry, Rebecca; Maskaly, Jonathan; Jetelina, Katelyn K.",Am J Crim Justice,624,16

We set out in this paper to compare Covid-19 results by country to better understand the factors leading to the differing results found internationally. Methods. We used publicly available large datasets to explore differences by the country for Covid-19 mortality statistics. We continuously challenged our projections with reality and numbers from countries around the world, allowing us to refine our models and better understand the progression of the epidemic. All our predictions and findings were discussed and validated from a clinical viewpoint. Results. While no lockdown resulted in higher mortality, the difference between strict lock-down and a lax lockdown was not terribly different and favored lax lockdown. Only one of the top 44 countries had long and strict restrictions. Strict restrictions were more common in the worst-performing countries in terms of Covid mortality. The United States had the largest economic growth coupled with the largest rate of mortality. Those who did well economically had lower mortality and less pressure on their population. Yet they had less mortality than average and less than their neighbors. Conclusions. Countries with the least restrictions fared best economically. Some of them fared well in terms of mortality, even better than neighboring countries with similar social structures and more severe restrictions. The mortality rates in the USA, however, appeared to suffer from very high obesity rates. Norway and the northern European countries have less strict restrictions from the rest of Europe and had lower mortality rates. COVID-19 mortality was associated with vitamin D status.","Mehl-Madrona, L. E.; Bricaire, F.; Cuyugan, A.; Barac, J.; Parvaiz, A.; Jamil, A. B.; Iqbal, S.; Vally, R.; Koliali, M.; Sellier, M.

A Randomized Controlled Study",23.191181,3.9276183,2021-05-25,"OBJECTIVES: In the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is playing an important role in diagnosis and monitoring of patients with COVID-19. We propose a deep learning model for detection of COVID-19 from CXRs, as well as a tool for retrieving similar patients according to the model’s results on their CXRs. For training and evaluating our model, we collected CXRs from inpatients hospitalized in four different hospitals. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 1384 frontal CXRs, of COVID-19 confirmed patients imaged between March and August 2020, and 1024 matching CXRs of non-COVID patients imaged before the pandemic, were collected and used to build a deep learning classifier for detecting patients positive for COVID-19. The classifier consists of an ensemble of pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNS), specifically, ReNet34, ReNet50¸ ReNet152, and vgg16, and is enhanced by data augmentation and lung segmentation. We further implemented a nearest-neighbors algorithm that uses DNN-based image embeddings to retrieve the images most similar to a given image. RESULTS: Our model achieved accuracy of 90.3%, (95% CI: 86.3–93.7%) specificity of 90% (95% CI: 84.3–94%), and sensitivity of 90.5% (95% CI: 85–94%) on a test dataset comprising 15% (350/2326) of the original images. The AUC of the ROC curve is 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93–0.97). CONCLUSION: We provide deep learning models, trained and evaluated on CXRs that can assist medical efforts and reduce medical staff workload in handling COVID-19. KEY POINTS: • A machine learning model was able to detect chest X-ray (CXR) images of patients tested positive for COVID-19 with accuracy and detection rate above 90%. • A tool was created for finding existing CXR images with imaging characteristics most similar to a given CXR, according to the model’s image embeddings.

The telemedicine BMP consisted of video and/or phone call visits (remote) or a single initial in-person visit followed by remote visits (hybrid). We hypothesized that patient/family satisfaction of a telemedicine BMP would be comparable to an in-person BMP and that there would be improvement in quality of life and functional outcomes after the telemedicine BMP. METHODS: After IRB approval, demographic and outcomes data were obtained for patients who underwent the telemedicine BMP from May-October 2020. Outcomes included a parent/patient satisfaction survey, Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), and parent/patient-reported outcome measures (Vancouver, Baylor, and Cleveland scores) at baseline, 1-, and 3-month follow-up. Variables were compared using Chi-square or Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests and a generalized mixed model was used to evaluate outcomes scores at follow-up compared to baseline. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were included in our analysis with an average age of 8.6 years (SD: 3.9). Patients had the following diagnoses: anorectal malformation (52.2%), Hirschsprung's disease (20.9%), functional constipation (19.4%), myelomeningocele (6.0%), and spinal injury (1.5%). Forty-eight patients (72%) underwent the remote BMP and 19 (28%) underwent the hybrid BMP. Sixty-two percent of parents completed the satisfaction survey, with a median score of 5 (very satisfied) for all questions. Over 75% of parents said they would prefer a telemedicine program over an in-person program. There was significant improvement in the Baylor and Vancouver scores after the BMP (p<0.01), but no difference in the PedsQL or Cleveland scores (p>0.05). There was a significant improvement in stool continence after the BMP (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: A telemedicine BMP can be an acceptable alternative to a traditional in-person program. There was high parental/patient satisfaction and significant improvement in outcomes. Further research is needed to assess long-term outcomes.","Knaus, Maria E.; Ahmad, Hira; Metzger, Gregory A.; Beyene, Tariku J.; Thomas, Jessica L.; Weaver, Laura J.; Gasior, Alessandra C.; Wood, Richard J.; Halaweish, Ihab",J Pediatr Surg,624,16

The urodynamic parameters under isoflurane and α-chloralose were also examined in terminal procedures for four cats. Δpressure was greatest with propofol, bladder capacity was highest with α-chloralose, non-voiding contractions were greatest with α-chloralose. Propofol and dexmedetomidine had the highest bladder pressure slopes during the initial and final portions of the cystometrograms respectively. Cats progressed to a deeper plane of anesthesia (lower HR, smaller ΔHR, decreased reflexes) under dexmedetomidine, compared to propofol and alfaxalone. Time to induction was shortest with propofol, and time to recovery was shortest with dexmedetomidine. These agent-specific differences in urodynamic and anesthetic parameters in cats will facilitate appropriate study-specific anesthetic choices.","Xu, Jiajie Jessica; Yousuf, Zuha; Ouyang, Zhonghua; Kennedy, Eric; Lester, Patrick A.; Martin, Tara; Bruns, Tim M.",Sci Rep,624,33

The majority of new infections are now being reported outside of China, where the outbreak officially originated in December 2019 in Wuhan. Despite the wide outbreak of the infection, a remarkable asymmetry is observed in the number of cases and in the distribution of the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms in patients with respect to the countries/regions. In the early stages of a new pathogen outbreak, it is critical to understand the dynamics of the infection transmission, in order to follow contagion over time and project the epidemiological situation in the near future. While it is possible to reason that observed variation in the number and severity of cases stem from the initial number of infected individuals, the difference in the testing policies and social aspects of community transmissions, the factors that could explain high discrepancy in areas with a similar level of healthcare still remain unknown. Here we introduce a binary classifier based on an artificial neural network that can help in explaining those differences and that can be used to support the design of containment policies.

It has been observed that lethality seems to be related to the age of patients. While ageing has been extensively demonstrated to be accompanied by some modifications at the gene expression level, a possible link with COVID-19 manifestation still need to be investigated at the molecular level. Objectives: This study aims to shed out light on a possible link between the increased COVID-19 lethality and the molecular changes that occur in elderly people. Methods: We considered public datasets of ageing-related genes and their expression at the tissue level. We selected human protein interacting with viral ones that are known to be related to the ageing process. Finally, we investigated changes in the expression level of coding genes at the tissue, gender and age level. Results: We observed a significant intersection between some SARS-CoV-2 interactors and ageing-related genes, suggesting that those genes are particularly affected by COVID-19 infection. Our analysis evidenced that virus infection particularly involves ageing molecular mechanisms centred around proteins EEF2, NPM1, HMGA1, HMGA2, APEX1, CHEK1, PRKDC, and GPX4. We found that HMGA1 and NPM1 have different expressions in the lung of males, while HMGA1, APEX1, CHEK1, EEF2, and NPM1 present changes in expression in males due to ageing effects. Conclusion: Our study generated a mechanistic framework to clarify the correlation between COVID-19 incidence in elderly patients and molecular mechanisms of ageing.

METHODS: Using the test-negative, case-control design, data for 2017–2018 and 2018–2019 influenza seasons were collected using: 1) consent, specimen collection, RT-PCR testing and vaccine verification using multiple methods; and 2) an administrative database of outpatients with a clinical respiratory viral panel combined with electronic immunization records. Odds ratios for likelihood of influenza infection by vaccination status were calculated using multivariable logistic regression. VE = (1 − aOR) × 100. RESULTS: Research participants were significantly younger (P < 0.001), more often white (69% vs. 59%; P < 0.001) than non-white and less frequently enrolled through the emergency department (35% vs. 72%; P < 0.001) than administrative database participants. VE was significant against all influenza and influenza A in each season and both seasons combined (37–49%). Point estimate differences between methods were evident, with higher VE in the research database, but insignificant due to low sample sizes. When enrollment sites were separately analyzed, there were significant differences in VE estimates for all influenza (66% research vs. 46% administrative P < 0.001) and influenza A (67% research vs. 49% administrative; P < 0.001) in the emergency department. CONCLUSIONS: The selection of the appropriate method for determining influenza vaccine effectiveness depends on many factors, including sample size, subgroups of interest, etc., suggesting that research estimates may be more generalizable. Other advantages of research databases for VE estimates include lack of clinician-related selection bias for testing and less misclassification of vaccination status. The advantages of the administrative databases are potentially shorter time to VE results and lower cost.","Balasubramani, G.K.; Zimmerman, Richard K; Eng, Heather; Lyons, Jason; Clarke, Lloyd; Nowalk, Mary Patricia",Vaccine,624,16

This work evaluates trainee perspectives of the impact of the pandemic on medical genetics education. METHODS: A Qualtrics survey was sent to physician trainees who rotated in genetics before or midpandemic. Questions assessed patient care, didactic education, and competency in multiple domains. Number of clinic visits completed by trainees were collated through review of documentation. RESULTS: Twenty-three rotating residents completed the surveys. Five of the pediatric residents completed the elective during the pandemic. All residents participated in virtual care during the pandemic, and rotating residents reported an improvement in self-assessed competency in multiple domains. Potential weak areas of education midpandemic included dysmorphology and genetic counseling. CONCLUSION: Residents on a genetics elective can gain crucial skills and knowledge even when the rotation is in a primarily virtual format. Supplemental dysmorphology and genetic counseling education may improve remote educational experiences. Further research across institutions may deepen understanding of the impact of the pandemic on education in genetics.","Pritchard, Amanda Barone; Sloan-Heggen, Christina; Keegan, Catherine E.; Quinonez, Shane C.",Genet Med,624,16

The influence of particle coverage and structure is described using a universal correction function in an ab initio manner. Explicit analytical expressions for the frequency and dissipation shifts are derived for the entire range of particle size under the rigid contact regime. The solvent coupling functions are also calculated to determine the dry coverage using the QCM measurements. These expressions furnish the upper limit of the QCM signal, which can be attained for a sensor providing perfect adhesion of particles. Correction functions accounting for the finite adhesion strength (soft contact regime) are also derived. The theoretical results are confronted with QCM and atomic force microscopy measurements of positively charged polymer particle deposition on silica sensors. The main features of the theoretical model are confirmed, especially the abrupt decrease in the QCM wet mass with the particle coverage and the overtone number. The latter effect is especially pronounced for microparticles under the soft contact regime, where the higher-number overtones produce a negligible QCM signal. These results represent a useful reference data for the interpretation of protein and bioparticles, for example, virus and bacteria attachment processes to various substrates.","Adamczyk, Zbigniew; Sadowska, Marta; Żeliszewska, Paulina",Anal Chem,624,20

The development of efficient drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 requires detailed knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 biology. Several techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection have been established, mainly based on counting infected cells by staining plaques or foci, or by quantifying the viral genome by PCR. These methods are laborious, time-consuming and expensive and therefore not suitable for a high sample throughput or rapid diagnostics. We here report a novel enzyme-based immunodetection assay that directly quantifies the amount of de novo synthesized viral spike protein within fixed and permeabilized cells. This in-cell ELISA enables a rapid and quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection in microtiter format, regardless of the virus isolate or target cell culture. It follows the established method of performing ELISA assays and does not require expensive instrumentation. Utilization of the in-cell ELISA allows to e.g. determine TCID(50) of virus stocks, antiviral efficiencies (IC(50) values) of drugs or neutralizing activity of sera. Thus, the in-cell spike ELISA represents a promising alternative to study SARS-CoV-2 infection and inhibition and may facilitate future research.","Conzelmann, Carina; Gilg, Andrea; Groß, Rüdiger; Schütz, Desiree; Preising, Nico; Ständker, Ludger; Jahrsdörfer, Bernd; Schrezenmeier, Hubert; Sparrer, Konstantin M.J.; Stamminger, Thomas; Stenger, Steffen; Münch, Jan; Müller, Janis A.",Antiviral Res,624,26

However, sampling viable airborne viruses is challenging as conventional bioaerosol sampling devices operate on inertia-based mechanisms that inherently have low sampling efficiency for virus aerosols in the ultrafine size range (< 100 nm). Herein, a Batch Adiabatic-expansion for Size Intensification by Condensation (BASIC) approach was developed for efficient sampling of virus aerosols. The BASIC utilizes adiabatic expansion in a supersaturated container to activate condensation of water vapor onto virus aerosol particles, thus amplifying the size of the particles by orders of magnitude. Using aerosolized MS2 bacteriophage, the BASIC's performance was evaluated and optimized both from the perspectives of physical size amplification as well as preservation of the viability of the MS2 bacteriophage. Experimental results show that one compression/expansion (C/E) cycle under a compression pressure of 103.5 kPa and water temperature of 25 °C was sufficient to increase the particle diameter from < 100 nm to > 1 µm; further increases in the number of C/E cycles neither increased particle number concentration nor diameter. An increase in compression pressure was associated with physical size amplification and a higher concentration of collected viable MS2. Water temperature of 40 °C was found to be the optimal for size amplification as well as viability preservation. No significant effect on particle size enlargement was observed by changing the dwell time after expansion. The results illustrate the BASIC's capability as a simple, quick and inexpensive tool for rapid sampling of viable airborne viruses.","Yu, Haoran; Afshar-Mohajer, Nima; Theodore, Alexandros D.; Lednicky, John A.; Fan, Z.

In order to assess the effects of COVID-19 on care of patients with acromegaly, we conducted an international online survey of endocrinologists. The questionnaire was drafted by a Steering Committee of acromegaly experts and covered both respondent demographics, contact and communication with patients, and patient care. Respondent awareness was generated through social media campaigns and the survey completed online using Google forms. The majority of endocrinologists who responded (N = 84) were based in Europe (67.9%) and were female (58.3%). Slightly more than half of respondents worked in a specialized pituitary center (52.4%) and a large minority cared for more than 50 acromegaly patients (47.6%). Most respondents (85.7%) indicated surgery was their first-line treatment, with only 14.3% indicating medical therapy as a first-choice treatment option. One-third (33.3%) of respondents reported having delayed a planned surgery due to a lack of COVID-19 testing provision and 54.8% due to a lack of surgical provision; 19.1% indicated that a lack of personal protective equipment had reduced their ability to treat patients with acromegaly. Just 21.4% of respondents reported no negative effects from the pandemic on diagnostic practice patterns, and just 19.1% reported no negative effect on patient follow-up practices. Many respondents (55.9%) indicated that remote methods had improved their ability to communicate with their patients and 69.0% indicated that they would continue to use methods of consultation necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our data suggest the COVID-19 pandemic is substantially affecting the care of acromegaly. However, these results also suggest that endocrinologists are embracing aspects of the ‘new normal’ to create a novel continuum of care better suited to the presumed post-COVID-19 environment. The goal of these changes must be both to improve care while shielding patients from more severe involvement in concomitant acute illnesses such COVID-19.","Giustina, Andrea; Legg, Ewen; Cesana, Bruno Mario; Frara, Stefano; Mortini, Pietro; Fleseriu, Maria",Endocrine,624,16

However, the biological mechanisms are largely unknown. This study was novel in confirming the extensive nuclear distribution of the androgen receptor (AR) and its co-localization with viral oncoprotein of latency-associated nuclear antigen in KS lesions, indicating a transcription way of AR in KS pathogenesis. The endogenous AR was also remarkably higher in KSHV-positive B cells than in KSHV-negative cells and responded to the ligand treatment of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), the agonist of AR. Then, the anti-AR antibody-based chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-associated sequencing was used to identify the target viral genes of AR, revealing that the AR bound to multiple regions of lytic genes in the KSHV genome. The highest peak was enriched in the core promoter sequence of polyadenylated nuclear RNA (PAN), and the physical interaction was verified by ChIP–polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Consistently, male steroid treatment significantly transactivated the promoter activity of PAN in luciferase reporter assay, consequently leading to extensive lytic gene expression and KSHV production as determined by real-time quantitative PCR, and the deletion of nuclear localization signals of AR resulted in the loss of nuclear transport and transcriptional activity in the presence of androgen and thus impaired the expression of PAN RNA. Oncogenically, this study identified that the AR was a functional prerequisite for cell invasion, especially under the context of KSHV reactivation, through hijacking the PAN as a critical effector. Taken together, a novel mechanism from male sex steroids to viral noncoding RNA was identified, which might provide a clue to understanding the male propensity in KS.","Ding, Mingzhu; Wu, Jinfeng; Sun, Rui; Yan, Lijun; Bai, Lei; Shi, Jiajian; Feng, Hua; Zhang, Yuqi; Lan, Ke; Wang, Xing",PLoS Pathog,624,21

Methods: Adult patients with COVID-19 and self-reported sudden-onset olfactory dysfunction were recruited through a public call for participation from the University of Mons. Demographic data, pathologic conditions, general and otolaryngological symptoms were collected, and general nasal complaints were evaluated with the sino-nasal outcome-22 (SNOT-22). Subjective olfactory and gustatory status was evaluated with the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHNES) and the short version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements. Objective olfactory status was evaluated using an objective psychophysical test (Identification Sniffin Stick test). Results : 86 patients completed the study. The mean age was 42 + or - 12 years. The most common symptoms were fatigue (75%), headache (63%), nasal obstruction (58%), dysgeusia (51%), postnasal drip (49%), cough (49%) and myalgia (46%). On NHNES, total loss of taste and smell were reported by 51% and 74% of patients, respectively. 65% of patients reported a total loss of smell, while the remainder reported a partial loss. Objective olfactory testing found 41 anosmic (48%), 12 hyposmics (14%), and 33 normosmics (38%) patients. There was no correlation between the objective test results and subjective reports of nasal obstruction or postnasal drip, these complaints were absent in 69% of anosmic patients.

Therefore, we systematically searched three databases: Medline, Embase, and PsychInfo (until October 2020), and performed a grey literature search (until February 2021). We identified 46 suitable articles from 24 quantitative and 11 qualitative studies, 6 systematic reviews, 3 study protocols and 1 intervention. The assessment of stigmatization varied widely, ranging from a single-item question to a 22-item questionnaire. Studies mostly considered perceived self-stigma (27 of 35 original studies) in healthcare workers (HCWs) or hospital-related jobs (29 of 35). All articles reported on stigmatization as a result of work-related COVID-19 exposure. However, most quantitative studies were characterized by convenience sampling (17 of 24), and all studies—also those with an adequate sampling design—were considered of low methodological quality. Therefore, it is not possible to determine prevalence of stigmatization in defined occupational groups.

Here we conceptualize a recursive model where an initial COVID-19 supply-side shock hits first the Global North that, mediated by country-specific epidemic management strategies and other (fiscal, monetary, trade) policy responses feeds through to financial markets and the real economy. Analytically we distinguish two stylized scenarios: an optimistic V-shaped recovery where effective policy responses render most economic damages transitory, versus a pessimistic pathway of economic depression, where short-run pandemic impacts are dwarfed by the subsequent economic breakdown. Economic impacts are transitioned from the global North to the South through trade, tourism, remittances and investment/capital flows. As for impacts on tropical forests, we compare the effects of past economic crises to early indicators for incipient trends. We find national income and commodity price effects to be torn between three forces: a contractive-inflationary supply-side shock, deflationary pandemic demand-side effects, and expansive-inflationary monetary and fiscal policy responses. We discuss how global forest outcomes will depend on how these macroeconomic battles are resolved, but also on geographical differences in deforestation dynamics. Reviewing recent fire and deforestation alerts data, as well as annual tree-cover loss data, we find that deforestation-curbing and -enhancing factors so far just about neutralized each other. Yet, country impacts vary greatly. Changing macroeconomic scenarios, such as fading out of huge economic stimulus packages, could change the picture significantly, in line with what our model predicts.","Wunder, Sven; Kaimowitz, David; Jensen, Stig; Feder, Sarah",For Policy Econ,624,1

METHODS: In this RCT, SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients aged 18-85 years with asymptomatic to mild COVID-19 symptoms <8 days were recruited. A total of 176 eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to CDCM or placebo. Three rinses daily were performed for 7 days. Saliva sampling was performed on day 1 at 9 a.m. (T1), 1 p.m. (T2) and 6 p.m. (T3). On the following 6 days, one sample was taken at 3 p.m. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated that, over the course of one day, CDCM was significantly more effective than placebo 4 hours after the first dose (p=0.036), with a median percentage (log10 copies/mL) decrease T1-T2 of -12.58% [-29.55% - -0.16%]. The second dose maintained the low median value for the CDCM (3.08 log(10) copies/mL [0 - 4.19]), compared to placebo (3.31 [1.18 - 4.75]). At day 7, there was still a greater median percentage (log(10) copies/mL) decrease in salivary viral load over time in the CDCM group (-58.62% [-100% - -34.36%]) compared to placebo group (-50.62% [-100% - -27.66%]). These results were confirmed by the per-protocol analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This trial supports the relevance of using CDCM on day 1 (4 hours after the initial dose) to reduce the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in saliva. For long term effect (7 days), CDMC appears to provide a modest benefit compared to placebo in reducing viral load in saliva.","Carrouel, Florence; Valette, Martine; Gadea, Emilie; Esparcieux, Aurélie; Illes, Gabriela; Langlois, Marie Elodie; Perrier, Hervé; Dussart, Claude; Tramini, Paul; Ribaud, Mélina; Bouscambert-Duchamp, Maude; Bourgeois, Denis",Clin Microbiol Infect,624,16

For students’ perception of the course (N = 219), results indicated that most students were positive in their learning experience and satisfied with course design, lecturer quality and the benefits of the course to their development. Students’ changes and subjective perceptions were positively correlated, but with a low effect size. The findings reflected that online service leadership course adopting asynchronous or synchronous mode was effective, and students were positive about their learning experience.","Zhu, Xiaoqin; Shek, Daniel T.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: this is a collaborative Spanish and European bone marrow transplantation groups retrospective multicentre study, which included allo-HCT recipients (adults and children) with upper and/or lower respiratory tract disease (U/LRTD) caused by seasonal HCoV diagnosed through multiplex PCR assays from January 2012 to January 2019. RESULTS: We included 402 allo-HCT recipients who developed 449 HCoV U/LRTD episodes. Median age of recipients was 46 years (range 0.3-73.8 years). HCoV episodes were diagnosed at a median of 222 days after transplantation. The most common HCoV subtype was OC43 (n=170, 38%). LRTD involvement occurred in 121 episodes (27%). HCoV infection frequently required hospitalization (18%), oxygen administration (13%) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (3%). Three-month overall mortality after HCoV detection was 7% in the whole cohort and 16% in those with LRTD. We identified 3 conditions associated with higher mortality in recipients with LRTD: absolute lymphocyte count <0.1 x10 (9)/mL [hazard ratio (HR), 10.8], corticosteroid (HR 4.68) and ICU admission (HR 8.22) (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Seasonal HCoV after allo-HCT may involve the LRTD in many instances, leading to a significant morbidity.","Piñana, Jose Luis; Xhaard, Aliénor; Tridello, Gloria; Passweg, Jakob; Kozijn, Anne; Polverelli, Nicola; Heras, Inmaculada; Perez, Ariadna; Sanz, Jaime; Berghuis, Dagmar; Vázquez, Lourdes; Suárez-Lledó, María; Itäla-Remes, Maija; Ozcelik, Tulay; Iturrate Basarán, Isabel; Karakukcu, Musa; Al Zahrani, Mohsen; Choi, Goda; Cuesta Casas, Marián Angeles; Batlle Massana, Montserrat; Viviana, Amato; Blijlevens, Nicole; Ganser, Arnold; Kuskonmaz, Baris; Labussière-Wallet, Hélène; Shaw, Peter J; Arzu Yegin, Zeynep; González-Vicent, Marta; Rocha, Vanderson; Ferster, Alina; Knelange, Nina; Navarro, David; Mikulska, Malgorzata; de la Camara, Rafael; Styczynski, Jan",J Infect Dis,624,1

By the first week of April, more than 900,000 positive cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, although this number could be greatly underestimated. In the case of an epidemic emergency, the first line of response should be based on commercially available and validated resources. Here, we demonstrate the combined use of the miniPCR, a commercial compact and portable PCR device recently available on the market, and a commercial well-plate reader as a diagnostic system for detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. We used the miniPCR to detect and amplify SARS-CoV-2 DNA sequences using the sets of initiators recommended by the World Health Organization for targeting three different regions that encode for the N protein. Prior to amplification, samples were combined with a DNA intercalating reagent (i.e., EvaGreen Dye). Sample fluorescence after amplification was then read using a commercial 96-well plate reader. This straightforward method allows the detection and amplification of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids in the range of ~625 to 2 x 105 DNA copies. The accuracy and simplicity of this diagnostics strategy may provide a cost-efficient and reliable alternative for COVID-19 pandemic testing, particularly in underdeveloped regions where RT-qPCR instrument availability may be limited. The portability, ease of use, and reproducibility of the miniPCR makes it a reliable alternative for deployment in point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 detection efforts during pandemics.","Gonzalez-Gonzalez, Everardo; Trujillo-de Santiago, Grissel; Lara-Mayorga, Itzel Montserrat; Martinez-Chapa, Sergio Omar; Alvarez, Mario Moises",,624,7

This implies a worsening of patient's prognosis and an increase in morbidity and mortality. The metabolic pathways and molecular factors involved in the genesis of this injury are still unknown. Therefore, we aimed to carry out an integrative review about the pathophysiology and possible molecular mechanisms of liver injury by COVID-19. METHODS: We carried out an integrative literature review in the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Embase from December 2020 to March 2021 using the following descriptors: # 1 “COVID-19” (MeSH) AND / OR # 2 “Liver injury” (MeSH) AND / OR # 3 “Pathophysiology” (MesH). RESULTS: The data were extracted and divided into two main themes, for heuristic purposes: “Hepatotropism and SARS-CoV-2”, and “Pathophysiological hypotheses for liver injury associated with SARS-CoV-2”. CONCLUSIONS: The virus seems to promote liver damage through five mechanisms: direct injury, humoral and cellular inflammatory response, hypoxemia caused by a decrease in the effective circulating volume, reinfection through the portal system, and use of drugs in the treatment. The literature also points out that the expression of the angiotensin-converting enzyme II and transmembrane serine protease 2 receptors is expressive in cholangiocyte and is present in hepatocytes, which is a risk factor for the virus to enter these cells. Finally, patients with previous liver disease appear to be more susceptible to liver injury by COVID-19.","Moreira, Jorge Lucas de Sousa; Barbosa, Sarah Maria de Sousa; Júnior, Jucier Gonçalves",Clin Res Hepatol Gastroenterol,624,1

The acute inflammatory response to injury, stress, or infection comprises the release of cytokines and phagocytosis of damaged cells. Accumulating evidence indicates chronic microglia-mediated inflammation in diseases of the central nervous system, most notably neurodegenerative disorders, that is associated with disease progression. To understand microglia function in pathology, knowledge of microglia communication with their surroundings during normal state and the release of neurotrophins and growth factors in order to maintain homeostasis of neural circuits is of importance. Recent evidence shows that microglia interact with serotonin, the neurotransmitter crucially involved in adult neurogenesis, and known for its role in antidepressant action. In this chapter, we illustrate how microglia contribute to neuroplasticity of the hippocampus and interact with local factors, e.g., BDNF, and external stimuli that promote neurogenesis. We summarize the recent findings on the role of various receptors in microglia-mediated neurotransmission and particularly focus on microglia’s response to serotonin signaling. We review microglia function in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration and discuss their novel role in antidepressant mechanisms.

Researchers have suggested that family-based interventions may improve physical activity behaviors of both children and their parents. In this study, we evaluated the “Active 1 + FUN” program, which was designed based on tenets of self-determination theory. Intervention components included free sporting equipment, ten coach-led workshops and activity sessions, and one booster session. METHODS: We evaluated the intervention program using a randomized controlled trial. One hundred seventy-one families were randomly allocated to either an experimental group or a wait-list control group. Participants were exposed to program contents over a nine-month period, while families in the control did not receive any form of intervention. Measured constructs included moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, co-physical activity behaviors, fundamental movement skills, BMI, and several self-reported questionnaire outcomes. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to compare changes in measured outcomes across the two groups. RESULTS: No significant intervention effects were found for children’s and parents’ accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, or their co-physical activity.

The aim of this study was to assess changes in STEMI management during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Using a multicenter, nationwide, retrospective, observational registry of consecutive patients who were managed in 75 specific STEMI care centers in Spain, we compared patient and procedural characteristics and in-hospital outcomes in 2 different cohorts with 30-day follow-up according to whether the patients had been treated before or after COVID-19. RESULTS: Suspected STEMI patients treated in STEMI networks decreased by 27.6% and patients with confirmed STEMI fell from 1305 to 1009 (22.7%). There were no differences in reperfusion strategy (> 94% treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention in both cohorts). Patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention during the COVID-19 outbreak had a longer ischemic time (233 [150-375] vs 200 [140-332] minutes, P < .001) but showed no differences in the time from first medical contact to reperfusion. In-hospital mortality was higher during COVID-19 (7.5% vs 5.1%; unadjusted OR, 1.50; 95%CI, 1.07-2.11; P < .001); this association remained after adjustment for confounders (risk-adjusted OR, 1.88; 95%CI, 1.12-3.14; P = .017). In the 2020 cohort, there was a 6.3% incidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The number of STEMI patients treated during the current COVID-19 outbreak fell vs the previous year and there was an increase in the median time from symptom onset to reperfusion and a significant 2-fold increase in the rate of in-hospital mortality. No changes in reperfusion strategy were detected, with primary percutaneous coronary intervention performed for the vast majority of patients.

Most general hospital wards have ventilation systems that drive air and thus contaminants from the patient areas towards the corridors. This study investigates the transport mechanism and deposition patterns of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) within a typical six bedded general inpatient ward cubicle through numerical simulation. It demonstrates that both air change and exhaust airflow rates have significant effects on not only the airflow but also the particle distribution within a mechanically ventilated space. Moreover, the location of an infected patient within the ward cubicle is crucial in determining the extent of infection risk to other ward occupants. Hence, it is recommended to provide exhaust grilles in close proximity to a patient, preferably above each patient’s bed. To achieve infection prevention and control, high exhaust airflow rate is also suggested. Regardless of the ventilation design, all patients and any surfaces within a ward cubicle should be regularly and thoroughly cleaned and disinfected to remove microbial contamination. The outcome of this study can serve as a source of reference for hospital management to better ventilation design strategies for mitigating the risk of infection.","Satheesan, Manoj Kumar; Mui, Kwok Wai; Wong, Ling Tim",Build Simul,624,1

The psychological status was evaluated using the Symptom Check List 90 Revised (SCL-90). Linear and logistic regression analysis were used to examine the effect in the study. RESULTS: Of the 922 participants, approximately 18.3% had psychological health problems. The score of the SCL-90 was significant higher in medical staff (mean = 1.49) than that in general population (mean = 1.36). In addition, the participants enrolled in March were less likely to have psychological health problems than in February (odds ratio = 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.30 to 0.59). Female had a 1.44-fold risk of psychological health problems than male (95% CI = 1.01 to 2.03). CONCLUSIONS: In the study, 18.3% had psychological health problems during the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. With the remission of the epidemic, the psychological health status of participants has been improved. Medical staff were likely to have higher SCL-90 scores than general population and female had more psychological problems than male. Our findings can be used to formulate psychological interventions for improving the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Zhu, Zhen; Liu, Qi; Jiang, Xiaobing; Manandhar, Upasana; Luo, Zhongyu; Zheng, Xu; Li, Yuanyuan; Xie, Jun; Zhang, Bo",J Psychiatr Res,624,16

The outbreak caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 had a low rate of disease transmission and death cases. Modes of entry by MERS and SARS coronaviruses are similar to that of SARS-CoV-2, except MERS-CoV utilize different receptor. They all belong to the lineage C of β-coronavirus. Based on the information from the previous reports, the present review is mainly focused on the mechanisms of disease progression by each of these viruses in association to their strategies to escape the host immunity. The viral entry is the first step of pathogenesis associated with attachment of viral spike protein with host receptor help releasing the viral RNA into the host cell. Models of molecular pathogenesis are outlined with virus strategies escaping the host immunity along with the role of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the process. The molecular aspects of pathogenesis have also been discussed.","Noor, Rashed",Arch Microbiol,624,1

Our aim was to identify whether there are socio-demographic factors among COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Spain and their potential impact on health outcomes during the hospitalization. METHODS: A multicentric retrospective case series study based on administrative databases that included all COVID-19 cases admitted in 19 Spanish hospitals from 1 March to 15 April 2020. Socio-demographic data were collected. Outcomes were critical care admission and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: We included 10,110 COVID-19 patients admitted to 18 Spanish hospitals (median age 68 (IQR 54–80) years old; 44.5% female; 14.8% were not born in Spain). Among these, 779 (7.7%) cases were admitted to critical care units and 1678 (16.6%) patients died during the hospitalization. Age, male gender, being immigrant, and low hospital saturation were independently associated with being admitted to an intensive care unit. Age, male gender, being immigrant, percentile of average per capita income, and hospital experience were independently associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Social determinants such as residence in low-income areas and being born in Latin American countries were associated with increased odds of being admitted to an intensive care unit and of in-hospital mortality. There was considerable variation in outcomes between different Spanish centers.

METHODS: We evaluated ordering patterns during cardiovascular (CV) telehealth clinic visits in the Duke University Health System between March 15 - June 30, 2020 and 30-day outcomes compared with in-person visits in the same time frame in 2020 and in 2019. RESULTS: Within the Duke University Health System, there was a 33.1% decrease in the number of outpatient CV visits conducted in the first 15 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with the same time period in 2019. As a proportion of total visits initially booked, 53% of visits were cancelled in 2020 compared to 35% in 2019. However, patients with cancelled visits had similar demographics and comorbidities in 2019 and 2020. Telehealth visits comprised 9.3% of total visits initially booked in 2020, with younger and healthier patients utilizing telehealth compared with those utilizing in-person visits. Compared with in-person visits in 2020, telehealth visits were associated with fewer new (31.6% for telehealth vs 44.6% for in person) or refill (12.9% vs 15.6%, respectively) medication prescriptions, ECGs (4.3% vs 31.4%), laboratory orders (5.9% vs 21.8%), echocardiograms (7.3% vs 98.%), and stress tests (4.4% vs 6.6%). When adjusted for age, race, and insurance status, those who had a telehealth visit or cancelled their visit were less likely to have an emergency department (ED) or hospital encounter within 30 days compared with those who had in-person visits (aRR 0.76 [95% 0.65, 0.89] and aRR 0.71 [95% 0.65, 0.78], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In response to the perceived risks of routine medical care affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, different phenotypes of patients chose different types of outpatient cardiology care.

An initial assessment of the potential effects of COVID-19 emission reductions was made using a set of six scenarios that variously assumed annual European and global emission reductions of 30% and 50% for the energy, industry, road transport and international shipping sectors, and 80% for the aviation sector. The greatest ozone reductions during the growing season reached up to 12 ppb over crop growing regions in Asia and up to 6 ppb in North America and Europe for the 50% global reduction scenario. In Europe, ozone responses are more sensitive to emission declines in other continents, international shipping and aviation than to emissions changes within Europe. We demonstrate that for wheat the overall magnitude of ozone precursor emission changes could lead to yield improvements between 2% and 8%. The expected magnitude of ozone precursor emission reductions during the Northern Hemisphere growing season in 2020 presents an opportunity to test and improve crop models and experimentally based exposure response relationships of ozone impacts on crops, under real-world conditions.

Six identical ECMO circuits were primed with fresh human whole blood and maintained under physiological conditions at 36 °C for 24 h. A dose of nutritional supplement calculated for a 70 kg patient was added. 150 mL volume was drawn from the priming bag for control samples and kept under similar conditions. Blood samples were obtained at predetermined time points and analyzed for concentrations of vitamins, minerals, lipids, and proteins. Data were analyzed using mixed models with robust standard errors. No significant differences were found between the ECMO circuits and the controls for any of the measured variables: cobalamin, folate, vitamin A, glucose, minerals, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides or total proteins. There was an initial decrease and then an increase in the concentration of cobalamin and folate. Vitamin A concentrations decreased in both groups over time. There was a decrease in concentration of glucose and an increased concentration of lactate dehydrogenase over time in both groups. There were no significant alterations in the concentrations of nutritional supplements in an ex vivo ECMO circuit compared to control samples.

Summary MTM clinical pharmacists at JHHCG collaborate with patients to identify barriers to adherence, review medications, and develop plans for improvement. Through improved medication adherence, the goals for this program are to reduce side effects, patient cost, and medical visits or hospital admissions. Central to this practice is the belief that strong patient relationships are necessary to uncover the root cause of medication non-adherence. In Postgraduate Year 1 (PGY-1) community-based pharmacy residency training, new pharmacists learn the value of building relationships with patients and working through complex problems during this clinical experience. By assisting patients with complex medical conditions and social situations, new pharmacists gain skills in patient care, pharmacy operations, and medication access challenges. As the COVID-19 pandemic forced the discontinuation of face-to-face interactions in this setting, rotation experiences for residents were adapted with the goal of continuing high-impact patient interactions and keeping everyone involved safe. Conclusion Although significant changes were made to the MTM rotation because of the COVID-19 pandemic, residents were still able to provide meaningful clinical care telephonically and continued to learn valuable patient care skills. Most importantly, high quality care was still delivered to the patients despite considerable challenges. The major drawback for the residents’ clinical experiences as a result of the adjustments has been finding an impactful volume of complex patients to enhance their skills. Other residency programs are encouraged to consider three recommendations to improve their rotations moving forward.","Pennock, Danielle; Barbour, Lauren; Green, Robert; Fu, Denise",J Am Pharm Assoc (2003),624,16

We examined the hypothesis that bacteria and viruses may modulate this heterogeneity and that interactions between bacterial and viral infection may affect changes in airway bacterial load and the clinical features and inflammatory responses of exacerbations in patients with COPD. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Outpatient Department, London Chest Hospital, London, UK. PATIENTS: Thirty-nine patients with COPD. MEASUREMENTS: We prospectively studied 56 COPD exacerbations, obtaining clinical data and paired sputum and serum samples at baseline and exacerbation. Qualitative and quantitative microbiology, polymerase chain reaction detection for rhinovirus, and estimation of cytokine levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were performed. RESULTS: A total of 69.6% of exacerbations were associated with a bacterial pathogen, most commonly Haemophilus influenzae. Rhinovirus was identified in 19.6% of exacerbations. The rise in bacterial load at exacerbation correlated with the rise in sputum interleukin (IL)-8 (r = 0.37, p = 0.022) and fall in FEV(1) (r = 0.35, p = 0.048). Exacerbations with both rhinovirus and H influenzae had higher bacterial loads (10(8.56) cfu/mL vs 10(8.05)cfu/mL, p = 0.018) and serum IL-6 (13.75 pg/mL vs 6.29 pg/mL, p = 0.028) than exacerbations without both pathogens. In exacerbations with both cold symptoms (a marker of putative viral infection) and a bacterial pathogen, the FEV(1) fall was greater (20.3% vs 3.6%, p = 0.026) and symptom count was higher (p = 0.019) than those with a bacterial pathogen alone. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical severity and inflammatory responses in COPD exacerbations are modulated by the nature of the infecting organism: bacterial and viral pathogens interact to cause additional rises in inflammatory markers and greater exacerbation severity.","Wilkinson, Tom M.A.; Hurst, John R.; Perera, Wayomi R.; Wilks, Mark; Donaldson, Gavin C.; Wedzicha, Jadwiga A.",Chest,624,22

Les patients atteints de cancers semblent être plus vulnérables à la COVID-19. En outre, plus de la moitié des patients atteints de COVID-19 semblent être asymptomatiques. Ainsi, les stratégies de dépistage pourraient être utiles pour assurer la continuité des soins ainsi que la sécurité des patients et des personnels soignants. Nous rapportons ici les résultats préliminaires d’une stratégie de dépistage systématique par scanographie thoracique et polymerase chain reaction (PCR) pour les patients recevant une radiothérapie. Matériel et méthodes Une acquisition thoracique en inspiration bloquée était proposée lors de la scanographie dosimétrique des patients recevant une radiothérapie. L’imagerie était relue par un radiologue et classée selon le COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (Co-RADS). Une PCR de dépistage du severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, responsable de la COVID-19) sur un prélèvement nasopharyngé était proposée par l’oncologue radiothérapeute en cas d’anomalie sur l’imagerie, ou de contexte clinique évocateur. Les données relatives à la survenue d’une COVID-19 en cours de radiothérapie ont aussi été recueillies afin d’estimer l’incidence des cas de COVID-19 dans le service de radiothérapie. Résultats et analyse statistique Du 18 mars au 1er mai 2020, 507 scanographies dosimétriques ont été réalisées dans le service, dont 445 avec une coupe thoracique, pour un total de 449 patients. En tout, 237 scanographies (soit 53 %) présentaient des images pulmonaires anormales, dont 34 (soit 8 %) étaient compatibles avec la COVID-19 (grade 3 ou plus selon la classification Co-RADS). Cent-deux patients ont été testés par PCR après la scanographie thoracique. Dix-neuf patients sur les 449 ayant eu une scanographie dosimétrique durant cette période ont été confirmés comme infectés par le SARS-CoV-2 par PCR, et cinq ont été considérés atteints sur la base de l’imagerie malgré des PCR négatives, soit une incidence de 5,3 % (24 cas sur 449) sur la période. Le diagnostic de COVID-19 était connu chez huit de ces 24 patients (soit 33 %) avant la radiothérapie, dont quatre avaient toujours une PCR positive lors de la scanographie dosimétrique, à distance de la première PCR positive connue (8j, 36j, 40j, 56, respectivement). Quatre cas (soit 17 %) ont été diagnostiqués en cours de radiothérapie, dont trois par dépistage systématique avant la chimioradiothérapie, et un seul selon les symptômes. Durant cette période, 169 autres patients en cours de traitement ont eu leur scanographie de radiothérapie avant le 18 mars et n’ont pas eu d’acquisition thoracique systématique. Parmi eux, six cas d’infection par le SARS-CoV-2 (soit 3,6 %) ont été diagnostiqués par PCR en cours de radiothérapie, réalisée pour des symptômes dans quatre cas et par dépistage systématique pour les deux autres. En tout, sur les 30 patients atteints de COVID-19, seulement huit (soit 27 %) avaient des symptômes lors de la PCR, et dix (soit 33 %) ont rapporté un antécédent de symptômes évocateurs. Douze patients (soit 40 %) n’ont rapporté aucun symptôme et ont ainsi bénéficié du dépistage. Deux décès (soit 7 %) imputables à la COVID-19 ont été à déplorer. Conclusion Cette étude confirme la part importante de patients asymptomatiques atteints de COVID-19 et suggère l’intérêt d’un dépistage systématique par scanographie et PCR.","Sun, R.; Ammari, S.; Achkar, S.; Bockel, S.; Douir, N.; Mevel, G.; Diop, K.; Corbin, S.; Hubert, F.; Brusadin, G.; Merad, M.; Ka, K.; Bossi, A.; Rivera, S.; Chargari, C.; Deutsch, É.",Cancer/Radiothérapie,624,26

In the United States of America, the vast majority of Aedes-borne infections are imported from endemic regions by travelers, who can become new sources of mosquito infection upon their return home if the exposed population is susceptible to the disease, and if suitable environmental conditions for the mosquitoes and the virus are present. Since the susceptibility of the human population can be determined via periodic monitoring campaigns, the environmental suitability for the presence of mosquitoes and viruses becomes one of the most important pieces of information for decision makers in the health sector. We present a next-generation monitoring and forecasting system for [Formula: see text] -borne diseases’ environmental suitability (AeDES) of transmission in the conterminous United States and transboundary regions, using calibrated ento-epidemiological models, climate models and temperature observations. After analyzing the seasonal predictive skill of AeDES, we briefly consider the recent Zika epidemic, and the compound effects of the current Central American dengue outbreak happening during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to illustrate how a combination of tailored deterministic and probabilistic forecasts can inform key prevention and control strategies .","Muñoz, Á.

The mechanisms of susceptibility to infection in smokers may include alteration of the structural, functional and immunologic host defences. Smoking is one of the main risk factors for infections in the respiratory tract, digestive tract, reproductive tract, and other systems in humans, increasing the prevalence of HIV, tuberculosis, SARS-CoV, and the current SARS-CoV-2. Smoking cessation can reduce the risk of infection. Smoking increases the incidence of infections and aggravates the progress and prognosis of infectious diseases in a dose-dependent manner.

Given the widespread use of ACEi/ARBs worldwide, guidance on the use of these drugs is urgently needed. This prospective meta-analysis aims to pool data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the safety and efficacy of ACEi/ARB therapy in adults infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: RCTs will be eligible if they compare patients with COVID-19 randomised to ACEi/ARB continuation or commencement versuss no ACEi/ARB therapy; study duration ≥14 days; recruitment completed between March 2020 and May 2021. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality at ≤30 days. Secondary outcomes will include mechanical ventilation, admission to intensive care or cardiovascular events at short-term follow-up (≤30 days) and all-cause mortality at longer-term follow-up (>1 month). Prespecified subgroup analyses will assess the effect of sex; age; comorbidities; smoking status; ethnicity; country of origin on all-cause mortality. A search of ClinicalTrials.gov has been performed, which will be followed by a formal search of trial registers, preprint servers, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify RCTs that meet inclusion criteria. To date, a search of ClinicalTrials.gov identified 21 potentially eligible trials for this meta-analysis. We will request trial investigators/sponsors to contribute standardised grouped tabular outcome data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval and informed consent will be the responsibility of the individual RCTs. Dissemination of results will occur by peer-reviewed publication.

The aim of the study was to elucidate the association between antecedent statin exposure and 30-day all-cause mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Observational cohort study derived from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse of all veterans tested positive for COVID-19 between January 1st and May 31st, 2020. Antecedent use of statins was defined as a redeemed drug prescription in the 6 months prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Propensity-matched mixed-effects logistic regression was performed, stratified by statin use. The study population comprised 14,268 patients with COVID-19 (median age 66 years (25th–75th percentile, 53–74), 90.7% men), of whom 7,168 were receiving a prescription for statins. Patients with statin exposure had a greater prevalence of comorbidities and a higher risk of mortality (Odd ratio [OR] 1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37–1.68). After adjusting for covariates, statin exposure was not associated with a decreased mortality in the overall cohort by either Cox proportional hazards stratified model (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.88–1.12) or propensity matching (HR .86; 95% CI 0.74–1.01). Similarly, there was no demonstrated advantage of statins in reducing the risk of ICU admission (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.74–1.31) or hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.81–1.29).

Mainstream diagnostic assays are challenged by their intrinsic diversity, leading to false negatives and incomplete characterisation. New sequencing techniques are expanding our ability to agnostically interrogate nucleic acids within diverse sample types, but in the clinical setting are limited by overwhelming host material and ultra-low target frequency. Through selective host RNA depletion and compensatory protocol adjustments for ultra-low RNA inputs, we are able to detect three major blood-borne RNA viruses – HIV, HCV and HEV. We recovered complete genomes and up to 43% of the genome from samples with viral loads of 10(4) and 10(3) IU/ml respectively. Additionally, we demonstrated the utility of this method in detecting and characterising members of diverse RNA virus families within a human plasma background, some present at very low levels. By applying this method to a patient sample series, we have simultaneously determined the full genome of both a novel subtype of HCV genotype 6, and a co-infecting human pegivirus.

This study aims to assess the clinical utility of the C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-Dimer levels for predicting in-hospital outcomes in COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed to determine the association of CRP and D-Dimer with the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), dialysis, upgrade to an intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality. Independent t-test and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed to calculate mean differences and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI), respectively. RESULTS: A total of 176 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were included. On presentation, the unadjusted odds for the need of IMV (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.3–4.8, p = 0.012) and upgrade to ICU (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.6–6.5, p = 0.002) were significantly higher for patients with CRP (>101 mg/dl). Similarly, the unadjusted odds of in-hospital mortality were significantly higher in patients with high CRP (>101 mg/dl) and high D-Dimer (>501 ng/ml), compared to corresponding low CRP (<100 mg/dl) and low D-Dimer (<500 ng/ml) groups on day-7 (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.2–10.5, p = 0.03 and OR 10.0, 95% CI 1.2–77.9, p = 0.02), respectively. Both high D-Dimer (>501 ng/ml) and high CRP (>101 mg/dl) were associated with increased need for upgrade to the ICU and higher requirement for IMV on day-7 of hospitalization. A multivariate regression model mirrored the overall unadjusted trends except that adjusted odds for IMV were high in the high CRP group on day 7 (aOR 2.5, 95% CI 1.05–6.0, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: CRP value greater than 100 mg/dL and D-dimer levels higher than 500 ng/ml during hospitalization might predict higher odds of in-hospital mortality. Higher levels at presentation might indicate impending clinical deterioration and the need for IMV.","Ullah, Waqas; Thalambedu, Nishanth; Haq, Shujaul; Saeed, Rehan; Khanal, Shristi; Tariq, Shafaq; Roomi, Sohaib; Madara, John; Boigon, Margot; Haas, Donald C.; Fischman, David L.",Journal of community hospital internal medicine perspectives,624,26

The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) previously made available a tool for validating and annotating influenza virus sequences that is used to check submissions to GenBank. Before this project, there was no analogous tool in use for non-influenza viral sequence submissions. RESULTS: We developed a system called VADR (Viral Annotation DefineR) that validates and annotates viral sequences in GenBank submissions. The annotation system is based on the analysis of the input nucleotide sequence using models built from curated RefSeqs. Hidden Markov models are used to classify sequences by determining the RefSeq they are most similar to, and feature annotation from the RefSeq is mapped based on a nucleotide alignment of the full sequence to a covariance model. Predicted proteins encoded by the sequence are validated with nucleotide-to-protein alignments using BLAST. The system identifies 43 types of “alerts” that (unlike the previous BLAST-based system) provide deterministic and rigorous feedback to researchers who submit sequences with unexpected characteristics. VADR has been integrated into GenBank’s submission processing pipeline allowing for viral submissions passing all tests to be accepted and annotated automatically, without the need for any human (GenBank indexer) intervention. Unlike the previous submission-checking system, VADR is freely available (https://github.com/nawrockie/vadr) for local installation and use. VADR has been used for Norovirus submissions since May 2018 and for Dengue virus submissions since January 2019. Since March 2020, VADR has also been used to check SARS-CoV-2 sequence submissions. Other viruses with high numbers of submissions will be added incrementally. CONCLUSION: VADR improves the speed with which non-flu virus submissions to GenBank can be checked and improves the content and quality of the GenBank annotations. The availability and portability of the software allow researchers to run the GenBank checks prior to submitting their viral sequences, and thereby gain confidence that their submissions will be accepted immediately without the need to correspond with GenBank staff. Reciprocally, the adoption of VADR frees GenBank staff to spend more time on services other than checking routine viral sequence submissions.","Schäffer, Alejandro A.; Hatcher, Eneida L.; Yankie, Linda; Shonkwiler, Lara; Brister, J.

There is a steady increase in both the number of laboratories and scientist handling emerging viruses for diagnostics and research. The potential for harm associated to work with these infectious agents can be minimized through the application of sound biosafety concepts and practices. The main factors to the prevention of laboratory-acquired infection are well-trained personnel who are knowledgable and biohazard aware, who are perceptive of the various ways of transmission, and who are professional in safe laboratory practice management. In addition, we should emphasize that appropriate facilities, practices and procedures are to be used by the laboratory workers for the handling of emerging viruses in a safe and secure manner.

ABSTRACT: Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) is expressed in B-lymphocytes, myeloid cells and platelets, and Btk-inhibitors (BTKi) are used to treat patients with B-cell malignancies, developed against autoimmune diseases, have been proposed as novel antithrombotic drugs, and been tested in patients with severe COVID-19. However, mild bleeding is frequent in patients with B-cell malignancies treated with the irreversible BTKi ibrutinib and the recently approved 2nd generation BTKi acalabrutinib, zanubrutinib and tirabrutinib, and also in volunteers receiving in a phase-1 study the novel irreversible BTKi BI-705564. In contrast, no bleeding has been reported in clinical trials of other BTKi. These include the brain-penetrant irreversible tolebrutinib and evobrutinib (against multiple sclerosis), the irreversible branebrutinib, the reversible BMS-986142 and fenebrutinib (targeting rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematodes), and the reversible covalent rilzabrutinib (against pemphigus and immune thrombocytopenia). Remibrutinib, a novel highly selective covalent BTKi, is currently in clinical studies of autoimmune dermatological disorders. This review describes twelve BTKi approved or in clinical trials.
