59346,Assessment of Effects on Prolonged Usage of Face Mask by ENT Professionals During Covid-19 Pandemic,2021-10-08,"Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease with a high rate of progression to critical illness. However, the stratification of patients at risk of mortality is not well defined. In this study, we aimed to define a mortality risk index to allocate patients to the appropriate intensity of care. Methods: This is a 12 months observational longitudinal study designed to develop and validate a pragmatic mortality risk score to stratify COVID-19 patients aged ≥18 years and admitted to hospital between March 2020 and March 2021. Main outcome was in-hospital mortality. Results: 244 patients were included in the study (mortality rate 29.9%). The Covid-19 Assessment for Survival at Admission (CASA) index included seven variables readily available at admission: respiratory rate, troponin, albumin, CKD-EPI, white blood cell count, D-dimer, Pa02/Fi02. The CASA index showed high discrimination for mortality with an AUC of 0.91 (sensitivity 98.6%; specificity 69%) and a better performance compared to SOFA (AUC = 0.76), age (AUC = 0.76) and 4C mortality (AUC = 0.82). The cut-off identified (11.994) for CASA index showed a negative predictive value of 99.16% and a positive predictive value of 57.58%. Conclusions: A quick and readily available index has been identified to help clinicians stratify COVID-19 patients according to the appropriate intensity of care and minimize hospital admission to patients at high risk of mortality.","Bagnato, Gianluca; La Rosa, Daniela; Ioppolo, Carmelo; De Gaetano, Alberta; Chiappalone, Marianna; Zirilli, Natalia; Viapiana, Valeria; Tringali, Maria Concetta; Tomeo, Simona; Aragona, Caterina Oriana; Napoli, Francesca; Lillo, Sara; Irrera, Natasha; Roberts, William Neal; Imbalzano, Egidio; Micari, Antonio; Ventura Spagnolo, Elvira; Squadrito, Giovanni; Gangemi, Sebastiano; Versace, Antonio Giovanni",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514624/,824

195742,"[SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: not at the end of doubts, questions and controversies].",2020,"Nowadays, scientists may learn a lot about the organisms studied just by analyzing their genetic material. This requires the development of methods of reading genomes with high accuracy. It has become clear that the knowledge of the changes occurring within a viral genome is indispensable for effective fighting of the pathogen. A good example is SARS-CoV, which was a cause of death of many people and frightened the entire world with its fast and hard to prevent propagation. Rapid development of sequencing methods, like shotgun sequencing or sequencing by hybridization (SBH), gives scientists a good tool for reading genomes. However, since sequencing methods can read fragments of up to 1000 bp only, methods for sequence assembling are required in order to read whole genomes. In this paper a new assembling method, based on graph theoretical approach, is presented. The method was tested on SARS-CoV and the results were compared to the outcome of other widely known methods.","Błazewicz, Jacek; Figlerowicz, Marek; Formanowicz, Piotr; Kasprzak, Marta; Nowierski, Bartosz; Styszyński, Rafał; Szajkowski, Lukasz; Widera, Pawł; Wiktorczyk, Mariusz",Acta biochimica Polonica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15625570/,824

Despite increasing knowledge about hemorrhagic fever viruses, the pathogenesis of Crimean -Congo hemorrhagic fever and causes of death were not well described. We aimed to evaluate whether there were electrocardiographic parameters designating mortality among these patients. STUDY DESIGN This retrospective study was performed among confirmed Crimean -Congo hemorrhagic fever cases in Turkey. Electrocardiography was available in 49 patients within 24 h of hospitalization. All electrocardiograms were evaluated by two expert cardiologists according to Minnesota coding system. RESULTS Among patients with available electrocardiograms, there were 31 patients who survived, and 18 patients who died of Crimean - Congo hemorrhagic fever. Both groups were similar in terms of age, sex, body temperature, heart rate, and blood parameters. T-wave changes and bundle branch block were more frequently encountered among those who died. Presence of T-wave negativity or bundle branch block in this cohort of patients with Crimean -Congo hemorrhagic fever predicted death with a sensitivity of 72.7%, specificity of 92.6%, positive predictive value of 88.9%, negative predictive value of 80.6%. CONCLUSIONS We think within the light of our findings that simple electrocardiography at admission may help risk stratification among Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever cases.","Yilmaz, Mehmet Birhan; Engin, Aynur; Bektasoglu, Gokhan; Zorlu, Ali; Ege, Meltem Refiker; Bakir, Mehmet; Dokmetas, Ilyas",Journal of vector borne diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21946714/,824

224875,Variability in instructions for performance of nasopharyngeal swabs across Canada in the era of COVID-19 - what type of swab is actually being performed?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing is a crucial strategy for HIV prevention. HIV testing rates remain low among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China. Digital network-based secondary distribution is considered as an effective model to enhance HIV self-testing (HIVST) among key populations. Digital platforms provide opportunities for testers to apply for HIVST kits by themselves, and secondary distribution allows them to apply for multiple kits to deliver to their sexual partners or members within their social network. We describe a three-arm randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of monetary incentives and peer referral in promoting digital network-based secondary distribution of HIVST among MSM in China. METHODS: Three hundred MSM in China will be enrolled through a digital platform for data collection. The eligibility criteria include being biological male, 18 years of age or over, ever having had sex with another man, being able to apply for kits via the online platform, and being willing to provide personal telephone number for follow-up. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated into one of the three arms: standard secondary distribution arm, secondary distribution with monetary incentives arm, and secondary distribution with monetary incentives plus peer referral arm. Participants (defined as ""index"") will distribute actual HIV self-test kits to members within their social network (defined as ""alter"") or share referral links to encourage alters to apply HIV self-test kits by themselves. All index participants will be requested to complete a baseline survey and a 3-month follow-up survey. Both indexes and alters will complete a survey upon returning the results by taking a photo of the used kits with the unique identification number. DISCUSSION: HIV testing rates remain suboptimal among MSM in China. Innovative interventions are needed to further expand the uptake of HIV testing among key populations. The findings of the trial can provide scientific evidence and experience on promoting secondary distribution of HIVST to reach key populations who have not yet been covered by existing testing services. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR1900025433) on 26, August 2019, http://www.chictr.org.cn/showproj.aspx?proj=42001.

234846,[Management of emergency department inflows during the COVID-19 outbreak in the CHU of Liege : efficiency of an advanced triage center],2020,"BACKGROUND: Despite the introduction of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and legislations, many websites remain poorly accessible to users with disability, especially those with visual impairment, as the internet has become a more visually complex environment. With increasing reliance on the internet and almost 2 million people in the United Kingdom being affected by vision loss, it is important that they are not overlooked when developing web-based materials. A significant proportion of those affected have irreversible vision loss due to rare genetic eye disorders, and many of them use the internet as a primary source of information for their conditions. However, access to high-quality web-based health information with an inclusive design remains a challenge for many. We have developed a new web-based resource for genetic eye disorders called Gene.Vision thataims to provide a holistic guide for patients, relatives, and health care professionals. OBJECTIVE: Through a usability testing session of our website prototype, this study aims to identify key web-based accessibility features for internet users with vision impairment and to explore whether the contents provided in Gene.Vision are relevant and comprehensible. METHODS: A face-to-face testing session with 8 participants (5 patients, 2 family members, and 1 member of the public) and 8 facilitators was conducted on a prototype website. Remote testing was performed with another patient due to COVID-19 restrictions. Home page design, navigation, content layout and quality, language, and readability were explored through direct observation and task completion using the think-aloud method. A patient focus group was organized to elicit further feedback. Qualitative data were gathered and analyzed to identify core themes through open and axial coding. RESULTS: All participants had good computer literacy; 6 patients with visual impairment used visual aid software including iOS VoiceOver and Speak Screen, iOS Classic Invert, ZoomText 2020, Job Access With Speech, and Nonvisual Desktop Access. The features identified by the participants that will enhance accessibility and usability for users with visual impairment were a consistent website layout, a structured information hierarchy with a clear description of links, good chromatic and luminance contrast, a simple home page with predictable and easy navigation, adaptability to various assistive software, and readable and relevant content. They reported that dynamic content (such as carousels) and large empty spaces reduced accessibility. Information on research, support available, practical advice, and links to charities were incentives for repeated website visits. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the importance of developing a website with a user-based approach. Through end user testing, we identified several key web-based accessibility features for people with visual impairment. Target end users should always be involved early and throughout the design process to ensure their needs are met. Many of these steps can be implemented easily and will aid in search engine optimization.","Yeong, Jian Lee; Thomas, Peter; Buller, James; Moosajee, Mariya",J Med Internet Res,,824

Although World Health Organization (WHO) has not recommended any effective treatments for COVID-19, there are some reports about use of antiviral drugs. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of Arbidol (ARB) on COVID-19 disease. METHODS: Using an open-label randomized controlled trial, we examined the efficacy of ARB in patients with COVID-19 in a teaching hospital. One hundred eligible patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 were recruited in the study and assigned randomly to two groups of either hydroxychloroquine followed by KALETRA (Lopinavir/ritonavir) or hydroxychloroquine followed by ARB. The primary outcome was hospitalization duration and clinical improvement 7 days after admission. The criteria of improvement were relief of cough, dyspnea, and fever. Time to relief from fever was also assessed across the two groups. Without any dropouts, 100 patients were entered into the study for the final analysis at significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 56.6 (17.8) years and 56.2 (14.8) years in ARB and KALETRA groups, respectively. Majority of patients were male across two groups (66 and 54%). The duration of hospitalization in ARB group was significantly less than KALETRA arm (7.2 versus 9.6 days; P = 0.02). Time to relief fever was almost similar across two groups (2.7 versus 3.1 days in ARB and KALETRA arms, respectively). Peripheral oxygen saturation rate was significantly different after 7 days of admission across two groups (94% versus 92% in ARB and KALETRA groups respectively) (P = 0.02). Based on multiple linear regression analysis, IHD, Na level, and oxygen saturation at the time of admission and type of therapy were the independent adjusted variables that determined the duration of hospitalization in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that Arbidol, compared to KALETRA, significantly contributes to clinical and laboratory improvements, including peripheral oxygen saturation, requiring ICU admissions, duration of hospitalization, chest CT involvements, WBC, and ESR. We suggest further studies on ARB against COVID-19 using larger sample size and multicenter design.

After ruling out COVID-19 infection, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation was confirmed and he was thus transferred to the nephrology division. Physical examination and blood tests revealed a positive fluid balance and insufficient correction of the uraemic syndrome, although peritoneal dialysis prescription was maximised. After discussion with the patient and his family, the staff decided to start hybrid dialysis, consisting of once-weekly in-hospital haemodialysis and home peritoneal dialysis for the remaining days. He was discharged at the end of the antibiotic course, after an internal jugular vein central venous catheter placement and the first haemodialysis session. This strategy allowed improvement of depuration parameters and avoidance of frequent access to the hospital, which is crucial in limiting exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in an endemic setting.","Mori, Giacomo; Alfano, Gaetano; Fontana, Francesco; Magistroni, Riccardo",BMJ case reports,,824

403899,Tele Otology in India: Last 10 Years-A Scopic Review,2021,"BACKGROUND: Several countries have released digital proximity tracing (DPT) apps to complement manual contact tracing (MCT) for combatting the Sars-CoV-2 pandemic. DPT aims to notify app users about proximity exposures to persons infected with Sars-CoV-2 so that they can self-quarantine. The success of DPT apps depends on user acceptance and DPT embedding into the pandemic mitigation strategy. OBJECTIVE: By searching for media articles published during the first three months after DPT launch, the implementation of DPT in Switzerland was evaluated to inform similar undertakings in other countries. The second aim was to create a link between reported DPT implementation challenges with normalization process theory (NPT) for planning and optimizing complex digital health interventions, which can provide useful guidance for decision-making of DPT design and implementation. METHODS: A Swiss media database was searched for articles on the Swiss DPT app (SwissCovid) published in German or French between 04.07.2020 and 03.10.2020. Topics were extracted and clustered manually from articles that were deemed pertinent in a structured process. Extracted topics were mapped to four NPT constructs, which reflect the flow of intervention development from planning, stakeholder onboarding, and execution to critical appraisal. Coherence constructs describe sense-making by stakeholders, cognitive participation constructs reflect participants' efforts to create engagement with the intervention, collective actions refer to intervention execution and joint stakeholder efforts to make it work, and reflexive monitoring refers to collective risk-benefit appraisals to create improvements. RESULTS: Out of 94 articles deemed pertinent and selected for closer inspection, 38 provided unique information on implementation challenges. Five challenge areas were identified: communication challenges, challenges for DPT to interface with other processes, fear of resource competition with established pandemic mitigation measures, unclear DPT effectiveness, and obstacles for greater user coverage and compliance. Specifically, several articles mentioned unclear DPT benefits to affect commitment and to raise fears among different health system actors regarding resource competition. Moreover, media reports indicated process interface challenges such as delays or unclear responsibilities in the notification cascade, as well as misunderstandings and unmet communication needs from health system actors (including physicians, cantonal health authorities). Finally, reports suggested misaligned incentives, not only for app usage by the public but also for process engagement by other actors in the app notification cascade. These challenges mapped well to the four constructs of NPT, thus providing a framework to contextualize the different DPT implementation challenges and to highlight improvement strategies, namely a better alignment of stakeholder incentives, or stakeholder-specfic communication to address their concerns about DPT. CONCLUSIONS: Early experiences from one of the first adopters of DPT indicate that non-technical implementation challenges may affect DPT-effectiveness. The NPT analysis provides a novel perspective on DPT-implementation and stresses the need for stakeholder inclusion in development and operationalization.","von Wyl, Viktor",,,824

The ever-growing genome editing toolbox includes an assortment of CRISPR-Cas systems with increasing efficiency, precision, flexibility, and targeting capacity. Over the past decade, the advent of large-scale genotyping technologies and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has provided numerous genotype-phenotype associations for diseases with complex traits. Notably, a growing number of loss-of-function mutations have been associated with favorable CVD risk-factor profiles that may confer protection. Combining the newly gained insights of human genetics with recent breakthrough technologies, such as the CRISPR-Cas9 technologies, holds great promise in elucidating novel disease mechanisms and transforming genes into medicines. Nonetheless, translating genetic insights into novel therapeuties remains challenging.

As the US population shifts to practice social distancing, there are undoubtedly changes in the pattern of traumatic injuries presenting to Emergency Departments across the US. This analysis aims to analyze previously undocumented trends on how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the pattern of vehicle related injuries in selected US states. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed utilizing public vehicle collision data gathered from the Department of Transportation of Florida, New York, and Massachusetts from October 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020 regarding 158,341 motor vehicle collisions. Descriptive statistical analysis and linear regression was performed to investigate the counts and trends of motor vehicle collisions and injuries during the study period in order to determine what effect, if any, COVID-19 has had on the incidence and pattern of these events. RESULTS: In Florida, New York, and Massachusetts, there was a general downward trend of vehicle collisions and vehicle related injuries over this time period, with statistically significant association between number of total vehicle collisions vs. date (pâ¯<â¯0.001), as well as number of vehicle related injuries vs. date (pâ¯<â¯0.001).

664958,Safety Guidelines for Sterility of Face Shields During COVID 19 Pandemic,2020-04-30,"[Image: see text] Identifying the fundamental cause of transmissibility of multiple mutation strains and vaccine nullification is difficult in general and is a source of significant concern. The conformational variability of the mutation sites for B.1.617.2 (Δ), B.1.617.1 (κ), B.1.427/429 (ε), P.1 (γ), B.1.351 (β), B.1.1.7 (α), S477N, and the wild-type strain has been assessed using a deep neural-network-based prediction program of conformational flexibility or rigidity in proteins (SSSCPreds). We find that although the conformation of G614 is rigid, which is assigned as a left-handed (LH) α-helix-type one, that of D614 is flexible without the hydrogen bonding latch to T859. The rigidity of glycine, which stabilizes the local conformation more effectively than that of aspartic acid with the latch, thereby contributes to the reduction of S1 shedding, high expression, and increase in infectivity. The finding that the sequence flexibility/rigidity map pattern of B.1.1.7 is similar to that of the wild-type strain but is largely different from those of B.1.351 and P.1 correlates with the minor escape ability of B.1.1.7. The increased rigidity of the amino acid sequence YRYRLFR from the SSSCPreds data of B.1.427/429 near the L452R mutation site contributes to the 2-fold increased B.1.427/B.1.429 viral shedding in vivo and the increase in transmissibility relative to wild-type circulating strains in a similar manner to D614G. The concordance and rigidity ratios of multiple mutation strains such as B.1.617.2 against the wild-type one at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and receptor-binding motif (RBM) regions provide a good indication of the transmissibility and neutralization escape ability except for binding affinity of mutation sites such as N501Y.","Izumi, Hiroshi; Nafie, Laurence A.; Dukor, Rina K.",ACS Omega,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.1c03055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34337269/,824

However, significant variations are observed in following the policy across individuals and countries. Arguably, differences in citizens’ adherence actions will be influenced by their perceptions about government’s plans and the information available to guide their behaviors—more so in the digital age in the realm of mass influence of social media on citizens. Insights into the underlying factors and dynamics involved with citizens’ adherence process will inform the policy makers to follow appropriate communication and messaging approaches to influence citizens’ willingness to adhere to the recommendations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is a comparative evaluation of citizens’ adherence process to COVID-19–relevant recommendations by the government. The focus is on how three different countries’ (United States, Kuwait, and South Korea) citizens, randomly sampled, respond to governments’ pandemic guidance efforts. We draw insights into two categories of perceived government roles in managing the pandemic: (1) citizens’ perceptions of government’s role in responding to the pandemic and (2) citizens’ perceptions of government’s business reopening efforts. Undoubtedly, the internet and social media have burgeoned, with differing effects on shaping individuals’ views and assessments of the COVID-19 situation; we argue and test for the effects of information sources, social media use, and knowledge on the adherence actions. METHODS: We randomly sampled web-based survey data collected by a global firm in May 2020 from citizens of the United States, Kuwait, and South Korea. A nonlinear ordered probit regression, controlling for several counterfactuals, was used for analysis. The focal estimated effects of the study were compared across countries using the weighted distance between the parameter estimates. RESULTS: The total sample size was 482 respondents, of which 207 (43%) lived in the United States, 181 (38%) lived in Kuwait, and 94 (20%) lived in South Korea. The ordered probit estimation results suggest that overall, perception of government response efforts positively influenced self-adherence (P<.001) and others’ adherence (P<.001) to social distancing and sheltering. Perception of government business reopening efforts positively influenced others’ adherence (P<.001). A higher intensity of general health information source for COVID-19 had a positive effect on self-adherence (P=.003). A higher intensity of social media source use for COVID-19 positively influenced others’ adherence (P=.002). A higher intensity of knowledge on COVID-19 positively influenced self-adherence (P=.008) and negatively influenced others’ adherence (P<.001). There were country-level variations—broadly, the United States and Kuwait had better effects than South Korea. CONCLUSIONS: As the COVID-19 global pandemic continues to grow and governmental restrictions are ongoing, it is critical to understand people’s frustration to reduce panic and promote social distancing to facilitate the control of the pandemic. This study finds that the government plays a central role in terms of adherence to restrictions. Governments need to enhance their efforts on publicizing information on the pandemic, as well as employ strategies for improved communication management to citizens through social media as well as mainstream information sources.","Al-Hasan, Abrar; Yim, Dobin; Khuntia, Jiban",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/20634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32716896/,824
676461,Variability in instructions for performance of nasopharyngeal swabs across Canada in the era of COVID-19 – what type of swab is actually being performed?,2021-01-28,"Vaccination is arguably the most cost-effective preventative measure against infectious diseases. While vaccines have been successfully developed against certain viruses (e.g., yellow fever virus, polio virus, and human papilloma virus HPV), those against a number of other important public health threats, such as HIV-1, hepatitis C, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), have so far had very limited success. The global pandemic of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, highlights the urgency of vaccine development against this and other constant threats of zoonotic infection. While some traditional methods of producing vaccines have proven to be successful, new concepts have emerged in recent years to produce more cost-effective and less time-consuming vaccines that rely on viral vectors to deliver the desired immunogens. This review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of different viral vaccine vectors and their general strategies and applications in both human and veterinary medicines. A careful review of these issues is necessary as they can provide important insights into how some of these viral vaccine vectors can induce robust and long-lasting immune responses in order to provide protective efficacy against a variety of infectious disease threats to humans and animals, including those with zoonotic potential to cause global pandemics.","Vrba, Sophia M.; Kirk, Natalie M.; Brisse, Morgan E.; Liang, Yuying; Ly, Hinh",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33202961/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040680,824
