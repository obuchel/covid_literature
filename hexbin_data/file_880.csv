The aim of this study was to investigate how many patients ended up with a ureteral stricture after URS at our hospital and how these were treated. We also wanted to identify potential risk factors for post endoscopic stricture formation. Materials and methods: A retrospective evaluation of 1001 URS for stone treatment at the day-case surgery unit between 2013 - 2018 was performed. Data on pretreatment status, the surgical procedure and follow-up were recorded. Exact χ2 and independent-samples t-tests were used comparing data among those who developed strictures and those who did not. Multiple logistic regression was performed analyzing risk factors for stricture formation. Results: In total, 1001 URS were performed in 725 patients, 289 women and 436 men. Of these, 995 cases were eligible for analysis. At follow-up with computed tomography after 3 months, 28 (3.0%) strictures were identified. Of these, 20 received endourological treatment with balloon dilatation of which 15 (75%) were successful. Definitive treatment in the 13 patients with failed or unattempted endourological treatment included nephrectomy, reconstructive surgery, permanent nephrostomy or observation with no further treatment. In multiple regression analysis, use of access sheath (UAS) (OR 4.6, p = 0.011), ureteral perforation (OR 11.8, p < 0.0001) and surgical time > 60 minutes (OR 5.7, p < 0.005) were found to be risk factors for stricture formation. Conclusion: Ureteral stricture is a rare complication of URS. Balloon dilatation should be the first line of treatment. Use of UAS, perforation and excessive operating time were found to be risk factors for post endoscopic ureteral stricture formation. Special attention to these risk factors should be given to reduce the incidence of ureteral strictures.","Ulvik, Øyvind; Harneshaug, Jill-Randi; Gjengstø, Peder",Journal of endourology,880,1

In the present study, we explored the interaction between ET-1 and the RAS by examining the effect of ET-1 on angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) expression and activity in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs). METHODS HBEpCs were treated with ET-1 (1, 10, 20, 40 or 50 nmol/l) for 6, 12, 18, 24 or 30 h with or without the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, endothelin A (ETA) receptor blocker BQ123, endothelin B receptor blocker BQ788, or different kinase inhibitors. RESULTS ET-1 decreased the ACE2 mRNA level in a dose- and time-dependent manner within 24 h, which led to dose-dependent downregulation of the ACE2 promoter activity, protein level and the cell membrane ACE2 activity. Actinomycin D (1 mg/ml), BQ123 (1 μmol/l), and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) siRNA and inhibitor PD169316 (25 μmol/l) completely abolished the effect of ET-1 on ACE2 expression in HBEpCs. CONCLUSION ET-1 downregulates ACE2 expression and activity at the transcription level in HBEpCs via the ETA receptor by a p38 MAPK-dependent mechanism. This is the first evidence of crosstalk between the ET-1/ETA axis and the RAS in regard to the pathogenesis and progression of COPD.","Zhang, Hongliang; Li, Yamin; Zeng, Yan; Wu, Renrong; Ou, Jianjun",Pharmacology,880,17

OBJECTIVE To compare the initial failure and recurrence rates of primary treatment of SDAVFs by surgery and endovascular techniques. METHODS A meta-analysis using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) standard was performed. All the English literature from 2004 onward was evaluated. From each article that compared the 2 treatment modalities, the odds ratio (OR) was calculated. Combined ORs were calculated with Review Manager 5.3 of The Cochrane Collaboration. RESULTS A total of 35 studies harboring 1112 patients were assessed. Initial definitive fistula occlusion was observed in 588 of 609 surgical patients (96.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 94.8-97.8) vs 363 of 503 endovascularly treated patients (72.2%; 95% CI, 68.1-75.9; P < .001). The combined OR from 18 studies that assessed both treatment modalities (730 patients) was 6.15 (95% CI, 3.45-11.0) in favor of surgical treatment. Late recurrence (13 studies, 480 patients) revealed an OR of 3.15 (95% CI, 1.66-5.96; P < .001) in favor of surgery. In a subgroup, recurrence was reported in 10 of 22 patients (45%) treated with Onyx vs 8 of 35 (23%) treated with n-butyle-2-cyanoacrylate (OR, 2.51; 95% CI, 0.75-8.37; P = .13). CONCLUSION Although hampered by inclusion of poor quality studies, this meta-analysis shows a definite advantage of primary surgical treatment of SDAVF over endovascular treatment in initial failure rate and late recurrences. The often-used argument that endovascular techniques have improved and therefore outweigh surgery is not supported by this meta-analysis.","Bakker, Nicolaas A; Uyttenboogaart, Maarten; Luijckx, G J; Eshghi, Omid S; Mazuri, Aryan; Metzemaekers, Jan D M; Groen, Rob J M; Van Dijk, J Marc C",Neurosurgery,880,1

In case of enveloped viruses, their interaction with the host cell receptor is mediated by viral encoded glycoproteins on its envelope, a host derived lipid bilayer. Since, virus entry is a multistep process, after receptor recognition, envelope proteins mediate internalisation of virus particles into the host cell. Envelope glycoproteins are the first proteins that the host immune system encounters upon infection. Thus, envelope proteins are important drug target with multiple strategies to inhibit entry of the virus into the host. Currently, there very few drugs that function as envelope protein inhibitors which are approved for human use. Here, we reviewed different classes of envelop proteins of various viruses and emphasized the use of small molecules to inhibit fusion of envelope proteins. Based on the available information in the literature, envelope proteins can be important drug targets and small molecules inhibitors can serve as potential antiviral drugs to block viral infection at an initial stage.","Verma, Jyoti; Subbarao, Naidu; Rajala, Maitreyi S",Journal of drug targeting,880,31

DESIGN We used Data Envelopment Analysis to benchmark diets for improved adherence to food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG). We then optimised these diets for dietary preferences, nutrient quality and environmental impact. Diets were evaluated using the Nutrient Rich Diet score (NRD15.3), diet-related greenhouse gas emission (GHGE) and a diet similarity index that quantified the proportion of food intake that remained similar as compared with the observed diet. SETTING National dietary surveys of four European countries (Denmark, Czech Republic, Italy and France). SUBJECTS Approximately 6500 adults, aged 18-64 years. RESULTS When dietary preferences were prioritised, NRD15·3 was ~6 % higher, GHGE was ~4 % lower and ~85 % of food intake remained similar. This diet had higher amounts of fruit, vegetables and whole grains than the observed diet. When nutrient quality was prioritised, NRD15·3 was ~16 % higher, GHGE was ~3 % lower and ~72 % of food intake remained similar. This diet had higher amounts of legumes and fish and lower amounts of sweetened and alcoholic beverages. Finally, when environmental impact was prioritised, NRD15·3 was ~9 % higher, GHGE was ~21 % lower and ~73 % of food intake remained similar. In this diet, red and processed meat partly shifted to either eggs, poultry, fish or dairy. CONCLUSIONS Benchmark modelling can generate diets with improved adherence to FBDG within the boundaries of dietary practices, but fully maximising health and minimising GHGE cannot be achieved simultaneously.","Mertens, Elly; Kuijsten, Anneleen; Kanellopoulos, Argyris; Dofková, Marcela; Mistura, Lorenza; D'Addezio, Laura; Turrini, Aida; Dubuisson, Carine; Havard, Sabrina; Trolle, Ellen; Eckl, Marion; Biesbroek, Sander; Bloemhof, Jacqueline; Geleijnse, Johanna M; van 't Veer, Pieter",Public health nutrition,880,27

We validated a rapidly applicable, lowcost decontamination protocol in compliance with regulatory standards to enable the safe reuse of N95 respirators. METHODS We inoculated 4 common models of N95 respirators with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and evaluated viral inactivation after disinfection for 60 minutes at 70°C and 0% relative humidity. Similarly, we evaluated thermal disinfection at 0% to 70% relative humidity for masks inoculated with Escherichia coli. We assessed masks subjected to multiple cycles of thermal disinfection for structural integrity using scanning electron microscopy and for protective functions using standards of the United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for particle filtration efficiency, breathing resistance and respirator fit. RESULTS A single heat treatment rendered SARS-CoV-2 undetectable in all mask samples. Compared with untreated inoculated control masks, E. coli cultures at 24 hours were virtually undetectable from masks treated at 70°C and 50% relative humidity (optical density at 600 nm wavelength, 0.02 ± 0.02 v. 2.77 ± 0.09, p < 0.001), but contamination persisted for masks treated at lower relative humidity. After 10 disinfection cycles, masks maintained fibre diameters similar to untreated masks and continued to meet standards for fit, filtration efficiency and breathing resistance.

PROGRAM The Los Angeles County (LAC) Department of Public Health (DPH), Hospital Outreach Unit (HOU) addressed this need with the liaison public health nurse (LPHN) project, which is designed to strengthen capacity and bridge the care continuum with hospitals to prevent/control infectious disease. IMPLEMENTATION The project utilizes 5 LPHNs who interface with LAC hospitals to improve reporting of infectious disease/hospital outbreaks, strengthen the surveillance infrastructure, and enhance communication/collaboration. The LPHNs communicate regularly and meet one-on-one with hospital infection preventionists with focused discussion, consultation, and assessment of infectious disease, participate in joint infection control meetings/conferences/calls, outreach on joint public health projects, and educate/train hospital staff. EVALUATION Within the first 7 years of implementation (2003) of the unit, reporting of hospital outbreaks increased 27%; hospitals reporting infectious disease via a county reporting system increased 95% during the same period. Currently, 64% of hospitals are reporting via the electronic laboratory reporting system (automated transmission to public health of reportable laboratory findings). In addition, the number of hospital infection control committee meetings LPHNs were invited to increased 96% during the first 7 years. The LPHNs/HOU participate(d) in 9 joint infection prevention/control projects with hospitals. DISCUSSION The threat of emerging infectious disease, health care-associated infections, and multidrug-resistant organisms is an ongoing challenge.

Previously, we established that hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria (HOB) have the ability to remove orthophosphate from artificial surface water. In the present study, we expand the application of the HOB orthophosphate removal strategy (1) to treat artificial surface water with low initial orthophosphate concentrations, (2) to treat real surface water and real wastewater effluent, and (3) to remove orthophosphate continuously. For synthetic surface water, irrespective of the initial concentration of 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, and 0.1 mg PO43--P/L, ultra-low concentrations (0.0058 ± 0.0028 mg PO43--P/L) were obtained. When artificial surface water was replaced by real surface water, without added nutrients or other chemicals, it was shown that over 90% orthophosphate could be removed within 30 min of operation in a batch configuration (0.031 ± 0.023 mg PO43--P/L). In continuous operation, orthophosphate removal from surface water left an average concentration of 0.040 ± 0.036 for 60 days, and the lowest orthophosphate concentration measured was 0.013 mg PO43-/L. Simultaneously, nitrate was continuously removed for 60 days below 0.1 mg/L. The ability to remove orthophosphate even under nitrogen limiting conditions might be related to the ability of HOB to fix nitrogen.

Even though causality has not yet been established, intestinal dysbiosis has emerged as a hallmark of several diseases, including neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs). The fact that the microbiota and central nervous system are co-developing during the first years of life has provided a paradigm suggesting a potential role of psychobiotics for earlier interventions. Studies in animal models of early-life stress (ELS) have shown that they can counteract the pervasive effects of stress during this crucial developmental period, and rescue behavioral symptoms related to anxiety and depression later in life. In humans, evidence from clinical studies on the efficacy of psychobiotics at improving mental outcomes in most NPDs remain limited, except for major depressive disorder for which more studies are available. Consequently, the beneficial effect of psychobiotics on depression-related outcomes in adults are becoming clearer. While the specific mechanisms at play remain elusive, the effect of psychobiotics are generally considered to involve the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, intestinal permeability, and inflammation. It is anticipated that future clinical studies will explore the potential role of psychobiotics at mitigating the risk developing NPDs in vulnerable individuals or in the context of childhood adversity. However, such studies remain challenging at present in terms of design and target populations; the profound impact of stress on the proper development of the MGBA during the first year of life is becoming increasingly recognized, but the trajectories post-ELS in humans and the mechanisms by which stress affects the susceptibility to various NPDs are still ill-defined. As psychobiotics are likely to exert both shared and specific mechanisms, a better definition of target subpopulations would allow to tailor psychobiotics selection by aligning mechanistic properties with known pathophysiological mechanisms or risk factors. Here we review the available evidence from clinical and preclinical studies supporting a role for psychobiotics at ameliorating depression-related outcomes, highlighting the knowledge gaps and challenges associated with conducting longitudinal studies to address outstanding key questions in the field.","Tremblay, Annie; Lingrand, Lucie; Maillard, Morgane; Feuz, Berengere; Tompkins, Thomas A",Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,880,1

DESIGN Cross-sectional study. SETTING Community-dwelling men recruited from 2000 to 2002 from six U.S. academic centers for the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study. PARTICIPANTS A total of 5,979 men aged 65 and older. MEASUREMENTS The independent variable was LUTS severity (none/mild, moderate, or severe) assessed with the American Urologic Association Symptom Index. Participants were categorized as frail, intermediate stage, or robust using an adapted Cardiovascular Health Study index (components: low lean mass, weakness, exhaustion, slowness, and low physical activity). Associations were estimated with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from multivariable multinomial logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders of age, other demographics, health-related behaviors, and comorbidities. RESULTS The prevalence of frailty was 7%, 11%, and 18% among men with none/mild, moderate, and severe LUTS, respectively. Moderate and severe LUTS, overall and by storage and voiding subscores, were associated with higher odds of both intermediate stage and frailty in all models. After adjustment for confounders, the odds of frailty was 1.41 times higher among men with moderate LUTS (95% CI = 1.14-1.74) and 2.51 times higher among men with severe LUTS (95% CI = 1.76-3.55), compared with none/mild LUTS. Severe LUTS was associated with a greater odds of individual frailty components exhaustion and low physical activity. CONCLUSION The prevalence of phenotypic frailty is higher among older community-dwelling men with moderate or severe LUTS compared with those with mild or no LUTS. The positive association between LUTS severity and frailty among older men appears independent of age and known frailty risk factors. Although the temporal direction of this association and the utility of LUTS or frailty interventions in this population remain unclear, the high co-occurrence of these conditions could lead to earlier identification of frailty when clinically appropriate.","Bauer, Scott R; Scherzer, Rebecca; Suskind, Anne M; Cawthon, Peggy; Ensrud, Kristine E; Ricke, William A; Covinsky, Kenneth; Marshall, Lynn M",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,880,1

BACKGROUND Many nursing homes in Germany provide Dementia Special Care Units. Existing definitions often do no justice to the complexity of their context. In this study, we define context as structural and organizational variables. It is necessary to define an empirical based set of indicators to characterize care units with respect to dementia care. DESIGN Observational survey study with a cross-sectional design. METHODS We will use a stratified random nationwide sample of 160 German nursing homes. Stratification variables are federal state and the existence of a Dementia Special Care Unit. The sampling frame from which the participating nursing homes are selected is a list with the total population of German nursing homes (n = 11.658). Data will be gathered on the level of the nursing homes and one of their care units via computer-assisted telephone interviews with a standardized questionnaire. The distribution of the assessed variables (contextual characteristics) will be described in absolute and relative frequencies for the whole sample in the first step in order to describe dementia-specific care structures. In the second step, factor analysis of mixed data (FAMD) with hierarchical clustering (HC) will be applied to analyze relationships between variables. The study was ethically approved in October 2018. DISCUSSION The typology can be used in future studies to define the context of care units in nursing homes. This may improve the interpretation of findings from future studies that investigated interventions in nursing homes.

We investigated the cause of illness, transmission, and recommended control. We defined a suspected case of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) as acute onset of fever (≥38°C) with sore throat or cough and at least one of the following: headache, lethargy, or difficulty in breathing. In addition, we looked at cases with onset between February 1 and March 31 in a person with a history of contact with Mr. A, his family, or other Company A employees. A confirmed case was defined as a suspected case with laboratory confirmation of the same pathogen detected in Mr. A. Influenza-like illness was defined as onset of fever (≥38°C) and cough or sore throat in a Uganda contact, and as fever (≥38°C) and cough lasting less than 10 days in a Kenya contact. We collected Mr. A's exposure and clinical history, searched for cases, and traced contacts.

With the prevalence of Internet access, more and more researchers today are using data from both search engines and social media to improve the prediction accuracy. In particular, a prediction market system (PMS) exploits the wisdom of crowds on the Internet to effectively accomplish relatively high accuracy. OBJECTIVE This study presents the architecture of a PMS and demonstrates the matching mechanism of logarithmic market scoring rules. The system was implemented to predict infectious diseases in Taiwan with the wisdom of crowds in order to improve the accuracy of epidemic forecasting. METHODS The PMS architecture contains three design components: database clusters, market engine, and Web applications. The system accumulated knowledge from 126 health professionals for 31 weeks to predict five disease indicators: the confirmed cases of dengue fever, the confirmed cases of severe and complicated influenza, the rate of enterovirus infections, the rate of influenza-like illnesses, and the confirmed cases of severe and complicated enterovirus infection. RESULTS Based on the winning ratio, the PMS predicts the trends of three out of five disease indicators more accurately than does the existing system that uses the five-year average values of historical data for the same weeks. In addition, the PMS with the matching mechanism of logarithmic market scoring rules is easy to understand for health professionals and applicable to predict all the five disease indicators. CONCLUSIONS The PMS architecture of this study affords organizations and individuals to implement it for various purposes in our society. The system can continuously update the data and improve prediction accuracy in monitoring and forecasting the trends of epidemic diseases. Future researchers could replicate and apply the PMS demonstrated in this study to more infectious diseases and wider geographical areas, especially the under-developed countries across Asia and Africa.","Li, Eldon Y; Tung, Chen-Yuan; Chang, Shu-Hsun",International journal of medical informatics,880,27

Regardless of what species serve as host or vectors, and of the geographic distribution and the mechanisms of replication, arboviruses tend to have slow evolutionary rates in nature. The hypothesis that this is the result of replication in the disparate environments provided by host and vector did not receive solid experimental support in any of the many viral species tested. Instead, it seems that from the virus's point of view, either the two environments are sufficiently similar or one of the environments so dominates viral evolution that there is tolerance for suboptimal adaptation to the other environment. Replication in alternating environments has an unexpected cost in that there is decreased genetic variance that translates into a compromised adaptability for bypassed environments. Arboviruses under strong and continuous positive selection may have unusual patterns of genomic changes, with few or no mutations accumulated in the consensus sequence or with dN/dS values typically consistent with random drift in DNA-based organisms.","Novella, Isabel S; Presloid, John B; Smith, Sarah D; Wilke, Claus O",Journal of molecular microbiology and biotechnology,880,16

A hsPDA decreases cerebral blood flow and oxygen saturation by the ductal steal phenomenon. AIM To determine the relationship between echocardiographic parameters, cerebral oxygenation and a hsPDA in preterm infants. METHODS 380 preterm infants (<32 weeks gestational age) born between 2008 and 2010 were included. Blinded echocardiographic examination was performed on the second, fourth and sixth day after birth. Examinations were deblinded when hsPDA was clinically suspected. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) was continuously monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy during 72 h after birth, and afterwards for at least 1 h before echocardiography. Echocardiographic parameters included ductal diameter, end-diastolic flow in the left pulmonary artery, left atrium/aorta ratio and ductal flow pattern. RESULTS rScO2 was significantly related only to ductal diameter over time. Mixed modelling analysed the course of rScO2 over time, where infants were divided into four groups: a closed duct, an open haemodynamically insignificant duct (non-sPDA), a hsPDA, which was successfully closed during study period (SC hsPDA) or a hsPDA, which was unsuccessfully closed during study period (UC hsPDA). SC hsPDA infants showed the highest rScO2 on day 6, while UC hsPDA infants had the lowest rScO2 values. CONCLUSIONS Ductal diameter is the only echocardiographic parameter significantly related to cerebral oxygenation over time. Cerebral oxygenation takes a different course over time depending on the status of the duct. Low cerebral oxygenation may be suggestive of a hsPDA.","Dix, Laura; Molenschot, Mirella; Breur, Johannes; de Vries, Willem; Vijlbrief, Daniel; Groenendaal, Floris; van Bel, Frank; Lemmers, Petra",Archives of disease in childhood.

Elderly population, due to various reasons such as low immunity, pre-existing co-morbidities such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases or diabetes, are obviously predisposed to develop severe infections and exhibit a high mortality rate. This is because of many reasons which include the atypical presentation in the geriatric population which might have led to diagnostic delay. As per the WHO guidelines to perform RT-PCR only on the symptomatic individuals, a very small portion of individuals were tested, leaving a fraction of population undiagnosed. Therefore, there remained a chance that many asymptomatic individuals such caregivers, healthcare professionals, family members were undiagnosed and might have carried this virus to the geriatric patients. Also, many countries were not prepared to handle the burden on their healthcare system which included sudden increased demand of ICU beds, mechanical ventilation etc. As a result, they had to make decision on who to be admitted. Atypical presentation in geriatric population may include afebrile or low-grade fever, absence of cough, malaise, muscle pains, dyspnoea etc. Geriatric population shows a more severe type of pneumonia, significantly higher number of neutrophils and C-reactive protein, less lymphocytes and a higher proportion of multiple lobe involvement.

When feasible, surgical removal remains the primary treatment strategy; nevertheless, local RCC relapse management is controversial, and less invasive procedures may represent an attractive option to achieve oncologic control. The aim of our study was to assess the feasibility, safety, and clinical outcomes of image-guided percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) for RCC local recurrence in patients initially treated with nephrectomy with curative intent. 10 consecutive patients underwent CT-guided percutaneous MWA of a total of 10 retroperitoneal nodules. Inclusion criteria were: histologically verified retroperitoneal metastases, previous radical nephrectomy, lesion no larger than 3 cm, no other metastatic site elsewhere. All the procedures were performed under moderate sedation choosing the most favorable patient decubitus. If deemed necessary, pneumodissection was induced before ablation. After the antenna placement inside the target lesion, thermal ablation was achieved by maintenance of a power of 100 W for a total time between 2 and 4 min. All patients were observed overnight and discharged the following day if clinically stable. Technical success was obtained in 100% of patients. One patient was re-treated to complete oncologic response with repeat MWA. No major complications were observed. No patients demonstrated local recurrence at a mean follow-up of 26 months. MWA is a safe and effective treatment strategy for loco-regional relapse of RCC following radical nephrectomy. This technique may represent a valuable approach for patients who are not eligible for surgery.","Ierardi, Anna Maria; Carnevale, Aldo; Rossi, Umberto G; Renzulli, Matteo; Garanzini, Enrico; Golfieri, Rita; Macchione, Nicola; Cittanti, Corrado; Giganti, Melchiore; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",Medical oncology,880,7

We utilized statin-treated patients with ASCVD from the AIM-HIGH trial cohort. A 5-year risk score for subsequent ASCVD events with known ASCVD was developed using Cox regression, including potential risk factors with age, sex, and race forced in the model. Internal discrimination and calibration were evaluated.

Genosensors were fabricated on either gold (Au) interdigitated electrodes for electrical and electrochemical measurements or on Au nanoparticles on a glass slide for optical measurements. They contained a matrix of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (11-MUA) self-assembled monolayer (SAM) onto which a layer of capture probe (cpDNA) sequence was immobilized. Detection was performed using electrical and electrochemical impedance spectroscopies and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). The highest sensitivity was reached with impedance spectroscopy, including using a low-cost (US$ 100) homemade impedance analyzer. Complementary ssDNA sequences were detected with a detection limit of 0.5 aM (0.3 copy per mu L). This performance may be attributed to the high sensitivity of the electrical impedance technique combined with an appropriate arrangement of the sequences on the electrodes and hybridization between the complementary sequences, as inferred from polarization-modulated infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS). The selectivity of the genosensor was confirmed by plotting the impedance spectroscopy data with a multidimensional projection technique (interactive document mapping, IDMAP), where a clear separation was observed among the samples of the complementary DNA sequence at various concentrations and from buffer samples containing a non-complementary sequence and other DNA biomarkers. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 mimicking sequences was also achieved with machine learning techniques applied to scanning electron microscope images taken from genosensors exposed to distinct concentrations of the complementary ssDNA sequences. In summary, the genosensors proposed here are promising for detecting SARS-CoV-2 genetic material (RNA) in biological fluids in point-of-care settings.","Soares, J. C.; Soares, A. C.; Rodrigues, V.

To investigate this, we performed a retrospective review of all 1,167 patients from the Mayo Clinic Fontan database. Thirteen percent (153 patients) had AVV repair or replacement during their staged single ventricle palliation. We found that patients with right ventricular morphology and common AVV were at increased risk for AVV intervention. Patients who underwent AVV intervention had increased risk of death/transplant compared to those who did not (hazards ratio (HR)=1.75, 95% CI 1.37-2.23, p<0.001). With respect to valve intervention timing, while AVV intervention prior to Fontan presented similar risk for death/transplant compared to no AVV intervention (HR=0.85, 95% CI 0.32-2.27, p=0.74), intervention at time of Fontan had a significantly higher risk (HR=1.46, 95% CI 1.09-1.97, p=0.01), and intervention after Fontan had a much more substantial risk (HR=3.83, 95% CI 2.54-5.79, p<0.001). AVV repair failure occurred in 11% of patients. In terms of relative risk of valve repair versus replacement, in post-Fontan AVV intervention patients, AVV replacement carried a 2.9 fold risk of death/transplant compared to AVV repair. In conclusion, AVV disease remains a considerable challenge for durable Fontan physiology. This data demonstrates that earlier intervention on valve pathology improves survival with the Fontan circulation. Continued surveillance of single ventricle patients and prompt referral of those with valve pathology can improve outcomes in this challenging population.","Stephens, Elizabeth H; Dearani, Joseph A; Niaz, Talha; Arghami, Arman; Phillips, Sabrina D; Cetta, Frank",,880,5

A safety consideration for the application of chloroquine is its QTc-prolonging potential. Thus far, no data are available on the QTc-prolonging potential of chloroquine in COVID-19 patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the degree of chloroquine-induced QTc prolongation in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and ECGs recorded during chloroquine treatment were retrospectively collected in patients suspected of having COVID-19. The QTc interval was calculated by computerised and manual interpretation. Baseline and follow-up QTc intervals were compared using the paired samples t-test. RESULTS: A total of 95 patients had a baseline ECG recording and at least one ECG recording during chloroquine therapy. Chloroquine treatment resulted in a mean QTc prolongation of 35â¯ms (95% CI 28-43â¯ms) using computerised interpretation and 34â¯ms (95% CI 25-43â¯ms) using manual interpretation. No torsade de pointes was observed during chloroquine treatment. After manual review, 22 patients (23%) had a QTc interval exceeding 500â¯ms during chloroquine treatment. None of these patients had a prolonged QTc interval prior to the initiation of chloroquine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Chloroquine significantly prolongs the QTc interval in a clinically relevant matter. This highlights the need for ECG monitoring when prescribing chloroquine to COVID-19 patients.","van den Broek, M P H; Möhlmann, J E; Abeln, B G S; Liebregts, M; van Dijk, V F; van de Garde, E M W",Neth Heart J,880,16

Patients and Methods: We randomly collected the peripheral blood samples of 11 untreated CLL patients and 10 healthy volunteers, and then separated B lymphocytes from peripheral blood. Then, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western Blot were performed to detect the expression of different cytokines, including CXC-motif chemokine ligand 1 (CXCL-1). Finally, we used flow cytometry to analyze the percentage of surviving cells to figure out whether CLL cells or normal B lymphocytes underwent necroptosis. Results: 1) The high expression of CXCL-1 was seen in CLL cells compared with normal B lymphocytes (p = 0.0001, adjusted p =0.0012); 2) The downregulation of CXCL-1 was shown in normal B lymphocytes after induction by TNF-&#945; and z-VAD; 3) CLL cells could restore necroptosis induced by TNF-&#945; and z-VAD after knockdown of CXCL-1; 4) The transcriptional and translational expression of LEF-1 were downregulated after the knockdown of CXCL-1 in CLL cells; 5. 3.2µM selenite could help CLL cells restore necroptosis (p = 0.0102) and inhibit the transcriptional and translational expression of CXCL-1. Conclusion: CXCL-1 played an important role in the defective necroptosis of CLL cells and regulated the expression of LEF-1. Selenite could inhibit the expression of CXCL-1 and help CLL cells restore necroptosis together with TNF-&#945; and z-VAD. Selenite might be the potential medication of CLL in the future.","Xu, Zhao; Sun, Yifeng; Wei, Zheng; Jiang, Jifeng; Xu, Jiadai; Liu, Peng",Onco Targets Ther,880,16

On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 to officially be a pandemic. The UK was put under lockdown on the 23 March 2020 by the Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the lockdown introduced strict measures put into place including the restriction for unnecessary working from offices, and only leaving houses if it is deemed essential. Therefore, this paper focusses on the changes that the infrastructure sector has had to undertake in order to adhere to the COVID-19 lockdown rules while being productive. Design/methodology/approach: Given the new and unexplored nature of the research problem, a qualitative research methodology was adopted. In total, five semi-structured interviews from three infrastructure sector organisations were conducted to collect data, which was then analysed using thematic analysis for inference and conclusion. Findings: The results indicate that the lockdown is proving to be difficult to manage projects as staff members are working from home. This leads to delays on a project activities as many staff members cannot physically go on site and conduct works. The managers are finding difficult to manage their teams. However, technological tools such as video chat and meetings via online platforms have proven to be most effective in communications with project teams. The Building Information Modelling Design has been useful as the 3D design models helps to visualise the project within team meetings in order to comply with the COVID-19 rules and follow social distancing guidelines while still carrying on works. However, induction to any new starter is proving to be difficult to manage with the pandemic and lockdown as it involves a drugs and alcohol test prior to commencing work of that project. Originality/value: This paper provides a rich insight into the understanding and awareness of the impact of COVID-19 and the changes that the infrastructure sector has had to undertake in order to adhere to the lockdown rules while being productive. This study contributes towards informing policymakers on some lessons learnt from the management of the COVID-19 from an infrastructure sector perspective. Furthermore, 12 key implications are drawn for decision-makers within the infrastructure sector business to rethink and act to deal with the pandemic crisis.","Jallow, Haddy; Renukappa, Suresh; Suresh, Subashini",Smart Sustain.

The results show that the internal carbon emission density and internal energy consumption density of the United States declined during 2010-2014, whereas the internal carbon emission density and internal energy consumption density of developing countries increased. Next, changes in US carbon emissions induced by the epidemic have a more significant impact on Canada, China, Mexico, the European Union, and Russia. Finally, the internal and external carbon emission indexes of most countries have decreased, which indicates that most countries are affected by the carbon reduction and energy consumption caused by the pandemic in the US.

The human users (decision makers) of machine learning methods are often not only interested in getting accurate predictions or projections. Rather, as a decision-maker, the user also needs a convincing answer (or explanation) to the question of why a particular prediction was delivered. Explainable machine learning might be a legal requirement when used for decision making with an immediate effect on the health of human beings. As an example consider the computer vision of a self-driving car whose predictions are used to decide if to stop the car. We have recently proposed an information-theoretic approach to construct personalized explanations for predictions obtained from ML. This method was model-agnostic and only required some training samples of the model to be explained along with a user feedback signal. This paper uses an information-theoretic measure for the quality of an explanation to learn predictors that are intrinsically explainable to a specific user. Our approach is not restricted to a particular hypothesis space, such as linear maps or shallow decision trees, whose predictor maps are considered as explainable by definition. Rather, we regularize an arbitrary hypothesis space using a personalized measure for the explainability of a particular predictor.","Jung, A.",,880,16

ABO blood groups varied significantly between patients and the reference group, with only 38.41% (95% confidence interval [CI], 37.30-39.50) of the patients belonging to blood group O compared with 41.70% (95% CI, 41.60-41.80) in the controls, corresponding to a relative risk of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.83-0.91) for acquiring COVID-19. This study identifies ABO blood group as a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection but not for hospitalization or death from COVID-19.","Barnkob, Mike Bogetofte; Pottegård, Anton; Støvring, Henrik; Haunstrup, Thure Mors; Homburg, Keld; Larsen, Rune; Hansen, Morten Bagge; Titlestad, Kjell; Aagaard, Bitten; Møller, Bjarne Kuno; Barington, Torben",Blood Adv,880,16

Here we report on the development of a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein, expressed in yeast Pichia pastoris. The RBD was modified with addition of flexible N- and C-terminal amino acid extensions aimed to modulate the protein/protein interactions and facilitate protein purification. Fermentation with yeast extract culture medium yielded 30-40 mg/L. After purification by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography, the RBD protein was characterized by mass-spectrometry, circular dichroism, and binding affinity to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The recombinant protein shows high antigenicity with convalescent human sera and also with sera from individuals vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA or Sputnik V adenoviral-based vaccines. The RBD protein stimulates IFN{gamma}, IL-2, IL-6, IL-4, and TNF in mice secreting splenocytes from PBMC and lung CD3+ enriched cells. Immunogenicity studies with 50 {micro}g of the recombinant RBD formulated with alum, induce high levels of binding antibodies in mice and non-human primates, assessed by ELISA plates covered with RBD protein expressed in HEK293T cells. The mouse sera inhibited the RBD binding to ACE2 receptor in an in-vitro test and show neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells. These data suggest that the RBD recombinant protein expressed in yeast P. pastoris is suitable as a vaccine candidate against COVID-19. HighlightsO_LIThe RBD protein (C-RBD-H6 PP) is expressed with high purity in P. pastoris. C_LIO_LIPhysico-chemical characterization confirms the right folding of the protein. C_LIO_LIThe recombinant protein shows high antigenicity with sera from convalescents. C_LIO_LIThe sera from animals inhibit the RBD-ACE2 binding and neutralize the virus.
