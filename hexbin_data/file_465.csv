3543,3543,3543,Paving the way for precision medicine v2.0 in intensive care by profiling necroinflammation in biofluids,19.350937,11.030146,2018-09-10,"Current clinical diagnosis is typically based on a combination of approaches including clinical examination of the patient, clinical experience, physiologic and/or genetic parameters, high-tech diagnostic medical imaging, and an extended list of laboratory values mostly determined in biofluids such as blood and urine. One could consider this as precision medicine v1.0. However, recent advances in technology and better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying disease will allow us to better characterize patients in the future. These improvements will enable us to distinguish patients who have similar clinical presentations but different cellular and molecular responses. Treatments will be able to be chosen more “precisely”, resulting in more appropriate therapy, precision medicine v2.0. In this review, we will reflect on the potential added value of recent advances in technology and a better molecular understanding of necrosis and inflammation for improving diagnosis and treatment of critically ill patients. We give a brief overview on the mutual interplay between necrosis and inflammation, which are two crucial detrimental factors in organ and/or systemic dysfunction. One of the challenges for the future will thus be the cellular and molecular profiling of necroinflammation in biofluids. The huge amount of data generated by profiling biomolecules and single cells through, for example, different omic-approaches is needed for data mining methods to allow patient-clustering and identify novel biomarkers. The real-time monitoring of biomarkers will allow continuous (re)evaluation of treatment strategies using machine learning models. Ultimately, we may be able to offer precision therapies specifically designed to target the molecular set-up of an individual patient, as has begun to be done in cancer therapeutics.","Vanden Berghe, Tom; Hoste, Eric",Cell Death Differ,465,12

Spectroscopic studies together with ITC and viscosity measurements indicate that both binding modes of the Ru(II) polypyridyl complex to yeast tRNA and CT DNA are intercalation and yeast tRNA binding of the complex is stronger than CT DNA binding. ITC experiments show that the interaction of the complex with yeast tRNA is driven by a moderately favorable enthalpy decrease in combination with a moderately favorable entropy increase, while the binding of the complex to CT DNA is driven by a large favorable enthalpy decrease with a less favorable entropy increase. The results from equilibrium dialysis and CD suggest that both interactions are enantioselective and the Δ enantiomer of the complex may bind more favorably to both yeast tRNA and CT DNA than the Λ enantiomer does, and that the complex is a better candidate for an enantioselective binder to yeast tRNA than to CT DNA. Taken together, these results indicate that the structures of nucleic acids have significant effects on the binding behaviors of metal complexes.","Xu, Hong; Liang, Yi; Zhang, Peng; Du, Fen; Zhou, Bing-Rui; Wu, Jun; Liu, Jian-Hong; Liu, Zhi-Gang; Ji, Liang-Nian",J Biol Inorg Chem,465,5

Along with the bounties of smart things and applications, there are hazards of external and internal attacks. Unfortunately, mitigating internal attacks is quite challenging, where network lifespan (w.r.t. energy consumption at node level), latency, and scalability are the three main factors that influence the efficacy of security measures. Furthermore, most of the security measures provide centralized solutions, ignoring the decentralized nature of SN-powered Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. This paper presents an energy-efficient decentralized trust mechanism using a blockchain-based multi-mobile code-driven solution for detecting internal attacks in sensor node-powered IoT. The results validate the better performance of the proposed solution over existing solutions with 43.94% and 2.67% less message overhead in blackhole and greyhole attack scenarios, respectively. Similarly, the malicious node detection time is reduced by 20.35% and 11.35% in both blackhole and greyhole attacks. Both of these factors play a vital role in improving network lifetime.","Tariq, Noshina; Asim, Muhammad; Khan, Farrukh Aslam; Baker, Thar; Khalid, Umair; Derhab, Abdelouahid",Sensors (Basel),465,5

Network inference from transcriptional time-series data requires accurate, interpretable, and efficient determination of causal relationships among thousands of genes. Here, we develop Bootstrap Elastic net regression from Time Series (BETS), a statistical framework based on Granger causality for the recovery of a directed gene network from transcriptional time-series data. BETS uses elastic net regression and stability selection from bootstrapped samples to infer causal relationships among genes. BETS is highly parallelized, enabling efficient analysis of large transcriptional data sets. We show competitive accuracy on a community benchmark, the DREAM4 100-gene network inference challenge, where BETS is one of the fastest among methods of similar performance and additionally infers whether causal effects are activating or inhibitory. We apply BETS to transcriptional time-series data of differentially-expressed genes from A549 cells exposed to glucocorticoids over a period of 12 hours. We identify a network of 2768 genes and 31,945 directed edges (FDR ≤ 0.2). We validate inferred causal network edges using two external data sources: Overexpression experiments on the same glucocorticoid system, and genetic variants associated with inferred edges in primary lung tissue in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) v6 project.

It is one of the most common types of malignancy of the thyroid that spreads to cervical lymph nodes. Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is an important factor when determining recurrence risk, and determining the extent of lymph node involvement can guide treatment. Our main objective is to evaluate the association between the size of the tumor and the number of lymph node metastases in patients with PTC. Methods: We conducted an electronic retrospective chart review of 125 patients with PTC followed in the Head and Neck Department at KAMC from 2009 to 2020. Twenty-two patients included in our study were pathologically and clinically diagnosed and confirmed to have LNM of PTC. Results: The study included 22 PTC patients who had undergone lymph node dissections. Patients had a median age of 38.8 years (IQR = 32.2–54.5), and the median tumor size was 20.5 mm. The most commonly affected level of the neck was IV (76.2%). Distant metastasis M1 was seen in only two patients (9.1%). Tumors sizes >30mm (75%) had ≥5 LNM. Most cases were the classic subtype PTC. For the site of the tumor, the site had a significant impact on the number of LNM (p = 0.004). Multifocality had a high impact on LNM (p = 0.019). Conclusions: This study showed no association between the size of PTC and the number of LNMs. The bilaterality of PTC was significantly associated with a high number of LNMs.","Aljohani, Amjad O.; Merdad, Reyan H.; Alserif, Anas I.; Alhemayed, Layan S.; Farsi, Noor Z.; Alsufyani, Thamer A.; Alkaf, Haddad H.; Alherabi, Ameen Z.; Abdelmonim, Sherif K.; Alessa, Mohammad A.",Ann Med Surg (Lond),465,1

Data on dermatology consultations provided to inpatients admitted to general surgery wards are limited. The aim of this study was to analyze the reasons for and diagnoses of consultations provided by dermatologists to hospitalized patients in a general surgery ward and compare the provisional diagnoses by surgical residents and the final diagnoses by dermatologists. METHODS: Electronic health records were retrieved for patients admitted to a general surgery ward who received dermatology consultations while inpatients in Peking Union Medical College Hospital between 1 September 2015 and 31 August 2020. Sex, age, surgical diagnosis, reason for dermatology consultation, provisional diagnosis by surgical residents, and final diagnosis by dermatologists were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 262 dermatology consultations for 251 patients (n = 251, 123 women and 128 men) were identified, of whom 240 (95.6%) required only one consultation and 11 (4.4%) required two. Dermatology consultations were classified into three categories: preoperative consultation (n = 45, 17.9%), postoperative consultation (n = 65, 25.9%), and consultation unrelated to general surgery diseases or treatments (including surgery) (n = 141, 56.2%). For consultations falling in the category preoperative consultation, common reasons for the consultation were: to evaluate whether the current treatment plan for previously diagnosed skin diseases needed to be changed; to evaluate and manage skin problems that emerged after admission; to evaluate syphilis; and to evaluate whether previously diagnosed skin diseases would affect surgical incision or wound healing. Drug eruption, dermatitis/eczema, infectious skin disorders, and urticaria were the most common skin diseases in the hospitalized general surgery patients. Only 32 (12.7%) provisional diagnoses were made, of which 25 (78.1%) were correct and seven (21.9%) were incorrect. Surgical residents mainly had difficulty distinguishing herpes zoster, drug eruption, and infectious skin disorders from dermatitis/eczema. CONCLUSION: Our results facilitate the understanding of inpatient dermatology consultations in general surgery wards and may help in the design of future educational materials and/or management guidelines.","Zhang, Hanlin; Tang, Keyun; Fang, Rouyu; Jin, Hongzhong; Sun, Qiuning",Dermatol Ther (Heidelb),465,5

This is ascribed to the advantages offered by the use of MSCs isolated from hPPT over other MSC sources. A paradigm shift in related research is evident that focuses on the secretome of the human MSCs (hMSCs), as therapeutic effects of hMSCs are attributed more so to their secreted growth factors, cytokines and chemokines and to the extracellular vesicles (EVs), all of which are components of the hMSC secretome. Positive therapeutic effects of the hPPT-MSC secretome have been demonstrated in diseases related to skin, kidney, heart, nervous system, cartilage and bones, that have aided fast recovery by replacing damaged, non-functional tissues, via differentiating and regenerating cells. Although certain limitations such as short half -life of the secretome components and irregular secreting patterns exist in secretome therapy, these issues are successfully addressed with the use of cutting-edge technologies such as genome editing and recombinant cytokine treatment. If the current limitations can be successfully overcome, the hPPT-MSC secretome including its EVs may be developed into a cost-effective therapeutic agent amenable to be used against a wide range of diseases/disorders.","Udalamaththa, Vindya Lankika; Kaluarachchi, Athula; Wijeratne, Sumedha; Udagama, Preethi Vidya",Indian J Med Res,465,12

Early diagnosis is essential for managing HIV. Similarly, HPV causes nearly all cases of cervical cancer, the majority (90%) of which occur in low-resource settings. Importantly, infection with HPV is six times more likely to progress to cervical cancer in women who are HIV-positive. An inexpensive, adaptable point-of-care test for viral infections would make screening for these viruses more accessible to a broader set of the population. Here, we report a novel, cost-effective electrochemical platform using gold leaf electrodes to detect clinically relevant viral loads. We have combined this platform with loop-mediated isothermal amplification and a CRISPR-based recognition assay to detect HPV. Lower limits of detection were demonstrated down to 10(4) total copies of input nucleic acids, which is a clinically relevant viral load for HPV DNA. Further, proof-of-concept experiments with cervical swab samples, extracted using standard extraction protocols, demonstrated that the strategy is extendable to complex human samples. This adaptable technology could be applied to detect any viral infection rapidly and cost-effectively.","Zamani, Marjon; Robson, James M.; Fan, Andy; Bono, Michael S.; Furst, Ariel L.; Klapperich, Catherine M.",ACS Cent Sci,465,5

RNF213 is a poorly characterized, interferon-induced megaprotein that is frequently mutated in Moyamoya disease, a rare cerebrovascular disorder. We report that interferon induces ISGylation and oligomerization of RNF213 on lipid droplets, where it acts as a sensor for ISGylated proteins. We show that RNF213 has broad antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo, counteracting infection with Listeria monocytogenes, herpes simplex virus 1, human respiratory syncytial virus and coxsackievirus B3, and we observe a striking co-localization of RNF213 with intracellular bacteria.

Computational methods for predicting protein structures from their sequences are now heavily based on machine learning tools and on approaches that extract knowledge and rules from data using probabilistic models. Many of these methods use scoring functions to determine which structure best fits a native protein sequence. Using computational approaches, we obtained two scoring functions: knowledge-based energy and likelihood of base frequency, and we compared their accuracy in measuring the sequence structure fit. We compared the machine learning models’ accuracy of predictions for knowledge-based energy and likelihood values to validate our results, showing that likelihood is a more accurate scoring function than knowledge-based energy.","Serafimova, Katerina; Mihaylov, Iliyan; Vassilev, Dimitar; Avdjieva, Irena; Zielenkiewicz, Piotr; Kaczanowski, Szymon",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,465,24

Current U.S. President Trump’s reliance on Twitter is unprecedented, but the underlying implications for agenda setting are poorly understood. Using the president as a case study, we present evidence suggesting that President Trump’s use of Twitter diverts crucial media (The New York Times and ABC News) from topics that are potentially harmful to him. We find that increased media coverage of the Mueller investigation is immediately followed by Trump tweeting increasingly about unrelated issues. This increased activity, in turn, is followed by a reduction in coverage of the Mueller investigation—a finding that is consistent with the hypothesis that President Trump’s tweets may also successfully divert the media from topics that he considers threatening. The pattern is absent in placebo analyses involving Brexit coverage and several other topics that do not present a political risk to the president. Our results are robust to the inclusion of numerous control variables and examination of several alternative explanations, although the generality of the successful diversion must be established by further investigation.","Lewandowsky, Stephan; Jetter, Michael; Ecker, Ullrich K.

Therefore, it is of great significance to analyze navigational risks to ensure the safety of waterborne transportation. In this paper, the navigational risks of Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge (NYRB) waters are investigated based on spatiotemporal mining on massive automatic identification system (AIS) trajectories by using geographic information system (GIS) techniques. A time-series-oriented trajectory processing method is proposed to deal with the historical AIS data in the whole year of 2019. The method adopts a periodic processing strategy to produce traffic density estimation products in multiple temporal scales for supporting spatiotemporal analysis. The proposed method greatly improves the data-processing efficiency and provides a flexible way to deeply understand the vessel behavior patterns in NYRB waters. Then the complete characteristics of the spatial distribution and temporal variation of AIS trajectories are revealed. Based on that, three types of critical navigational risks are discovered, which include the safety distance risk, the pier collision risk, and the traffic congestion risk.

However, no studies have yet compared TLV and OLV with postoperative infection and inflammation in the prone position over time postoperatively. Here, we investigated the efficacy of TLV in patients undergoing VATS-e in the prone position. METHODS Between April 2010 and December 2016, 119 patients underwent VATS-e under OLV or TLV with carbon dioxide insufflation. Clinical characteristics, surgical outcomes, and postoperative outcomes, including oxygenation and systemic inflammatory responses, were compared between patients who underwent OLV and those who underwent TLV. RESULTS Clinical characteristics other than pT stage were comparable between groups. The TLV group had shorter thoracic operation time than the OLV group. No patients underwent conversion to open thoracotomy. The PaO2/FiO2 ratios of the TLV group on postoperative day (POD) 5 and on POD7 were significantly higher than those of the OLV group. C-reactive protein levels on POD7 were lower in the TLV group than in the OLV group. There were no significant differences with respect to postoperative complications between the OLV and TLV groups. In the TLV group, the white blood cell count on POD7 was significantly lower than that in the OLV group; body temperature showed a similar trend immediately after surgery and on POD1. CONCLUSIONS In this study, we demonstrated that, compared with OLV, TLV in the prone position provides better oxygenation and reduced inflammation in the postoperative course. Accordingly, TLV might be more useful than OLV for ventilation during esophageal cancer surgery.","Nomura, Shinsuke; Tsujimoto, Hironori; Ishibashi, Yusuke; Fujishima, Seiichiro; Kouzu, Keita; Harada, Manabu; Ito, Nozomi; Yaguchi, Yoshihisa; Saitoh, Daizoh; Ikeda, Takehiko; Hase, Kazuo; Kishi, Yoji; Ueno, Hideki",Surgical endoscopy,465,1

Renal sympathetic denervation (RDN) decreases sympathetic renal efferent and afferent nerve activity. METHODS Obese spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs-ob) were subjected to RDN at the age of 34 weeks (SHRs-ob + RDN) and were compared with sham-operated SHRs-ob and their normotensive lean controls (Ctrs). Blood pressure was measured by telemetry. Kidney and heart function were determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Renal and cardiac remodeling were characterized by immunohistochemical analyses. Animals were killed at the age of 48 weeks. RESULTS In SHRs-ob, RDN attenuated the progressive increase in blood pressure and preserved a mean blood pressure of 156±7mm Hg compared with 220±8mm Hg in sham-operated SHRs-ob at 100 days after RDN, whereas heart rate, body weight, and metabolic parameters remained unchanged. Renal catecholamine and tyrosine hydroxylase levels were significantly reduced after RDN, suggesting effective renal denervation. Progression of renal dysfunction as characterized by increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio and reduced glomerular filtration rate were attenuated by RDN. In SHRs-ob, renal perfusion was significantly reduced and normalized by RDN. Cardiac fibrosis and cardiac diastolic dysfunction measured by MRI and invasive pressure measurements were significantly attenuated by RDN. CONCLUSIONS In SHRs-ob, progressive increase in blood pressure and progression of renal injury and cardiac remodelling are mediated by renal sympathetic activation as they were attenuated by RDN.","Linz, Dominik; Hohl, Mathias; Schütze, Jonathan; Mahfoud, Felix; Speer, Thimoteus; Linz, Benedikt; Hübschle, Thomas; Juretschke, Hans-Paul; Dechend, Ralf; Geisel, Jürgen; Rütten, Hartmut; Böhm, Michael",American journal of hypertension,465,0

We aimed to demonstrate the usefulness of an immediate postinterventional DWI protocol including B0 and gradient recalled-echo sequences to discriminate those 2 conditions through phantom and preliminary retrospective patient studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS On 3T MR imaging, the signal intensities of the phantom models consisting of iodinated contrast agents diluted with normal saline and arterial blood were compared using T1WI, T2WI, and gradient recalled-echo sequences. A total 17 patients (8 with hemorrhagic transformation and 9 with contrast staining; 8 men and 9 women; mean age, 72.00 ± 10.91 years; range, 52-90 years) who underwent mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke and showed newly appearing hyperdense lesions on immediate (<24 hours) postinterventional nonenhanced CT scans were included in this study. Immediate postinterventional DWI of patients were compared. RESULTS In the phantom study, iodinated contrast agents diluted with normal saline showed minimal signal drop, while those diluted with arterial blood demonstrated dark signal intensity in the T2WI and gradient recalled-echo sequences. In the patient study, all hemorrhagic transformations and none of the contrast staining demonstrated dark or low signal (<gray matter) intensities similar to those of the vessel in the B0-DWI and gradient recalled-echo images. CONCLUSIONS According to our preliminary results, contrast staining might be differentiated from hemorrhagic transformation using an immediate postinterventional DWI protocol including gradient recalled-echo sequences. It might be possible to expedite establishment of postinterventional medical treatment strategy.","You, S-H; Kim, B; Kim, B K; Suh, S-I",AJNR. American journal of neuroradiology,465,1

Yet, access to the levels of water supply that support good hand hygiene and institutional cleaning, our understanding of hygiene behaviours, and access to soap are deficient in low-, middle- and high-income countries. This paper reviews the role of water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) in disease emergence, previous outbreaks, combatting COVID-19 and in preparing for future pandemics. We consider settings where these factors are particularly important and identify key preventive contributions to disease control and gaps in the evidence base. Urgent substantial action is required to remedy deficiencies in WaSH, particularly the provision of reliable, continuous piped water on-premises for all households and settings. Hygiene promotion programmes, underpinned by behavioural science, must be adapted to high-risk populations (such as the elderly and marginalised) and settings (such as healthcare facilities, transport hubs and workplaces). WaSH must be better integrated into preparation plans and with other sectors in prevention efforts. More finance and better use of financing instruments would extend and improve WaSH services. The lessons outlined justify no-regrets investment by government in response to and recovery from the current pandemic; to improve day-to-day lives and as preparedness for future pandemics.","Howard, Guy; Bartram, Jamie; Brocklehurst, Clarissa; Colford, John M; Costa, Federico; Cunliffe, David; Dreibelbis, Robert; Eisenberg, Joseph Neil Spindel; Evans, Barbara; Girones, Rosina; Hrudey, Steve; Willetts, Juliet; Wright, Caradee Y",Journal of water and health,465,1

The dental environment has a high risk of viral transmission; accordingly, this study aimed to identify recommendations based on the best available evidence for dental care during this pandemic. Methods We performed a search for scientific evidence published since 2002 to March 23th 2020 in electronic databases (MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Epistemonikos) and the web pages of the American Dental Association, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Oral Health, the Ministry of Health in Chile and scientific societies. Results We included nine published studies. The recommendations were the following: unrestricted use of personal protection elements, use of extraoral radiographic techniques, use of mouth rinses with 1% hydrogen peroxide or 0.2% iodine povidone, a four-hand technique with ongoing aspiration and the use of absorbable sutures. Furthermore, there is a consensus that non-urgent treatments should be postponed during periods of community transmission. Conclusions Dental practitioners are exposed to a high risk of cross-infection, meaning they must implement recommendations based on the best available evidence to preserve the health of team members and the population they are caring for.","Vargas-Buratovic, Juan Pablo; Verdugo-Paiva, Francisca; Véliz-Paiva, Claudia; López-Tagle, Elizabeth; Ahumada-Salinas, Alexis; Ortuño-Borroto, Duniel",Medwave,465,5

Among the factors, the density and particle size have negligible effects on particle trajectory, while the vertical coordinates of particles increase with the rise in heating source temperature. When the heating temperature is higher than 355 K , all of the particles exit the channel from one outlet; thus, the collecting and accumulating of virus-laden aerosols can be realized.

The poor logistic infrastructure across the BRI region not only restricts trade potential and economic progress but also creates several social and environmental challenges. Therefore, this study investigates the relationship between green logistic operations, economic, environmental, and social indicators of countries along with the BRI. This study provides three key findings using feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) and system generalized method of moments (Sys-GMM) estimation techniques. First, Chinese outward foreign direct investment significantly improves the quality and quantity of green logistic operations in terms of transport infrastructure, customs services, cost, time, tracking, and reliability of international shipments. Second, a higher quality of transport-related infrastructure, customs clearance efficiency, and competency of logistics services significantly mitigate the level of carbon emissions due to the energy conservation in the supply chain process. Moreover, the application of renewable energy resources significantly improves the quality of logistics operations. These results indicate that higher quality of green logistic operations provides efficient infrastructure and greater information sharing among supply chain partners that increase trade volume, growth opportunities, and environmental sustainability. Third, a higher institutional quality helps to mitigate social concerns through improvement in the efficiency of logistic operations. Although BRI regional estimates show significant variations, the overall results imply that BRI participating countries should integrate with ongoing investment projects to promote the quality and quantity of green logistic infrastructure and ensuring environmental stewardship.","An, Hui; Razzaq, Asif; Nawaz, Ahsan; Noman, Sohail M; Khan, Syed Abdul Rehman",Environmental science and pollution research international,465,16

Because of the relatively high recurrence rate after surgery, additional procedures such as mechanical pleurodesis or visceral pleural coverage are usually applied to minimize recurrence, although mechanical pleurodesis has some potential disadvantages. The aim of this study was to clarify whether an additional coverage procedure on the staple line after thoracoscopic bullectomy prevents postoperative recurrence compared with additional pleurodesis. METHODS A total of 1,414 patients in 11 hospitals with primary spontaneous pneumothorax undergoing thoracoscopic bullectomy were enrolled. After bullectomy with staplers, patients were randomly assigned to either the coverage group (n = 757) or the pleurodesis group (n = 657). In the coverage group, the staple line was covered with absorbable cellulose mesh and fibrin glue. The pleurodesis group underwent additional mechanical abrasion on the parietal pleura. RESULTS The coverage group and the pleurodesis group showed comparable surgical outcomes. After a median follow-up of 19.5 months, the postoperative 1-year recurrence rate was 9.5% in the coverage group and 10.7% in the pleurodesis group. The 1-year recurrence rate requiring intervention was 5.8% in the coverage group and 7.8% in the pleurodesis group. The coverage group showed better recovery from pain. CONCLUSIONS In terms of postoperative recurrence rate, visceral pleural coverage after thoracoscopic bullectomy was not inferior to mechanical pleurodesis. Visceral pleural coverage may potentially replace mechanical pleurodesis, which has potential disadvantages such as disturbed normal pleural physiology.","Lee, Sungsoo; Kim, Hyeong Ryul; Cho, Sukki; Huh, Dong Myung; Lee, Eung Bae; Ryu, Kyoung Min; Cho, Deug Gon; Paik, Hyo Chae; Kim, Dong Kwan; Lee, Sung-Ho; Cho, Jeong Su; Lee, Jae Ik; Choi, Ho; Kim, Kwhanmien; Jheon, Sanghoon",The Annals of thoracic surgery,465,1

Therefore, a less invasive and novel biopsy technique is needed. OBJECTIVE To introduce a window technique for nail matrix biopsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and histopathological specimens of patients with LM who underwent the window technique for nail matrix biopsy at our institution between September 2015 and December 2016. RESULTS Eleven cases from 10 patients with LM were subjected to our tailored window technique assisted by carbon dioxide (CO2) laser and dermoscopy. We performed nail plate dermoscopy to select the biopsy site and used CO2 laser to create the window in the proximal nail plate. Nail matrix pigmentation was carefully investigated using intraoperative dermoscopy. The technique established appropriate diagnosis in 11 LM cases, without significant complications, as follows: melanoma in situ (4 cases) and nail matrix activation (7 cases). CONCLUSION The window technique assisted by CO2 laser and dermoscopy can be a minimally invasive and effective method for nail matrix LM biopsy under local anesthesia.","Ohn, Jungyoon; Jo, Gwanghyun; Chae, Je Byeong; Mun, Je-Ho",Dermatologic surgery : official publication for American Society for Dermatologic Surgery [et al.],465,12

Faecal samples from 55 cases of HE and 26 clinically normal animals were collected, and a quantitative examination of Eimeria and potential enteropathogenic bacteria was performed. The number of Eimeria species oocysts per gram of faeces (OPG) exceeded 10,000 in 69.1 per cent of HE cases with a maximum of 1,452,500 OPG and Eimeria zuernii was found to be overwhelmingly dominant. A significant increase in faecal coliform count was observed in HE cases compared with clinically normal animals. Among the animals shedding >10,000 OPG, 42.9 per cent showed a remarkable increase in Clostridium perfringens abundance (>104 CFU/g) in the faeces. In the cases with C. perfringens detected, its abundance was positively correlated with Eimeria OPG and high C. perfringens abundance was always accompanied by high Eimeria OPG.

Also, the biochemical effects of both drugs alone at nominal concentrations of 2 and 10 μg/L as well as in combination with total concentrations of 4 and 20 μg/L were investigated in Carassius carassius after 7 d exposure followed by 10 d recovery. In the single treatments, steady-state BCFs measured after the 7 d exposure were 73.05, 49.71, 38.01 and 24.93 L/kg for diclofenac and 9.25, 8.99, 5.29 and 4.11 L/kg for carbamazepine in the liver, brain, gill and muscle of Carassius carassius, respectively. Comparatively lower BCFs were measured in the tissues of Carassius carassius for both drugs in the combined treatments. Acetylcholinesterase activity in the brain was significantly induced by diclofenac while carbamazepine and the mixtures significantly inhibited it during all the exposure days as well as after the 10 d recovery in all treatments. This indicates that Carassius carassius could not recover from the neurotoxic effects caused by carbamazepine unlike the inductive effect caused by diclofenac which was recoverable after 10 days. A significant increase in the activities of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase and glutathione s-transferase for individual and mixed pharmaceuticals suggest that metabolism and detoxification of both drugs took place in the liver of Carassius carassius. Also, a significant increase in the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase and malondialdehyde contents in the individual and mixture treatments mean that the antioxidant defence system of Carassius carassius was triggered to fight against oxidative stress but lipid peroxidation still occurred. However, Carassius carassius recovered from all these increases (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase and malondialdehyde) after the 10 d recovery, suggesting that oxidative damage is reversible. Our results indicate that both drugs at environmentally relevant concentrations might cause adverse effects in Carassius carassius and other fish species.","Nkoom, Matthew; Lu, Guanghua; Liu, Jianchao; Dong, Huike",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,465,1

Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms may be useful in this context as they can automatically classify large volumes of narrative data. However, it is unknown if NLP models can accurately evaluate surgical trainee feedback. This study evaluated which NLP techniques best classify the quality of surgical trainee formative feedback recorded as part of a workplace assessment. METHOD During the 2016-2017 academic year, the SIMPL (Society for Improving Medical Professional Learning) app was used to record operative performance narrative feedback for residents at 3 university-based general surgery residency training programs. Feedback comments were collected for a sample of residents representing all 5 postgraduate year levels and coded for quality. In May 2019, the coded comments were then used to train NLP models to automatically classify the quality of feedback across 4 categories (effective, mediocre, ineffective, or other). Models included support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression, gradient boosted trees, naive Bayes, and random forests. The primary outcome was mean classification accuracy. RESULTS The authors manually coded the quality of 600 recorded feedback comments. Those data were used to train NLP models to automatically classify the quality of feedback across 4 categories. The NLP model utilizing an SVM algorithm yielded a maximum mean accuracy of 0.64 (standard deviation, 0.01). When the classification task was modified to distinguish only high quality vs. low-quality feedback, maximum mean accuracy was 0.83, again with SVM. CONCLUSIONS To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to examine the use of NLP for classifying feedback quality. SVM NLP models demonstrated the ability to automatically classify the quality of surgical trainee evaluations. Larger training data sets would likely further increase accuracy.","Ötleş, Erkin; Kendrick, Dan; Solano, Quintin P; Schuller, Mary; Ahle, Samantha L; Eskender, Mickyas H; Carnes, Emily; George, Brian C",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,465,19

Overall survival, influence of treatment allocation on prognosis, and factors affecting treatment allocation were evaluated. RESULTS The 5-year survival rate was 59.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 51.6-66.8%] in the curative group, and 25.1% (95% CI 11.5-38.7%) in the TACE group. Treatment allocation was the only significant prognostic factor (p = 0.014, hazard ratio: 0.382, 95% CI 0.177-0.821). The curative group consisted of more patients with Child-Pugh A (p = 0.0016) than the TACE group, a tumor number of 3 or fewer (p < 0.0001), a unilobar tumor location (p = 0.02), within 4 of 7 cm criterion (p = 0.001), and within up-to-7 criterion (p = 0.04).

Nearly two-thirds of all students study in a 'broad' degree, such as a Bachelor of Health Science or Master of Public Health. There has been an increase in the proportion of overseas students and a decreasing proportion of Indigenous students over this time. CONCLUSIONS Given the growth of graduates with public health degrees, there should be an increased focus on relevant job opportunities, as supply may be outpacing demand. Implications for public health: We note three potential issues with public health education and practice in Australia. Firstly, there may be an oversupply of graduates relative to opportunities. Secondly, there may be inconsistencies in the delivery of public health courses.

The sense that HCWs felt that they had a duty to work despite personal risk emerged strongly regardless of professional status. Besides a strong sense that everyone should pull together, all kinds of HCWs recognised a duty to work even in difficult circumstances, which correlated strongly with their stated likelihood of working. This suggests that HCWs' decisions about whether or not they are prepared to work during a pandemic are closely linked to their sense of duty. However, respondents' sense of the duty to work may conflict with their sense of duty to family, as well as other factors such as a perceived lack of reciprocity from their employers. Interestingly, nearly 25% of doctors did not consider that they had a duty to work where doing so would pose risks to themselves or their families.","Damery, S; Draper, H; Wilson, S; Greenfield, S; Ives, J; Parry, J; Petts, J; Sorell, T",Journal of medical ethics,465,31

The ability to predict residues of the RdRp required for faithful incorporation of nucleotides represents an essential step in any pipeline intended to exploit perturbed fidelity as the basis for rational design of vaccine candidates. We used x-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, NMR spectroscopy, and pre-steady-state kinetics to compare a mutator (H273R) RdRp from poliovirus to the wild-type (WT) enzyme. We show that the nucleotide-binding site toggles between the nucleotide binding-occluded and nucleotide binding-competent states. The conformational dynamics between these states were enhanced by binding to primed template RNA. For the WT, the occluded conformation was favored; for H273R, the competent conformation was favored. The resonance for Met-187 in our NMR spectra reported on the ability of the enzyme to check the correctness of the bound nucleotide. Kinetic experiments were consistent with the conformational dynamics contributing to the established pre-incorporation conformational change and fidelity checkpoint. For H273R, residues comprising the active site spent more time in the catalytically competent conformation and were more positively correlated than the WT. We propose that by linking the equilibrium between the binding-occluded and binding-competent conformations of the nucleotide-binding pocket and other active-site dynamics to the correctness of the bound nucleotide, faithful nucleotide incorporation is achieved. These studies underscore the need to apply multiple biophysical and biochemical approaches to the elucidation of the physical basis for polymerase fidelity.","Moustafa, Ibrahim M; Korboukh, Victoria K; Arnold, Jamie J; Smidansky, Eric D; Marcotte, Laura L; Gohara, David W; Yang, Xiaorong; Sánchez-Farrán, María Antonieta; Filman, David; Maranas, Janna K; Boehr, David D; Hogle, James M; Colina, Coray M; Cameron, Craig E",The Journal of biological chemistry,465,6

METHODS Thirty-one patients were monitored with cerebral oximetry as a surrogate marker of perfusion while undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement via a transfemoral approach under general anesthesia to detect intraoperative hypoperfusion insult. Serial neurologic, cognitive, and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging assessments were administered to objectively quantify perioperative neurologic injury and ascertain any association with significant cerebral oximetry disturbances. RESULTS Cerebral oximetry reacted promptly to rapid ventricular pacing with significant cerebral desaturation, relative to baseline, of greater than 12% and greater than 20% in 12 of 31 (68%) and 9 of 31 (29%) patients, respectively; or to an absolute measurement of less than 50% in 10 of 31 (33%) patients. Hyperemia occurred immediately following relief of aortic stenosis exceeding baseline by greater than 10% and greater than 20% in 14 of 31 (45%) and 5 of 31 (16%) patients. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction was evident in 3 of 31 (10%) patients and new magnetic resonance imaging-defined ischemic lesions were seen in 17 of 28 (61%) patients. No patient experienced clinically apparent stroke. CONCLUSIONS Cerebral oximetry reacted promptly to rapid ventricular pacing with significant desaturation and hyperemia a common occurrence.

Although the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have long-lasting adverse psychological effects on children, there have been comparatively few studies on children's health as compared with adults, particularly in low-income countries. Uganda implemented one of the most stringent lockdowns with bans on transportation and gatherings as well as the closure of schools, stores and places of worship. In order to address the dearth of information in less developed regions, the article aims to provide an insight into the increased cases of child abuse in Uganda during the COVID-19 pandemic. The data and information were primarily compiled from government and child welfare organisation open-source databases. The psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 have greatly disrupted the living conditions of children, limiting their access to basic needs such as food and health care. In addition, there is a lack of social support, thus putting children at an increased risk of different forms of child abuse. Since the implementation of the COVID-19 lockdown in Uganda, there has been a rise in the incidence of child abuse. Increased cases of physical and sexual abuse against children have been reported in different parts of the country as well as increased cases of child labour. To strengthen child protection during the COVID-19 pandemic, this article highlights a need for multi-level stakeholder cooperation to ensure increased funding, increased community awareness and sensitisation, early detection and effective management and referral of child abuse cases.","Sserwanja, Quraish; Kawuki, Joseph; Kim, Jean H",Journal of paediatrics and child health,465,4

At that time, most patients with OUD were considered to have anti-social personality disorders and the regulations aimed to exert maximal control over medication access. Six- or seven-day clinic attendance is required for months, regardless of distance, or childcare and other social responsibilities. Take home medications are not allowed unless rigid and formulaic conditions are met. Although addiction medicine has rejected the ""criminal"" paradigm in favor of OUD as a treatable medical disorder, methadone regulations have not kept pace with the science.Pregnancy is characterized by an ultra-rapid metabolic state, but regulations prevent the use of daily divided doses of methadone to maintain stability. This results in repeated episodes of maternal/fetal opioid withdrawal, as well as other fetal physiologic abnormalities. Interference with dose regimen adjustments prevents optimal outcomes.Further, methadone clinics are mostly urban, leaving patients in rural areas without access. This led to excessive morbidity and mortality when the opioid crisis hit. The response of merely expanding capacity in overcrowded urban clinics created a contagion menace when Covid-19 arrived. Pregnant women (and parents with children) were forced to negotiate dosing in dangerous conditions.A revised methadone system must provide treatment that is local, flexible, and limited in size to manage viral contagion risks. This regulatory change can most easily be started by changing regulations that adversely affect pregnant women.","McCarthy, John J; Jones, Hendree E; Terplan, Mishka; Rudolf, Vania P; von Klimo, Melinda Campopiano",Journal of addiction medicine,465,1

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of TFTs for individuals with depression as their primary concern. METHODS A systematic search was conducted for RCTs published before October 2019 in Cochrane CENTRAL, Pubmed, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and additional sources. Trials examining the impact of TFTs on participants with depression were included. Trials focusing on individuals with PTSD or another mental health condition were excluded. The primary outcome was the effect size for depression diagnosis or depressive symptoms. Heterogeneity, study quality, and publication bias were also explored. RESULTS Eleven RCTs were included (n = 567) with ten of these using EMDR as the TFT and one using imagery rescripting. Analysis suggested these TFTs were effective in reducing depressive symptoms post-treatment with a large effect size [d = 1.17 (95% CI: 0.58~ 1.75)]. Removal of an outlier saw the effect size remain large [d = 0.83 (95% CI: 0.48~ 1.17)], while the heterogeneity decreased (I2 = 66%). Analysis of the 10 studies that used EMDR also showed a large effect [d = 1.30 (95% CI: 0.67~1.91)]. EMDR was superior to non trauma-focused CBT [d = 0.66 (95% CI: 0.31~1.02)] and analysis of EMDR and imagery rescripting studies suggest superiority over inactive control conditions [d = 1.19 (95% CI: 0.53~ 1.86)]. Analysis of follow-up data also supported the use of EMDR with this population [d = 0.71 (95% CI: 1.04~0.38)]. No publication bias was identified. CONCLUSIONS Current evidence suggests that EMDR can be an effective treatment for depression. There were insufficient RCTs on other trauma-focused interventions to conclude whether TFTs in general were effective for treating depression. Larger studies with robust methodology using EMDR and other trauma-focused interventions are needed to build on these findings.","Dominguez, Sarah K; Matthijssen, Suzy J M A; Lee, Christopher William",PloS one,465,10

We aimed to evaluate blood pressure change and antihypertensive needs of patients within one year after changeover to remote monitoring automated peritoneal dialysis (RM-APD) and compare the effect of RM-APD and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) on peripheral and central hemodynamic parameters, volume status of patients and antihypertensive drug needs. METHODS This was an observational and cross-sectional study. We enrolled 15 patients performing CAPD, 20 patients performing RM-APD, and 38 age, and gender-matched healthy control. We measured pulse wave velocity to assess arterial stiffness, peripheral and central hemodynamic parameters. We measured volume status of participants via bioimpedance spectroscopy. RESULTS The mean excess hydration of patients who underwent CAPD were higher than those who performed RM-APD and healthy control (p=0.02). We found that mean diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, central systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and central pulse pressure were significantly different between the RM-APD, CAPD and healthy control (p=0.02, p=0.05, p=0.007, p=0.05 and p=0.005, respectively). Post-hoc analysis of these results showed that the differences between the groups were caused by the healthy control group and the patients with underwent CAPD. Daily anti-hypertensive drug count in patients with performing RM-APD was reduced over time (p<0.001).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the capacity of high-resolution contrast enhanced 3D time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography using new generation 3 T imaging technology to provide detailed visualization of CN VI anatomy, particularly within the cavernous sinus and petroclival regions. METHODS Two neuroradiologists conducted bilateral evaluation of CN VI visibility in 23 patients for nerve segments located in the petroclival segment (dural cave and Dorello's canal), and three divisions of the cavernous sinus. All images were collected using contrast enhanced TOF MR angiography using a new generation 3 T machine. RESULTS Of the CN VI segments assessed, average visibility of CN VI was best achieved in Dorello's canal. Overall visibility of CN VI within the regions inspected was best achieved in the axial view, with the exception of the dural cave, which was best assessed using the coronal view. We also identified strong agreement in assessment of nerve visibility between the two reviewers. We also identified a putative CN6 duplication and a small schwannoma, highlighting the fidelity of our approach. CONCLUSION Contrast enhanced 3D TOF MR angiography can visualize CN VI anatomy, particularly within the petrocavernosal region and cavernous sinus with simultaneous visualization of arterial and venous structures. This cannot be easily achieved using traditional MRI techniques. This imaging technique might be used with new generation machines to evaluate CN VI anatomy and pathologies within the petrocavernosal region and cavernous sinus, especially relating to vascular pathologies.","Smith, Garrett; Tuna, Ibrahim Sacit; Massini, Tara C; Tufan, Fatih; Albayram, Mehmet Sait",Clinical imaging,465,0

Increasingly, the arts have become more widely established and accepted as health-promoting practices in the United States and around the world. As the U.S. health care system moves toward greater integration of physical and behavioral health, arts-based interventions should be considered among potential complementary approaches for managing pain and preventing and treating SUD. We conducted an integrative literature review to summarize and synthesize the evidence on the role of the arts in the management of pain and in the prevention and treatment of SUD, including opioid use disorder. The available evidence suggests that music interventions may reduce participants' pain, reduce the amount of pain medication they take, improve their SUD treatment readiness and motivation, and reduce craving. Few studies examined art forms other than music, limiting the ability to draw conclusions for those art forms. Given the critical need to identify effective strategies for managing pain and preventing and treating SUD, future research on arts-based interventions should examine maintenance of pain management and SUD treatment benefits over time and outcomes related to SUD prevention.","Leis, Julie A; Morrison, Colleen I",Health promotion practice,465,30

Some people may turn to alcohol to cope with stress during the pandemic, which may put them at risk for heavy drinking and alcohol-related harms. Research is needed to identify factors that are relevant for coping-motivated drinking during these extraordinary circumstances to inform interventions. This study provides an empirical examination of coping motive pathways to alcohol problems during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Participants (N = 320; 54.7% male; mean age of 32 years) were Canadian adult drinkers who completed an online survey assessing work- and home-related factors, psychological factors, and alcohol-related outcomes over the past 30 days, covering a time period beginning within 1 month of the initiation of the COVID-19 emergency response. RESULTS The results of a theory-informed path model showed that having at least 1 child under the age of 18, greater depression, and lower social connectedness each predicted unique variance in past 30-day coping motives, which in turn predicted increased past 30-day alcohol use (controlling for pre-COVID-19 alcohol use reported retrospectively). Income loss was associated with increased alcohol use, and living alone was associated with increased solitary drinking (controlling for pre-COVID-19 levels), but these associations were not mediated by coping motives. Increased alcohol use, increased solitary drinking, and greater coping motives for drinking were all independently associated with past 30-day alcohol problems, and indirect paths to alcohol problems from having children at home, depression, social connectedness, income loss, and living alone were all supported. CONCLUSIONS Findings provide insight into coping-motivated drinking early in the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for longitudinal research to establish longer term outcomes of drinking to cope during the pandemic.","Wardell, Jeffrey D; Kempe, Tyler; Rapinda, Karli K; Single, Alanna; Bilevicius, Elena; Frohlich, Jona R; Hendershot, Christian S; Keough, Matthew T","Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",465,16

They are able to infect many host, such as mammals or birds. Whereas CoVs were identified 1930s, they became known again in 2003 as the agents of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The spike protein is thought to be essential in the process of CoVs entry, because it is associated with the binding to the receptor on the host cell. It is also involved in cell tropism and pathogenesis. Receptor recognition is the crucial step in the infection. CoVs are able to bind a variety of receptors, although the selection of receptor remains unclear. Coronaviruses were initially believed to enter cells by fusion with the plasma membrane. Further studies demonstrated that many of them involve endocytosis through clathrin-dependent, caveolae-dependent, clathrin-independent, as well as caveolae-independent mechanisms. The aim of this review is to summarise current knowledge about coronaviruses, focussing especially on CoVs entry into the host cell. Advances in understanding coronaviruses replication strategy and the functioning of the replicative structures are also highlighted. The development of host-directed antiviral therapy seems to be a promising way to treat infections with SARS-CoV or other pathogenic coronaviruses. There is still much to be discovered in the inventory of pro- and anti-viral host factors relevant for CoVs replication.

However, the cognitive consequences of frailty after cardiac surgery have not been well described. In this study, we examined the hypothesis that baseline frailty would be associated with postoperative delirium and cognitive change at 1 and 12 months after cardiac surgery. METHODS This study was nested in 2 trials, each of which was conducted by the same research team with identical measurement of exposures and outcomes. Before surgery, patients were assessed with the validated ""Fried"" frailty scale, which evaluates 5 domains (shrinking, weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slowed walking speed) and classifies patients as nonfrail, prefrail, and frail. The primary outcome was postoperative delirium during hospitalization, which was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method, Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit, and validated chart review. Neuropsychological testing was a secondary outcome and was generally performed within 2 weeks of surgery and then 4-6 weeks and 1 year after surgery, and the outcome of interest was change in composite Z-score of the test battery. Associations were analyzed using logistic and linear regression models, with adjustment for variables considered a priori (age, gender, race, education, and logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation). Multiple imputation was used to account for missing data at the 12-month follow-up. RESULTS Data were available from 133 patients with baseline frailty assessments. Compared to nonfrail patients (13% delirium incidence), the incidence of delirium was higher in prefrail (48% delirium incidence; risk difference, 35%; 95% CI, 10%-51%) and frail patients (48% delirium incidence; risk difference, 35%; 95% CI, 7%-53%). In both univariable and multivariable models, the odds of delirium were significantly higher for prefrail (adjusted odds ratio, 6.43; 95% CI, 1.31-31.64; P = .02) and frail patients (adjusted odds ratio, 6.31; 95% CI, 1.18-33.74; P = .03) compared to nonfrail patients. The adjusted decline in composite cognitive Z-score was greater from baseline to 1 month only in frail patients compared to nonfrail patients. By 1 year after surgery, there were no differences in the association of baseline frailty with change in cognition. CONCLUSIONS Compared to nonfrail patients, both prefrail and frail patients were at higher risk for the primary outcome of delirium after cardiac surgery. Frail patients were also at higher risk for the secondary outcome of greater decline in cognition from baseline to 1 month, but not baseline to 1 year, after surgery.","Nomura, Yohei; Nakano, Mitsunori; Bush, Brian; Tian, Jing; Yamaguchi, Atsushi; Walston, Jeremy; Hasan, Rani; Zehr, Kenton; Mandal, Kaushik; LaFlam, Andrew; Neufeld, Karin J; Kamath, Vidyulata; Hogue, Charles W; Brown, Charles H",Anesthesia and analgesia,465,12

The assay uses DNA probes that are designed to bind to the conserved open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab), envelope protein (E) and the nucleocapsid (N) regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and a fluorescent-nanoparticle-labelled monoclonal antibody that binds to double-stranded DNA-RNA hybrids. In a multi-hospital randomized double-blind trial involving 734 samples (593 throat swabs and 141 sputum) provided by 670 individuals, the assay achieved sensitivities of 100% and specificities of 99% for both types of sample (ground truth was determined using quantitative PCR with reverse transcription).

Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome diagnosed in patients responsive to gluten-free diet after ruling out celiac disease and wheat allergy. The pathogenesis of neuro-psychiatric disorders in NCGS is unclear. An association between gluten and schizophrenia was described for the first time in 1950 by Bender et al. In the 1950's, Dicke noted that gluten-free diet improved mood in celiac patients. In 1970, Goldberg et al., in a study of 80 celiac patients, found that 34% of them showed minor affective disorders. Bipolar disorder patients show an increase of blood anti gliadin deamidated antibodies (IgG). The effect of diet and nutrition on autistic spectrum disorders has been investigated in the last two decades, particularly focusing on the symptoms of hyperactivity and attention. Toxoplasma gondii and other neurotropic pathogens as Influenzavirus and Coronavirus may be associated with mood disorders, probably secondary to an increased intestinal permeability. Abnormalities of host-microbiota interactions or of gut-microbiota composition have been associated with central nervous system disorders, such as autism, anxiety, depression and the integrity of intestinal microbiota may be considered a potential therapeutic goal to treat these conditions.","Casella, Giovanni; Pozzi, Roberta; Cigognetti, Marta; Bachetti, Francesco; Torti, Gabriele; Cadei, Moris; Villanacci, Vincenzo; Baldini, Vittorio; Bassotti, Gabrio",Minerva gastroenterologica e dietologica,465,1

We assessed CRC incidence and mortality by number of previous negative faecal immunochemical tests (FIT) among subjects turning 70. We selected persons aged 70 years who had received their last screening invitation when they were 68 or 69 years old within the population-based screening program in the Veneto region of Italy. Subjects with a positive FIT were excluded. We calculated 10-year cumulative CRC incidence and mortality in cohorts of subjects having performed zero, one, two or three negative FITs over the last three screening rounds before turning 70. Out of 117 858 subjects included in the study (46.4% men), 33.7% had never participated in screening (zero negative FITs), 23.3% had had one-, 20.1% two- and 22.9% three negative FITs. The 10-year cumulative CRC incidence was 29.7 per 1000 subjects with zero FITs, and respectively 14.5, 11.7 and 9.6 per 1000 subjects with one, two and three negative FITs. The corresponding figures for 10-year cumulative mortality were 9.3, 3.5, 2.2 and 2.1 per 1000 in the four study cohorts. Figures were roughly double for men than for women for all the study cohorts. In order to use more efficiently limited endoscopy resources, and to minimize the potential harms related to false positive results in the elderly, screening among people aged 70 to 74 might be restricted to those with zero previous negative FITs.

Despite being mainly a respiratory virus, cardiac complications have been described. These range from sudden cardiac death to subtle diastolic dysfunction after recovery from COVID-19. The commonest cardiac presentation to date is acute heart failure resulting from biventricular or left ventricular hypokinesis and elevation of cardiac troponins. It has been shown that COVID-19 downregulates angiotensin-converting enzyme-2, which has protective effects on the endothelium and cardiomyocytes. It has also been proven that COVID-19 induces a state of hypercytokinaemia, some cytokines such as interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 have an injurious effect on the myocardium and endothelium, respectively. Such pathogenic mechanisms might play a crucial role in induction of cardiomyocyte injury and impaired myocardial perfusion probably through coronary endothelial dysfunction. The understanding and linking of such mechanisms might help in tailoring drug repurposing for treatment or prophylaxis of COVID-19 cardiovascular complications.","AbdelMassih, Antoine Fakhry; Ramzy, David; Nathan, Lauren; Aziz, Silvia; Ashraf, Mirette; Youssef, Nourhan Hatem; Hafez, Nouran; Saeed, Rana; Agha, Hala",Cardiovascular endocrinology & metabolism,465,1

The main etiological factors of AR are pollen of trees, meadow and weeds, as well as mold spores, household allergens and epidermis of animals. Epidemiological studies have found that the prevalence and structure of AR are influenced by regional characteristics, such as the climatic and geographical and social characteristics of the region, and successively therapeutic and preventive algorithms in AR are also different. AIM To examine the phenotype of the incidence of AR in connection with the characteristics of aeroallergens under the influence of climatic and geographical conditions in northern Vietnam, to make a new contribution to knowledge about AR in Asia and to increase the effect of treatment and prevention in this territory. MATERIALS AND RESEARCH METHODS The study was conducted in the period from 06.2018 to 09.2018 on the basis of the ENT department of Thainguyen Central Hospital, Vietnam. A total of 556 patients with pathology of ENT organs aged 18 to 70 years were examined, 158 cases of chronic rhinitis were revealed. Among data from 158 patients, 64 patients were diagnosed with AR. We used otorhinolaryngological examination, a standard specific allergological examination and carried out aeropolyneological research in the city of the northern Vietnam, from 06.2018 to 06.2019. RESULT The aerobiological spectrum is dominated by pollen from the families Moraceae, Urticaceae, Poaceae, Acacia, Artemisia, fern spores and fungal spores from the genus Alternaria. Among patients with chronic rhinitis, 40% were diagnosed with AR, 98.44% of them year-round or perennial AR, with predominant sensitization to house dust mites and molds, much more often to plant pollen. Among 9 (14.06%) patients diagnosed with a polyp of the nasal cavity, 6 (9.37%) patients had increased levels of specific IgE in the blood to a mixture of molds. Sensitization in patients with AR with hypertrophy of the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity is predominant on house dust. CONCLUSION Predominantly, AR in northern Vietnam was year-round. Especially the connection between the formation of a polyp of the nasal cavity and hypersensitivity to fungal spores has been indicated, which may also indicate the role of social factors in further recommendations for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of AR in patients living in North Vietnam.","Kryukov, A I; Bondareva, G P; Severova, E E; Nguyen, T F; Nguyen, K H",Vestnik otorinolaringologii,465,11

According to recent trials, up to 16% of patients require emergency conversion to general anesthesia during mechanical thrombectomy. This study investigated the procedural and clinical outcomes after emergency conversion in comparison with local anesthesia, conscious sedation, and general anesthesia. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study included 254 patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy for acute large-vessel occlusion. The procedure was started with the patient either under local anesthesia, conscious sedation, or general anesthesia. Emergency conversion was defined as induction of general anesthesia during mechanical thrombectomy. The primary outcomes were successful reperfusion (TICI 2b/3) and functional independence (mRS at 90 days, ≤2). RESULTS Twenty-five patients (9.8%) required emergency conversion to general anesthesia. The time from admission to flow restoration was increased under general anesthesia (median, 137 minutes) and emergency conversion (median, 138 minutes) compared with local anesthesia (median 110 minutes). After adjustment for confounders, emergency conversion to general anesthesia and primary general anesthesia had comparable chances of successful reperfusion (OR = 1.28; 95% CI, 0.31-5.25). Patients with emergency conversion had a tendency toward higher chances of functional independence (OR = 4.48; 95% CI, 0.49-40.86) compared with primary general anesthesia, but not compared with local anesthesia (OR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.14-5.11) and conscious sedation (OR = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.17-6.53). CONCLUSIONS Patients with emergency conversion did not have lower chances of successful reperfusion or functional independence compared those with primary general anesthesia, and time to flow restoration was also similar. We found no evidence supporting the primary induction of general anesthesia in patients at risk for emergency conversion.","Flottmann, F; Leischner, H; Broocks, G; Faizy, T D; Aigner, A; Deb-Chatterji, M; Thomalla, G; Krauel, J; Issleib, M; Fiehler, J; Brekenfeld, C",AJNR.

The objective of this study was to examine the survival effect of delay in starting concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) in women with locally-advanced cervical cancer. METHODS This is a retrospective observational study querying the National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2016. Women with stage IB2-IVA squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix who received definitive CCRT with known wait-time for CCRT initiation after cancer diagnosis were eligible (N=13,617). Cox proportional hazard regression model with restricted cubic spline transformation was fitted to assess the association between CCRT wait-time and all-cause mortality in multivariable analysis. RESULTS The median wait-time to start CCRT was 6 (IQR 4-8) weeks. In a multivariable analysis, older age, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic ethnicity, recent year of diagnosis, Medicaid and uninsured status, medical comorbidities, and absence of nodal metastasis were associated with longer CCRT wait-time (P<.05). Women with aggressive tumor factors (poorer differentiation, large tumor size, nodal metastasis, and higher cancer stage) were more likely to have a short CCRT wait-time (P<.05). After controlling for the measured covariates, CCRT wait-time of 6.1-9.8 weeks was not associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality compared to a wait-time of 6 weeks. Similar association was observed when the cohort was stratified by histology, cancer stage, tumor size, or brachytherapy use. CONCLUSION An implication of this study for the current coronavirus pandemic is that in the absence of aggressive tumor factors, a short period of wait-time to start definitive CCRT may not be associated with increased risk of mortality in women with locally-advanced cervical cancer.","Matsuo, Koji; Huang, Yongmei; Matsuzaki, Shinya; Ragab, Omar M; Roman, Lynda D; Wright, Jason D",Gynecologic oncology,465,24

PURPOSE This survey's purpose was to determine how eye care providers responded to the 2008 Centers of Disease Control (CDC) tonometer disinfection guidelines, which recommend 10% hypochlorite (dilute bleach) for reusable tonometers. Tonometers measure the eye pressure when they touch the cornea, an essential part of the eye exam. METHODS American Glaucoma Society (AGS) and American Optometry Association (AOA) members were surveyed on tonometer preference, tonometer use, disinfection process, disinfectants, disinfection timing, and tonometer damage. RESULTS Survey responses from 79 AOA members and 197 AGS members are included. The Goldmann tonometer is considered most accurate (70, 89% AOA and 161, 82% AGS). It is preferred by 54 (70%) AOA and 193 (98%) AGS members. Many providers (165) use reusable Goldmann tonometer tips (77, 79% AOA, 88, 45% AGS), and most clean with 70% isopropyl alcohol wipes 59 (77%) AOA and 54 (61%) AGS. In summary, 126 of 276 participants (8, 10% AOA and 118, 60% AGS) follow CDC guidelines by using disposable tips (2 AOA and 109 AGS) or disinfecting reusable tips with 10% hypochlorite (6 AOA and 9 AGS). CONCLUSION The majority of AGS providers follow current CDC tonometer disinfection guidelines by shifting to disposable Goldmann tonometer tips. Only a minority of providers who use reusable tonometer tips disinfect with dilute bleach. Continued education on proper tonometer disinfection is critical to prevent eye-care related infection due to improper disinfection.","Junk, Anna Katharina; Chang, Ta Chen; Vanner, Elizabeth; Chen, Teresa",Journal of glaucoma,465,22

Typing allows for clustering of cases whose isolates share an identical genotype, revealing epidemiologic relatedness. Observed distributions of genotypic cluster sizes of tuberculosis (TB) are highly skewed. A possible explanation for this skewness is the concept of ""superspreading"": a high heterogeneity in the number of secondary cases caused per infectious individual. Superspreading has been previously found for diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and smallpox, where the entire transmission tree is known. So far, no method exists to relate superspreading to the distribution of genotypic cluster sizes. METHODS We quantified heterogeneity in secondary infections per infectious individual by describing this number as a negative binomial distribution. The dispersion parameter k is a measure of superspreading; standard (homogeneous) models use values of k ≥ 1, whereas small values of k imply superspreading. We estimated this negative binomial dispersion parameter for TB in the Netherlands, using the genotypic cluster size distribution for all 8330 cases of culture confirmed, pulmonary TB diagnosed between 1993 and 2007 in the Netherlands. RESULTS The dispersion parameter k was estimated at 0.10 (95% confidence interval = 0.09-0.12), well in the range of values consistent with superspreading. Simulation studies showed the method reliably estimates the dispersion parameter across a range of scenarios and parameter values. CONCLUSION Heterogeneity in the number of secondary cases caused per infectious individual is a plausible explanation for the observed skewness in genotypic cluster size distribution of TB.","Ypma, Rolf J F; Altes, Hester Korthals; van Soolingen, Dick; Wallinga, Jacco; van Ballegooijen, W Marijn",Epidemiology,465,26

Sirt1 is decreased in obese patients and increased in weight loss. Its decreased expression explains part of the pathomechanisms of the metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DT2), cardiovascular diseases and nonalcoholic liver disease. Sirt1 plays an important role in the differentiation of adipocytes and in insulin signaling regulated by Foxo1 and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Its overexpression attenuates inflammation and macrophage infiltration induced by a high fat diet. Its decreased expression plays a prominent role in the heart, liver and brain of rat as manifestations of fetal programming produced by deficit in vitamin B12 and folate during pregnancy and lactation through imbalanced methylation/acetylation of PGC1α and altered expression and methylation of nuclear receptors. The decreased expression of Sirt1 produced by impaired cellular availability of vitamin B12 results from endoplasmic reticulum stress through subcellular mislocalization of ELAVL1/HuR protein that shuttles Sirt1 mRNA between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Preclinical and clinical studies of Sirt1 agonists have produced contrasted results in the treatment of the metabolic syndrome.

In this paper, we present a wrist-worn strap that includes a 2-D array of 48 miniature electrodes covering the bottom side of the wrist with good contact with the skin. Good skin contact directly impacts the sensing robustness. The array provides local measurements between adjacent electrodes that span the whole bottom side of the wrist with an area of 6.25×4.60 cm for robust sensing. The array allows for the automatic selection of the correct electrodes at the right location regardless of changes in the device placement on the wrist. In addition, using a large number of electrodes over a large area on the wrist ensures continuous contact of some electrodes with the skin during motion since all of the electrodes will not lose contact with the skin at the same time. We measured the electrode-skin impedance of the fabricated electrodes versus frequency and compared to other types of electrodes. We demonstrated good contact between all electrodes of the array and the skin by measuring electrode-skin impedance less than 10 k$\Omega$ at 16 kHz for all locations on the wrist strap. We also conducted measurements of impedance while the wearer was bending the wrist to validate the continuous contact of at least a subset of electrodes with the skin during such movements.","Ibrahim, Bassem; McMurray, Justin; Jafari, And Roozbeh",Conference proceedings : ...

This unique 3' end distinguishes replication-dependent histone mRNAs from all other eukaryotic mRNAs, which end with a poly(A) tail produced by the canonical 3'-end processing mechanism of cleavage and polyadenylation. The pioneering studies of Max Birnstiel's group demonstrated nearly 40 years ago that the unique 3' end of animal replication-dependent histone mRNAs is generated by a distinct processing mechanism, whereby histone mRNA precursors are cleaved downstream of the stem-loop, but this cleavage is not followed by polyadenylation. The key role is played by the U7 snRNP, a complex of a ∼60 nucleotide U7 snRNA and many proteins. Some of these proteins, including the enzymatic component CPSF73, are shared with the canonical cleavage and polyadenylation machinery, justifying the view that the two metazoan pre-mRNA 3'-end processing mechanisms have a common evolutionary origin. The studies on U7 snRNP culminated in the recent breakthrough of reconstituting an entirely recombinant human machinery that is capable of accurately cleaving histone pre-mRNAs, and determining its structure in complex with a pre-mRNA substrate (with 13 proteins and two RNAs) that is poised for the cleavage reaction. The structure uncovered an unanticipated network of interactions within the U7 snRNP and a remarkable mechanism of activating catalytically dormant CPSF73 for the cleavage. This work provides a conceptual framework for understanding other eukaryotic 3'-end processing machineries.","Dominski, Zbigniew; Tong, Liang",Biochemical Society transactions,465,20

Most resident testing occurs via nasopharyngeal swab that potentially causes epistaxis with rates of 5% to 8% in healthy populations. It is estimated that 48% of long-term care residents receive oral anticoagulation that increases risk of bleeding. A long-term care resident receiving oral anticoagulation experienced an episode of acute blood loss anemia after nasopharyngeal sampling. Current medications were not reviewed before testing, and oral anticoagulation was not held resulting in acute blood loss anemia. A medication review is indicated for skilled nursing and assisted living residents to identify oral anticoagulation before nasopharyngeal testing. Less invasive testing may be recommended or should bleeding occur, discontinuation of oral anticoagulation for a short term may be appropriate.","Watkins, April Kathleen; Heinzman, Kristopher M; Kurian, Thomas K; Hong, Mauricio; Clark, Angela P; Champion, Jane Dimmitt",Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,465,1

Effects of PDE5i on post-LVAD outcomes including hemocompatibility-related adverse events (HRAE) are not well established. OBJECTIVE This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effects of PDE5i on post-LVAD outcomes. METHODS A comprehensive literature search was conducted using Pubmed and Embase databases from inception through November 25, 2020 to compare post-LVAD outcomes in patients with or without PDE5i use. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and I2 statistic were calculated. RESULTS Thirteen observational studies were included in this analysis. Use of PDE5i was not significantly associated with lower postoperative RVF (OR 0.38, 95%CI 0.02-5.96, p=0.41). There was no significant association between PDE5i and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (OR 1.23, 95%CI 0.76-1.98, p=0.2), overall stroke (OR 0.60, 95%CI 0.21-1.68, p=0.17), ischemic stroke (OR 0.61, 95%CI 0.09-4.07, p=0.38), and pump thrombosis (OR 0.71, 95%CI 0.14-3.54, p=0.46). CONCLUSIONS Our meta-analysis showed no significant association between PDE5i and post-LVAD RVF. Despite the anti-platelet effects of PDE5i, there was no significant association between PDE5i and GI bleeding, overall stroke, ischemic stroke, and pump thrombosis. Randomized-controlled studies are warranted to evaluate the net benefits or harms of PDE5i in LVAD population.","Kittipibul, Veraprapas; Blumer, Vanessa; Angsubhakorn, Natthapon; Hernandez, Gabriel A; Chaparro, Sandra; Tedford, Ryan J; Agarwal, Richa",Journal of cardiac failure,465,16

METHODS All children who underwent laparoscopic surgery for suspected appendicitis from 2006 to 2014 in a center for pediatric surgery were included in the study. Converted surgeries and patients with appendiceal abscess or concomitant intestinal obstruction were excluded. A total of 259 children underwent appendectomy with either two (35 %) or three (65 %) laparoscopic trocars according to the surgeons' preference and intraoperative judgment. Patient demographics, clinical symptoms, surgery characteristics, and complications were reviewed. RESULTS The mean age of the children was 10.4 years (range, 1-14 years). The mean follow-up time was 41.2 months (SD ± 29.2). No significant differences in age, gender, weight, or signs and symptoms were found between the two- and three-trocar groups. The mean surgery time was significantly shorter in the two-trocar group (47 min) than in the three-trocar group (66 min; p < 0.001). The rates of surgical complications were 2 % vs. 4 %, (p = 0.501), and the rates of postoperative complications were 0 % vs. 5 % (p = 0.054), in the two- and three-trocar groups. The overall incidence of postoperative wound infection was low (<1 %) and did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS Two-trocar laparoscopic appendectomy seems to be a safe and feasible technique with a low rate of postoperative wound infections. The present findings demonstrate that when the two-trocar technique could be applied, it is a good complement to the conventional three-trocar technique.","Salö, Martin; Järbur, Emil; Hambraeus, Mette; Ohlsson, Bodil; Stenström, Pernilla; Arnbjörnsson, Einar",BMC surgery,465,17

Thus, we conducted a prospective analysis of breast cancer risk in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers from age 60 until age 80. METHODS Subjects had no history of cancer and both breasts intact at age 60 (n = 699). Women were followed until a breast cancer diagnosis, prophylactic bilateral mastectomy or death. We calculated the annual cancer rate and cumulative incidence of breast cancer (invasive and in situ) from age 60 to age 80. We assessed the associations between hormone replacement therapy, family history of breast cancer and bilateral oophorectomy and breast cancer risk. RESULTS Over a mean follow-up of 7.9 years, 61 invasive and 20 in situ breast cancers were diagnosed in the cohort. The mean annual rate of invasive breast cancer was 1.8% for BRCA1 mutation carriers and 1.7% for BRCA2 mutation carriers. The cumulative risk of invasive breast cancer from age 60 to 80 was 20.1% for women with a BRCA1 mutation and was 17.3% for women with a BRCA2 mutation. Hormone replacement therapy, family history and oophorectomy were not associated with breast cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS Findings from this large prospective study indicate that the risk of developing breast cancer remains high after age 60 in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. These findings warrant further evaluation of the role of breast cancer screening in older mutation carriers.","Stjepanovic, Neda; Lubinski, Jan; Moller, Pal; Randall Armel, Susan; Foulkes, William D; Tung, Nadine; Neuhausen, Susan L; Kotsopoulos, Joanne; Sun, Ping; Sun, Sophie; Eisen, Andrea; Narod, Steven A",Breast cancer research and treatment,465,16

However, further evidence about how T-cell subsets may be affected in infants during severe RSV bronchiolitis is needed to understand the mechanisms through which immunological memory may be altered. There is increasingly convincing evidence that RSV may be associated with the development of atopy and asthma. Surrogates of Th1, Th2 and regulatory T-lymphocyte populations were measured in blood from children with acute RSV bronchiolitis and in convalescence using the cell surface receptors CXCR3, CCR4 and CD25, respectively. Samples were also obtained from healthy age-matched controls. Plasma levels of the chemokines interferon-γ inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), which are known ligands for CXCR3 and CCR4, were also measured. Free plasma DNA was measured using quantitative PCR. CXCR3-positive cells were significantly decreased during acute infection (p = 0.013), while CCR4 and CD25 T-cell populations were unchanged. Plasma levels of IP-10 were markedly elevated in acute infection (p = 0.001). Convalescent samples were not significantly different to control samples for lymphocyte phenotypes or plasma chemokines. Elevated free plasma DNA was detected during acute infection compared with convalescence and controls. A profound reduction in the Th1, but not Th2, and CD25-positive lymphocyte populations associated with exaggerated IP-10 production occurs in severe RSV bronchiolitis. Free DNA is detectable in plasma. This may allow significant alterations in the generation of T-cell memory.","Roe, Michael F E; Bloxham, David M; Cowburn, Andrew S; O'Donnell, Diarmuid R",Pediatric allergy and immunology : official publication of the European Society of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology,465,12

Its use has been extended to nonruptured and ruptured IAs of a variety of configurations and etiologies in both the anterior and posterior circulations. METHODS We conducted a systematic review of ten eligible reports on its clinical efficacy and safety. RESULTS There were 414 patients with 448 IAs. The majority of the IAs were large (40.2 %), saccular or blister-like (78.3 %), and were located mostly in the anterior circulation (83.5 %). The regimens of antiplatelet therapy varied greatly between and within studies. The mean number of the PED used was 2.0 per IA. Deployment was successful in around 95 % of procedures. Aneurysm obliteration was achieved in 82.9 % of IAs at 6-month. The overall incidences of periprocedural intracranial vascular complication rate and mortality rate were 6.3 and 1.5 %, respectively. CONCLUSION The PED is a safe and effective treatment for nonruptured IAs. Its use in the context of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) should be cautioned. Its main limitations include the need for prolonged antiplatelet therapy, as well as the potential risks of IA rupture and non-IA-related intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH). Future studies should aim at identifying factors that predispose to incomplete obliteration, delayed rupture, and thromboembolic complications.","Leung, G K K; Tsang, A C O; Lui, W M",Clinical neuroradiology,465,24

METHODS In this cross-sectional study, hospitalised patients with confirmed severe COVID-19 in a single referral centre for the treatment of COVID-19, in Santo André, São Paulo Metropolitan Area, Brazil, underwent dilated eye examination of both eyes performed by a retina specialist. Findings were recorded using a portable digital fundus camera. Retinographies were analysed by two retina specialists. Medical records were reviewed for assessment of patient demographics, baseline comorbidities and clinical data. RESULTS There were a total of 18 patients, nine (50%) male, median IQR age of 62.5 (12) years. Ten of the 18 patients (55.6%; 95% CI 33.7 to 75.4) had abnormalities on dilated eye examination. The main findings were flame-shaped haemorrhages (N=4; 22.2%; 95% CI 9.0 to 45.2) and ischaemic pattern lesions (cotton wool spots and retinal sectorial pallor) (N=4; 22.2%; 95% CI 9.0 to 45.2), with one patient having both cotton wool spots and flame-shaped haemorrhages. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 have acute vascular lesions of the inner retina including flame-shaped haemorrhages and cotton wool spots. Further studies controlling for confounding factors are necessary to properly assess these findings so as to increase the understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology and to identify new therapies.","Pereira, Leonardo Amarante; Soares, Larissa Caroline Mansano; Nascimento, Priscila Alves; Cirillo, Luciano Rabello Netto; Sakuma, Hebert Toshiaki; Veiga, Glaucia Luciano da; Fonseca, Fernando Luiz Afonso; Lima, Vagner Loduca; Abucham-Neto, Julio Zaki",The British journal of ophthalmology,465,26

Testing a closed loop system in an inpatient environment with supervised challenges allows for initial evaluation of performance and safety of the system. METHODS Adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) were enrolled into two similar studies (n=10/study), with 3-day inpatient analysis periods. Participants tested a Lilly hybrid closed loop (HCL) system comprised an investigational insulin pump, insulin lispro, a pump-embedded model predictive control algorithm, a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and an external, dedicated controller. Each protocol included meal-related and exercise challenges to simulate real-world diabetes self-management errors. Only study staff interacted with the HCL system. Performance was assessed using standard CGM metrics overall and within prespecified periods. RESULTS Participants (25% male) had mean±SD age 44.7±14.2 years, T1D duration 30.2±11.1 years, A1C 7.2±0.8%, and insulin usage 0.53±0.21 U/kg/day. Percent TIR 70-180 mg/dL (mean±SD) was 81.2±8.4 overall, 85.2±8.1 outside of challenge periods, 97.3±5.3 during the nocturnal periods, and 74.5±16.2 for the postprandial periods. During challenge periods, percent TIR for the over-bolus challenge was 65.4±29.2 and for the delayed bolus challenge was 57.1±25.1. No adverse events, serious adverse events or unanticipated adverse device events occurred while participants were using the HCL system. CONCLUSION In participants with T1D, Lilly AID system demonstrated expected algorithm performance and safety with satisfactory glycemic outcomes overall and in response to simulated diabetes management challenges.

In the control group, eggs were incubated in minimal broth. The number of L1 larvae was ascertained. Each treatment consisted of four repetitions and the experiment was repeated five times. It was observed that the effect of FE and MCE of P. lilacinum and T. virens on egg hatchability differed from that of the control group. MCE of T. virens and P. lilacinum showed higher ovicidal activity than FE over both periods and at 48 hours of exposure, respectively. From the percentage reductions in hatchability of the eggs, MCE was shown to be superior to FE for both fungi. This study demonstrated the ovicidal potential of these fungi against trichostrongylid eggs. However, further studies are needed in order to identify the molecules responsible for the ovicidal effects, and to evaluate the behavior of fungal extracts in biotic and abiotic interactions.","Baptista, Cristiane Telles; Moreira, Andrios da Silva; Maia Filho, Fernando de Souza; Valente, Júlia de Souza Silveira; Pinto, Natália Berne; Trindade Junior, Waldenis Pereira da; Braga, Caroline Quintana; Pötter, Luciana; Pereira, Daniela Isabel Brayer",Revista brasileira de parasitologia veterinaria = Brazilian journal of veterinary parasitology : Orgao Oficial do Colegio Brasileiro de Parasitologia Veterinaria,465,22

The current world- wide pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 virus showed many gaps in understanding of coronaviruses spread and transmission. Because of lack of effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 the only preventive measures are represented by wearing protective masks and gloves thus limiting potential risk of contact with the airborne virus. Inversely, the limited time of protective function of the masks presents another drawback of their use. Therefore, the application of disinfection agent dispersed on the surface of protective masks may enhance their effectivity and safety of their application. The aim of the study was to examine the virucidal efficacy of low-concentra- ted sodium hypochlorite dispersed using ultrasonic humidifier on the surface of surgery masks. The study was conducted using SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus, namely porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) representing a model with similar biophysical properties and genomic structure to human coronaviruses. Five different concentrations of the disinfectant with different content of sodium hypochlorite were selected for the study. A final concentration of 0.228 g/L sodium hypochlorite effectively inactivated the PED virus and may support the biosafety of masks usage.","Antas, M; Szczotka-Bochniarz, A; Woźniakowski, G",Polish journal of veterinary sciences,465,31

Emergency Departments (EDs) function as the safety nets of the American healthcare system, caring for many vulnerable populations. ED-based interventions to assess social risk and mitigate social needs have been reported in the literature. However, the breadth and scope of these interventions have not been evaluated. As the field of Social Emergency Medicine expands, a mapping and categorization of previous interventions may help shape future research. OBJECTIVE We sought to identify, summarize, and characterize ED-based interventions aimed at mitigating negative SDoH. METHODS We conducted a scoping review to identify and characterize peer-reviewed research articles that report ED-based interventions to address or impact SDoH in the US. We designed and conducted a search in Medline, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases. Abstracts and subsequently, full manuscripts, were reviewed independently by two reviewers to identify potentially relevant articles. Included articles were categorized by type of intervention and primary SDoH domain. Reported outcomes were also categorized by type and efficacy. RESULTS A total of 10,856 abstracts were identified and reviewed, and 596 potentially relevant studies were identified. Full manuscript review identified 135 articles for inclusion. These articles were further subdivided into three intervention types: a) Provider Educational Intervention (18%), b) Disease Modification with SDoH Focus (26%), and c) Direct SDoH intervention (60%), with 4% including two 'types.' Articles were subsequently further grouped into seven SDoH domains: 1) Access to Care (33%), 2) Discrimination/Group Disparities (7%), 3) Exposure to Violence/Crime (34%), 4) Food Insecurity (2%), 5) Housing Issues/Homelessness (3%), 6) Language/Literacy/Health literacy (12%); 7) Socioeconomic Disparities/Poverty (10%). The majority of articles reported that the intervention studied was effective for the primary outcome identified (78%). CONCLUSION ED-based interventions that address seven different SDoH domains have been reported in the peer-reviewed literature over the past thirty years, utilizing a variety of approaches including provider education and direct and indirect focus on social risk and need. Characterization and understanding of previous interventions may help identify opportunities for future interventions as well as guide a Social Emergency Medicine research agenda.","Walter, Lauren A; Schoenfeld, Elizabeth M; Smith, Catherine H; Shufflebarger, Erin; Khoury, Charles; Baldwin, Katherine; Hess, Jennifer; Heimann, Matthew; Crosby, Cameron; Sontheimer, Sylvia Y; Gragg, Stephen; Hand, Delissa; McIlwain, Joseph; Greene, Christopher; Skains, Rachel M; Hess, Erik P",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,465,1

There are various methods of treatment for angina. Lifestyle modification and pharmacological management are considered as conservative treatments. If these medications do not result in the resolution of pain, more invasive approaches are an option, like coronary revascularization. Refractory angina (RA) is differentiated from acute or chronic angina based on the persistence of symptoms despite conventional therapies. Overall, the prevalence of RA is estimated to be 5%-15% in patients with coronary artery disease, which can account for up to 1,500,000 current cases and 100,000 new cases in the United States per year.

Barriers to their involvement include limited access to data. The objective of our study was to create a data dashboard using an existing quality improvement (QI) infrastructure and provide resident access to data to facilitate exploratory analysis on disparities in emergency department (ED) patient care. Methods Focusing on patient populations that have previously been shown in the literature to suffer significant disparities in the ED, we extracted outcomes across a variety of metrics already collected as part of routine ED operations. Using data visualization software, we developed an interactive dashboard for visual exploratory analyses. Results We designed a dashboard for our resident learners with views that are flexible and allow user selected filters to view clinical outcomes by patient age, treatment area, and chief complaint. Learners were also allowed to select grouping and outcomes of interest to investigate questions and form new hypotheses of their choosing. Available dashboard views included summary counts view to assess ED visits over time by selectable group, a rooming and triage acuity view, time-to-event survival curve view, histogram and box plot views for continuous variables, a view to assess outcome variables by time of day of ED arrival, customizable contingency table views, and correspondence analysis. Conclusions Utilizing an existing QI infrastructure, we developed a dashboard that provides a new perspective into commonly collected ED operations data to allow for the exploration of disparities in ED care that is accessible to learners. Future directions include using these data to refine hypotheses on ED disparities, understand root causes, develop interventions, and measure their impact.","Tsuchida, Ryan E; Haggins, Adrianne N; Perry, Marcia; Chen, Chiu-Mei; Medlin, Richard P; Meurer, William J; Burkhardt, John; Fung, Christopher M",AEM education and training,465,26

Initial studies describe an impact of preinterventional clot migration on technical and clinical success of thrombectomy and an association with worse clinical outcome. We, therefore, performed a large study of consecutive patients whose clots have been histologically analyzed and tried to determine whether clot composition influences the rates of clot migration and thereby interventional and clinical outcome. Methods- We retrospectively evaluated data of a prospectively collected cohort of 198 consecutive patients with occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. We investigated the relationship between clot histology expressed as percentage of the main components (fibrin, erythrocytes [red blood cell], and white blood cells), the preinterventional computed tomography attenuation of the emboli, embolus length, and clot migration. We defined a binary outcome (clot migration versus no clot migration). The impact of embolus composition and computed tomography features was assessed in univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. Results- One hundred sixty-three patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of which 36 (22.1%) showed a clot migration. Patients with proven clot migration had significantly higher levels of red blood cells than patients without clot migration (median 50% versus 26%, P<0.001). Lower amounts of fibrin were significantly more often observed in patients in the clot migration group as compared to the no clot migration group (43.5% versus 62.0%, P<0.001). Stroke cause did not differ between migrated and stable emboli. Multivariable analysis identified a higher amount of erythrocytes (adjusted odds ratio, 1.03 per median percentage, P<0.001) and a shorter embolus length (adjusted odds ratio, 0.90 per mm, P<0.008) as independent predictors of clot migration. Conclusions- Erythrocyte-rich clots and a shorter embolus length are independent reliable predictors for clot migration. This finding is clinically important as clot migration might have a negative impact on technical and clinical outcomes of patients suffering from emergent vessel occlusions of the middle cerebral artery undergoing endovascular therapy.","Sporns, Peter B; Jeibmann, Astrid; Minnerup, Jens; Broocks, Gabriel; Nawabi, Jawed; Schön, Gerhard; Fiehler, Jens; Wildgruber, Moritz; Heindel, Walter; Kemmling, André; Hanning, Uta",Stroke,465,12

Inhibition of this vital proteolytic process is effective in preventing the virus from replication in infected cells and therefore provides a potential COVID-19 treatment option. Guided by previous medicinal chemistry studies about SARS-CoV-1 main protease (SC1M Pro ), we have designed and synthesized a series of SC2M Pro inhibitors that contain β-(S-2-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl)-alaninal (Opal) for the formation of a reversible covalent bond with the SC2M Pro active site cysteine C145. All inhibitors display high potency with IC 50 values at or below 100 nM. The most potent compound MPI3 has as an IC 50 value as 8.5 nM. Crystallographic analyses of SC2M Pro bound to 7 inhibitors indicated both formation of a covalent bond with C145 and structural rearrangement from the apoenzyme to accommodate the inhibitors. Virus inhibition assays revealed that several inhibitors have high potency in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathogenic effect in both Vero E6 and ACE2 + A549 cells. Two inhibitors MP5 and MPI8 completely prevented the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytopathogenic effect in Vero E6 cells at 2.5-5 µM and ACE2 + A549 cells at 0.16-0.31 µM.","Liu, Wenshe; Yang, Kai; Ma, Xinyu; Ma, Yuying; Alugubelli, Yugendar; Scott, Danielle; Vatansever, Erol; Drelich, Aleksandra; Sankaran, Banumathi; Geng, Zhi; Blankenship, Lauren; Ward, Hannah; Sheng, Yan; Hsu, Jason; Kratch, Kaci; Zhao, Baoyu; Hayatshahi, Hamed; Liu, Jin; Li, Pingwei; Fierke, Carol; Tseng, Chien-Te; Xu, Shiqing",ChemMedChem,465,1

METHODS Robotic-assisted ileovesicostomy was performed using a 5-port approach for patients with a neurogenic bladder unable to tolerate clean intermittent or chronic bladder catheterization. Intraperitoneal operative steps included the creation of a full thickness U-shaped posterior bladder wall flap, intracorporeal harvesting of 15 cm of terminal ileum for use as a urinary conduit, and intracorporeal enterovesical anastomosis. Then, a counter incision was made over the marked stoma site on the abdominal wall, and bowel continuity was restored through an extracorporeal side-side anastomosis by the stomal incision. Ileovesicostomy stoma maturation was then completed. RESULTS Eight robotic ileovesicostomies were performed. The median patient age was 53 years, body mass index was 29.0 kg/m(2), and preoperative bladder compliance was 5.7 mL/cm/H(2)O. The median blood loss was 100 mL. The median operative time was 330 minutes (range 240-420). No intraoperative complications occurred. Four patients had postoperative complications, including urethral incontinence (2) and ileus (2). No wound complications occurred. Bowel function returned after a median of 4.8 days after surgery, and median hospital stay was 7.7 days. Over a median 14-month follow-up, all patients had a functioning ileovesicostomy, and median postoperative residual bladder volume was 10 mL.

LDH can be elevated in many pathological conditions. We have observed serum LDH to be increased in patients with chronic cough. We wanted to confirm this finding, study the reproducibility and determine the origin of the LDH. METHODS Patients prospectively seen at the Hull Cough Clinic had total and specific LDH isoenzyme levels in serum determined. A subgroup of patients also had a serum creatine phosphokinase (CK) measured. Patients completed cough symptom scores and the Hull Airway Reflux Questionnaire (HARQ). Spirometry was performed. RESULTS Eighty-three patients were included. Forty-two percent had LDH values above the reference range and 78% had LDH values in the fourth quartile of the reference range or above. This increase in LDH was predominantly because of a rise in isoenzymes 4 and 5. The increase in LDH was found to be reproducible at 8 weeks. Ten percent had CK values above the normal range. There was no correlation observed between LDH values and the cough scores, HARQ scores or lung function. CONCLUSION Serum LDH levels are elevated in a substantial proportion of patients with chronic cough. This rise is likely to be due to airway inflammation known to be associated with chronic cough.","Faruqi, Shoaib; Wilmot, Rachel; Wright, Caroline; Morice, Alyn Hugh",The clinical respiratory journal,465,33

Catfish IL-22 produced at significant yield and purity highlights the use of plants as a promising production platform for therapeutic proteins with utility to the aquaculture industry. Purified cfIL-22 shows similar in vitro bioactivity to its mammalian homolog that include increased proliferation of catfish cells highlighting the tissue preservation capabilities associated with this protein. Recombinant cfIL-22 also upregulated expression of genes encoding a tissue repair protein, fibronectin, an antimicrobial peptide, Natural killer lysin-1, and a common innate immune protein, interferon.

OBJECTIVES We aimed to evaluate successful catheter salvage rates in patients on home parenteral nutrition (HPN). METHODS Studies were retrieved from medical databases, conference proceedings, and article reference lists. Data were collected relating to clinical outcomes of 3 treatments: systemic antibiotics, antimicrobial lock therapy (ALT), and catheter exchange. ORs and 95% CIs were calculated from a mixed logistic effects model. RESULTS From 10,036 identified publications, 28 met the inclusion criteria (22 cohort studies, 5 case-control studies, and 1 randomized clinical trial), resulting in a total of 4911 CRBSIs. To achieve successful catheter salvage, the addition of an antimicrobial lock solution was superior to systemic antibiotics alone (OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.21, 2.53; P = 0.003). Recurrence of infection was less common in studies that used ALT than in those that used systemic antibiotics alone (OR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.61; P = 0.002). The catheter exchange group was excluded from multilevel regression analysis because only 1 included study applied this treatment. Successful salvage rates were highest for coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by Gram-negative rods and Staphylococcus aureus . CONCLUSIONS The addition of an antimicrobial lock solution seems beneficial for successful catheter salvage in HPN-dependent patients with a CRBSI. Future prospective randomized studies should identify the most effective and pathogen-specific strategy.This review was registered at www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO as CRD42018102959.","Gompelman, Michelle; Paus, Carmen; Bond, Ashley; Akkermans, Reinier P; Bleeker-Rovers, Chantal P; Lal, Simon; Wanten, Geert J A",The American journal of clinical nutrition,465,1

However, it is currently difficult to establish the upper uterine weight limit for successful performance of a laparoscopic hysterectomy. CASE PRESENTATION Here we report the case of a TLH performed for a very large fibromatous uteri weighing 5320 g in a 40-year-old Caucasian woman. The surgery had no complications with an operating time of approximately 220 min. The patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 3 in very good condition. To our knowledge, the present paper is the only to describe a uterus of this size removed by laparoscopic hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS Our case demonstrates that uterine size is not a determinant for a final surgical decision to use laparoscopic hysterectomy. Therefore, if not contraindicated by the patient's comorbidities or peculiar anatomical conditions, we believe that laparoscopic hysterectomy could be performed in the presence of large uteri without hypothetical weight limits.","Macciò, Antonio; Kotsonis, Paraskevas; Lavra, Fabrizio; Chiappe, Giacomo; Sanna, Daniela; Zamboni, Fausto; Madeddu, Clelia",BMC surgery,465,1

While the coronavirus (CoV) spike (S) protein is known to be cleaved at the S1/S2 boundary, this cleavage site is not closely linked to a fusion peptide. However, a second cleavage site has been identified in the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) S2 domain (R797). Here, we investigated whether this internal cleavage of S2 exposes a viral fusion peptide. We show that the residues immediately C-terminal to the SARS-CoV S2 cleavage site SFIEDLLFNKVTLADAGF are very highly conserved across all CoVs. Mutagenesis studies of these residues in SARS-CoV S, followed by cell-cell fusion and pseudotyped virion infectivity assays, showed a critical role for residues L803, L804, and F805 in membrane fusion. Mutation of the most N-terminal residue (S798) had little or no effect on membrane fusion. Biochemical analyses of synthetic peptides corresponding to the proposed S2 fusion peptide also showed an important role for this region in membrane fusion and indicated the presence of alpha-helical structure. We propose that proteolytic cleavage within S2 exposes a novel internal fusion peptide for SARS-CoV S, which may be conserved across the Coronaviridae.","Madu, Ikenna G; Roth, Shoshannah L; Belouzard, Sandrine; Whittaker, Gary R",Journal of virology,465,0

Herein, a low-cost and eco-friendly separation layer with a rough structure and rich anionic groups was fabricated from rice straw (RS) via a simple acid-base treatment and slight squeeze process. The separation layer's morphology, composition, and wettability were investigated. It was then employed to separate oil-in-water emulsion. The RS after acid and alkali treatment (A1A2-RS) exhibited a clear fiber structure and abundant humps, which made the separation layer superwettable and highly electronegative (-26.55 mV). The overlapped and intertwined A1A2-RS layer structure owned a superior performance for hexadecyl-trimethyl-ammonium-bromide (CTAB) adsorption and tiny oil interception. As a result, the separation layer had stable fluxes (>500 LMH) for multiple CTAB-stabilized emulsions and the obtained filtrates performed low total organic carbon (TOC) contents (<30 mg/L). In addition, the A1A2-RS layer had excellent renewability (10 cycles/ 200 mL) and the flux could be substantially recovered merely by aqueous wash. Moreover, filtrate analysis showed that the A1A2-RS layer had a good effect on actual emulsion treatment with a TOC removal rate of 89.56%.","Feng, Lidong; Gao, Yue; Dai, Zhenguo; Dan, Hongbing; Xiao, Fang; Yue, Qinyan; Gao, Baoyu; Wang, Shuguang",Journal of hazardous materials,465,8

The objective of this study was to prioritize the introduction of new vaccines in Indonesia. METHODS A multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) was applied in this study. A preliminary data collection form was developed to collect country-specific data in relation to 30 pre-defined attributes. In particular, an open-ended questionnaire was conducted among targeted respondents from global level, national level and vaccine manufacturers, which were involved in the financial flows of new vaccine procurement in Indonesia. For setting new vaccines priorities, targeted respondents were asked to assign weight on 10 selected criteria. RESULTS Top 3 attributes with the highest weight from respondents were premature deaths averted per year, incidents cases prevented per year, and cost-effectiveness. Applying criteria scores and weight assessment, the result showed that PCV, rotavirus, HPV, and JE would be on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th rank for setting new vaccine priority in Indonesia. There was a significant difference score (p value <0.05) between all these vaccines. CONCLUSIONS PCV, rotavirus and HPV vaccines should be more prioritized than JE vaccine. This ranking is in line with the WHO's priority list, potentially illustrating the validity and usefulness of our MCDA-approach.","Suwantika, Auliya A; Purwadi, Febby V; Zakiyah, Neily; Puspitasari, Irma M; Abdulah, Rizky; Diantini, Ajeng; Boersma, Cornelis; Postma, Maarten J",Expert review of vaccines,465,1

Plasmonic nanomaterials offer a great opportunity to tune the functionality of enzymes, through their remarkable optical properties. Localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) can be used to modify chemical transformations at the nanomaterial's surface, upon light irradiation. Incident light can promote energetic processes, which may be related to an increase of local temperature (photothermal effects), but also to effects triggered by generated hot-spots or hot-electrons (photoelectronic effects). As a consequence, light irradiation of the protein-nanomaterial interface affects enzyme functionality. To harness these effects to finely and remotely regulate enzyme activity, the physicochemical features of the nanomaterial, properties of the incident light and parameters governing molecular interactions must be optimized. In this perspective article, we discuss relevant examples that illustrate the use of plasmonic nanoparticles to control enzyme function through LSPR excitation. Finally, we also highlight the importance of expanding the use of plasmonic nanomaterials to the immobilization of multi-enzyme systems for light-driven regulation of cell-free biosynthetic pathways. Although this concept is living its infancy, we encourage the scientific community to advance in the development of novel light-controlled biocatalytic plasmonic nanoconjugates and explore their application in biosensing, applied biocatalysis, and biomedicine.","Ribeiro de Barros, Heloise; Lopez-Gallego, Fernando; Liz-Marzán, Luis M",Biochemistry,465,20

METHODS Based on the reference sequences of S protein, physical and chemical properties, hydrophobicity, signal peptide, transmembrane region, domain, secondary structure, tertiary structure analysis and antigenic epitopes prediction were carried out. Meanwhile, the tissue expression, related pathways and reactome pathways of angiotensis Ⅰ converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and C-type lectin domain family 4 member M (CLEC4M) receptors were analyzed. RESULTS The amino acid sequence of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV has a 75.80% consistency. The structural characteristics of the two coronaviruses are highly consistent, but the secondary structure and tertiary structure of SARS-CoV-2 is not as obvious as SARS-CoV. ACE2 and CLEC4M are expressed in alimentary system, heart, kidney, lung and placenta. The main related the pathways of renin-angiotensin system, protein digestion and absorption pathway, and the reactome pathways of metabolism of angiotensinogen to angiotensins, GPCR ligand binding, are related to typical symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 induced by SARS-CoV-2. Three pairs of highly or completely homologous epitopes of S protein were obtained. The 600-605, 695-703 and 888-896 amino acid residues in SARS-CoV-2 were highly homologous with 586-591, 677-685 and 870-878 amino acid residues in SARS-CoV, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The similarity of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV determines that they have similar infection patterns and clinical manifestations.

In addition to -the commonly used conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy single incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy is getting more and more attention. Despite many works and studies comparing these methods, there is still a shortage of results assessing efficiency of this new surgical technique. The aim of the study was to evaluate cost-effectiveness of this method in Polish financial reality. We have analyzed costs of three different surgical techniques: conventional (multi- incision) laparoscopic cholecystectomy, SILC and 'no-port' SILC. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective study that compared three groups of patients who underwent treatment with conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n=20), SILC (n=20) and no-port SILC (n=20). These groups were matched by age, sex and BMI. Following parameters were analyzed: complication rate, operative time, operative costs, length of hospital stay, hospitalization costs. The SILC cases were performed with one of the three-trocar SILC ports available on the market. The 'no- port' SILC cases were performed by single skin incision in the umbilicus, insertion of one 10 mm trocar for the operating instrument, another instrument and scope were inserted directly thorough small incisions in the aponeurosis without a dedicated port RESULTS The average operative cost was significantly higher in the SILC group comparing to the conventional laparoscopy group and the no-port SILC group. There was no significant difference in complication rate, operative time, length of hospital stay, or hospitalization costs between the three groups CONCLUSIONS Currently the cost of the dedicated SILC port does not allow a regular use of this procedure in Polish financial reality. According to our experience improved cosmesis is the only advantage of the single incision laparoscopy, therefore we believe that it is reasonable to consider this technique in a a very selected group of patients.","Matyja, Maciej; Strzałka, Marcin; Zychowicz, Anna; Kołodziej, Damian; Rembiasz, Kazimierz; Budzyński, Andrzej",Polski przeglad chirurgiczny,465,27

The RapidAI mobile application (Rapid Mobile App) provides quick access to perfusion and vessel imaging in patients with LVOs. We hypothesize that utilization of RapidAI mobile application can significantly reduce treatment times in stroke care by accelerating the process of mobilizing stroke clinicians and interventionalists. METHODS We analyzed patients presenting with LVOs between June 2019 and October 2020. Thirty-one patients were treated between June 2019 and March 2020 (pre-app group). Thirty-three patients presented between March 2020 and October 2020 (post-app group). Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to examine variables that are not normally distributed. In a secondary analysis we analyzed interhospital time metrics between primary stroke centers and our comprehensive stroke center. RESULTS Baseline demographic and vascular risk factors were similar in both groups. Use of Rapid Mobile App resulted in 33 min reduction in DGPT (P=0.02), 35 min reduction in door to first pass time (P=0.02), and 37 min reduction in door to recanalization time (P=0.02) in univariate analyses when compared with patients treated pre-app. In a multiple linear regression model, utilization of Rapid Mobile App significantly predicted shorter DGPT (P=0.002). In an adjusted model, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) 24 hours after procedure and at discharge were significantly lower in the post-app group (P=0.03). Time of transfer between primary and comprehensive stroke center was comparable in both groups (P=0.26).

Newer methodologies have begun to demonstrate the underlying physiological changes and elucidate the mechanism of action. We postulated that systematic, CT-based assessment of the response of individual airways to BT is feasible, and our aim was to determine the distribution of these responses and the relationship with airway size. Twenty patients meeting the ERS/ATS definition of severe asthma underwent BT and assessment including CT, Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), and spirometry. Treatment was structured so that the left and right lungs are treated sequentially with a mid-treatment assessment providing an internal control. Pairs of CT scans were analysed using a new semi-automatic processing algorithm which matched individual segmented airways for quantitative comparison. Cross-sectional airway lumen area from matched airway pairs in treated lungs increased on average by 6.4% after BT (p<0.02) but showed no change in the untreated lung. Matched airway length was also unchanged. Breakdown by airway size showed amplified response in more distal airways, with the smallest quintile of measured airways dilating by 13.2% (p<0.001). ACQ improved from 3.5±0.9 to 1.9±1.2 (p<0.001). These data show that the response to BT in individual airways can be assessed by CT and that dilation is heterogeneous and predominant in distal compared with proximal airways.

It has been proposed that the environmental and immune pressures associated with different contexts of infection have different consequences for the associated bacterial populations, affecting drug susceptibility and the emergence of resistance. However, there is little concrete evidence for this model. We prospectively collected sputum samples from 18 newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve patients with tuberculosis and sequenced 795 colony-derived Mtb isolates. Mutant accumulation rates varied considerably between different bacilli isolated from the same individual, and where high rates of mutation were observed, the mutational spectrum was consistent with reactive oxygen species-induced mutagenesis. Elevated bacterial mutation rates were identified in isolates from HIV-negative but not HIV-positive individuals, suggesting that they were immune-driven. These results support the model that mutagenesis of Mtb in vivo is modulated by the host environment, which could drive the emergence of variants associated with drug resistance in a host-dependent manner.","Liu, Qingyun; Wei, Jianhao; Li, Yawei; Wang, Mei; Su, Jun; Lu, Yonghui; López, Mariana G; Qian, Xueqin; Zhu, Zhaoqin; Wang, Haiying; Gan, Mingyun; Jiang, Qi; Fu, Yun-Xin; Takiff, Howard E; Comas, Iñaki; Li, Feng; Lu, Xuemei; Fortune, Sarah M; Gao, Qian",Science advances,465,17

Recently, it was reported to exert a renoprotective effect in the HK-2 cells and kidneys of diabetic rats, which was induced by one type of GLP-1 analogues liraglutide in the presence of high glucose. However, most of the previous findings mainly focused on its indirect effect in inhibiting the advanced glycation end products. Here, besides glycemic control, we also demonstrated a stimulatory role of liraglutide in promoting autophagy and relieving oxidative stress in Zucker diabetic fatty(ZDF) rats. The renoprotective effect of liraglutide has been demonstrated by significantly decreasing urinary albumin (P<0.01) and ameliorating renal pathological changes (P<0.001) in vivo. Besides that, proliferation of Hkc8 and HEK293 cells have been increased after treating with exendin-4, a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Moreover, the GLP-1 could positively improve the progression of autophagy in vivo and in vitro through regulating the autophagy-related protein LC3 and P62 via AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. Simultaneously, it could reverse Nrf2 translocation into the nuclei, then suppress oxidative stress. In terms of mechanism, the renoprotective effect of the GLP-1 would be exerted via the GLP1R-AMPK-mTOR-autophagy-ROS signaling axis. The present study not only illustrates the renoprotective effect of the GLP-1 in DKD rats but also in the first time elucidates the underlying mechanism that is independent of controlling glucose, which implies that the GLP-1 might be a novel therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of DKD.","Yang, Shuangli; Lin, Chuman; Zhuo, Xiaoyun; Wang, Jiyu; Rao, Shitao; Xu, Wen; Cheng, Yanzhen; Yang, Li",American journal of physiology.

However, its shortcomings such as broad torque ripple and variable switching frequency have offered several improvements like Space Vector Modulation (SVM) strategy, multilevel inverter (MLI) topology, etc. The conventional DTC which is fed by the two-level inverter has limited voltage vector, results in some difficulties to optimize the operation, especially at low operating speed. In contrast to MLI, the abundant of voltage vector has provided various amplitudes and angles that can overcome the problem of conventional DTC. Thus, this paper introduces the selected optimal voltage vector obtained from five-level Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) inverter that employs in DTC hysteresis-based to achieve better optimization that similar to the DTC-SVM. Initially, the research work begins with an investigation on the performance comparison between a DTC hysteresis-based between two-level inverter (conventional method) and a five-level CHB inverter (proposed method). Here, a DC generator acted as a load is employed to control the operating speed instead of the speed controller (speed controller is negligible). Hence, the DTC method is optimized by minimizing the torque ripple as well as retaining the torque control capability at constant torque region on several operating speed. The selected optimal vector from the look-up table DTC of five-level CHB inverter must be dynamically appropriate to any change of torque (increased or decreased torque). For simplicity, this paper will only discuss the experimental results for both topologies of drive system. From the experimental results, it is verified that the torque ripples by the proposed method have achieved 10% and 50% reduction at high and low operating speed respectively. It is found that the DTC hysteresis-based result simpler control method than DTC-SVM while maintaining similar output performance.","Tarusan, Siti Azura Ahmad; Jidin, Auzani; Jamil, Mohd Luqman Mohd",ISA transactions,465,29

There are only few works targeted pathological x-ray images. Most of the works targeted only single disease detection which is not good enough. Some works have provided for all classes however the results suffer due to lack of data for rare classes and data unbalancing problem. METHODS Due to arise of COVID-19 virus medical facilities of many countries are overwhelmed and there is a need of intelligent system to detect it. There have been few works regarding detection of the coronavirus but there are many cases where it can be misclassified as some techniques do not provide any goodness if it can only identify type of diseases and ignore the rest. This work is a deep learning-based model to distinguish between cases of COVID-19 from other chest diseases which is need of today. RESULTS A Deep Neural Network model provides a significant contribution in terms of detecting COVID-19 and provide effective analysis of chest related diseases with respect to age and gender. Our model achieves 87% accuracy in terms of Gan based synthetic data and four different types of deep learning- based models which provided state of the art comparable results. CONCLUSION If the gap in identifying of all viral pneumonias is not filled with effective automation of chest disease detection the healthcare industry may have to bear unfavorable circumstances.,"Albahli, Saleh",Current medical imaging,465,1

Curcumin, the most active ingredient of Curcuma longa with a variety of biological activities, has wide effects on the body system. The study is aimed at exploring the potential therapeutic targets underlying the effect of curcumin on SLE-ONFH by utilizing a network pharmacology approach and molecular docking strategy. Methods Curcumin and its drug targets were identified using network analysis. First, the Swiss target prediction, GeneCards, and OMIM databases were mined for information relevant to the prediction of curcumin targets and SLE-ONFH-related targets. Second, the curcumin target gene, SLE-ONFH shared gene, and curcumin-SLE-ONFH target gene networks were created in Cytoscape software followed by collecting the candidate targets of each component by R software. Third, the targets and enriched pathways were examined by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Eventually, a gene-pathway network was constructed and visualized by Cytoscape software; key potential central targets were verified and checked by molecular docking and literature review. Results 201 potential targets of curcumin and 170 related targets involved in SLE-ONFH were subjected to network analysis, and the 36 intersection targets indicated the potential targets of curcumin for the treatment of SLE-ONFH. Additionally, for getting more comprehensive and accurate candidate genes, the 36 potential targets were determined to be analyzed by network topology and 285 candidate genes were obtained finally. The top 20 biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions were identified, when corrected by a P value ≤ 0.05. 20 related signaling pathways were identified by KEGG analysis, when corrected according to a Bonferroni P value ≤ 0.05. Molecular docking showed that the top three genes (TP53, IL6, VEGFA) have good binding force with curcumin; combined with literature review, some other genes such as TNF, CCND1, CASP3, and MMP9 were also identified. Conclusion The present study explored the potential targets and signaling pathways of curcumin against SLE-ONFH, which could provide a better understanding of its effects in terms of regulating cell cycle, angiogenesis, immunosuppression, inflammation, and bone destruction.","Kang, Pan; Wu, Zhiming; Zhong, Yue; Wang, Zihao; Zhou, Chi; Huo, Shaochuan; Guo, Hai; Li, Songtao; Xu, Kun; Liu, Lingyun; Chen, Shuai; Tang, Hongyu; Wang, Haibin",BioMed research international,465,19

Our study had two objectives: (1) characterizing LBMs in Mali with a focus on practices influencing the risk of transmission of AI and ND, and (2) identifying which LBMs should be targeted for surveillance and control based on properties of the live poultry trade network. Two surveys were conducted in 2009-2010: a descriptive study in all 96 LBMs of an area encompassing approximately 98% of the Malian poultry population and a network analysis study in Sikasso county, the main poultry supplying county for the capital city Bamako. Regarding LBMs' characteristics, risk factors for the presence of AI and ND viruses (being open every day, more than 2 days before a bird is sold, absence of zoning to segregate poultry-related work flow areas, waste removal or cleaning and disinfecting less frequently than on a daily basis, trash disposal of dead birds and absence of manure processing) were present in 80-100% of the LBMs. Furthermore, LBMs tended to have wide catchment areas because of consumers' preference for village poultry meat, thereby involving a large number of villages in their supply chain. In the poultry trade network from/to Sikasso county, 182 traders were involved and 685 links were recorded among 159 locations. The network had a heterogeneous degree distribution and four hubs were identified based on measures of in-degrees, out-degrees and betweenness: the markets of Medine and Wayerma and the fairs of Farakala and Niena. These results can be used to design biosecurity-improvement interventions and to optimize the prevention, surveillance and control of transmissible poultry diseases in Malian LBMs. Further studies should investigate potential drivers (seasonality, prices) of the poultry trade network and the acceptability of biosecurity and behavior-change recommendations in the Malian socio-cultural context.","Molia, Sophie; Boly, Ismaël Ardho; Duboz, Raphaël; Coulibaly, Boubacar; Guitian, Javier; Grosbois, Vladimir; Fournié, Guillaume; Pfeiffer, Dirk Udo",Acta tropica,465,31

The patients were divided into two groups according to the ACEF score with an optimum cut-off value of 1.283 who were divided into two groups according to the ACEF score: low ACEF (≤1.283, n:382) and high ACEF (>1.283, n: 276). The primary outcome of the study was in-hospital all-cause mortality. The primary outcome of the study was in-hospital all-cause mortality. Statistically accuracy was defined with area under the curve by receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis.Results In total, 13 (4.71 %) patients had in-hospital mortality. The ACEF score was significantly higher in the group with higher mortality than in the group with low mortality (2.1±0.53 vs. 1.34±0.56 p=0.001). The ACEF score was positively correlated with GRACE risk score (r=0.188 p<0.0001). In ROC curve analysis, the AUC of the ACEF score for predicting in-hospital mortality was 0.849 (95 % CI, 0.820 to 0.876; p<0.0001); sensitivity, 92.3 %; specificity, 59.2 %, and the optimum cut-off value was >1.283.Conclusion The ACEF score presented excellent discrimination in predicting in-hospital mortality. We obtained an easier and more useful result by dividing the ACEF score into two groups instead of three in NSTE-ACS patients. As a simple, useful, and easily applicable risk stratification in the evaluation of an emergency event such as the ACEF score, it can significantly contribute to the identification of patients at high risk.","Demirtas Inci, Saadet; Tekindal, Mustafa Agah",Kardiologiia,465,16

METHODS In this longitudinal study, we sought to assess the durability of rubella virus (RV)-specific humoral immunity in a healthy population (n = 98) of adolescents and young adults at two timepoints: ~7 and ~17 years after two doses of MMR-II® vaccination. Levels of circulating antibodies specific to RV were measured by ELISA and an immune-colorimetric neutralization assay. RV-specific memory B cell responses were also measured by ELISpot. RESULTS Rubella-specific IgG antibody titers, neutralizing antibody titers, and memory B cell responses declined with increasing time since vaccination; however, these decreases were relatively moderate. Memory B cell responses exhibited a greater decline in men compared to women. CONCLUSIONS Collectively, rubella-specific humoral immunity declines following vaccination, although subjects' antibody titers remain well above the currently recognized threshold for protective immunity. Clinical correlates of protection based on neutralizing antibody titer and memory B cell ELISpot response should be defined.","Crooke, Stephen N; Riggenbach, Marguerite M; Ovsyannikova, Inna G; Warner, Nathaniel D; Chen, Min-Hsin; Hao, Lijuan; Icenogle, Joseph P; Poland, Gregory A; Kennedy, Richard B",Vaccine,465,1

Our objective is to describe coagulation parameters in these patients that could be involved in a hypercoagulate state and to test platelet function to see if there are short closure times. We analyzed coagulation samples from 80 patients admitted with COVID-19 in our hospital. We also tested platelet function by closure times in a small subgroup of patients. Most of samples had increased d-dimer (96.2%) (median of d-dimer: 1158 ng/ml FEU), increased fibrinogen (75.2%) (median: 5.23 g/l), increased factor VIII (86%) (median: 264.8 U/dl), decreased protein S (22.5% of women, 62.5% of men) (median: 62.8 and 68.5 U/dl, respectively), decreased protein C (7.6%) (median: 100 U/dl), decreased factor XII (25.3%) (median: 90.3 U/dl) and decreased antithrombin activity (21%) (median: 86 U/dl).

The method of decontamination applied to an artificially contaminated natural water sample was monitored using a biosensor based on laccase/magnetic nanoparticles. Given the amount of surfactin within the wash water the removal of p-cresol from artificially contaminated water was approximately 46.0 %. This result confirms the successful sustainable application of surfactin-rich wash waters to remove p-cresol from artificially contaminated natural water. The adsorption mechanism is potentially based on a multi-layer adsorption process, considering on Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms.","Gomes, Wyllerson Evaristo; Corrêa, Amanda Arthuzo; Beatto, Thainá Godoy; Etchegaray, Augusto; Nogueira, Alessandra Borin; Mendes, Renata Kelly",Environmental technology,465,1

Our prime aim was to evaluate the feasibility of CPAP for infants with bronchiolitis in a general paediatric ward, and secondary to assess capillary PCO2 (cPCO2) levels before and during treatment. METHODS From May 1(st) 2008 to April 30(th) 2012, infants with bronchiolitis at Stavanger University Hospital were treated with CPAP in a general paediatric ward, but could be referred to an intensive care unit (ICU) when needed, according to in-house guidelines. Levels of cPCO2 were prospectively registered before the start of CPAP and at approximately 4, 12, 24 and 48 hours of treatment as long as CPAP was given. We had a continuous updating program for the nurses and physicians caring for the infants with CPAP. The study was population based. RESULTS 672 infants (3.4%) were hospitalized with bronchiolitis. CPAP was initiated in 53 infants (0.3%; 7.9% of infants with bronchiolitis), and was well tolerated in all but three infants. 46 infants were included in the study, the majority of these (n = 33) were treated in the general ward only. These infants had lower cPCO2 before treatment (8.0; 7.7, 8.6)(median; quartiles) than those treated at the ICU (n = 13) (9.3;8.5, 9.9) (p < 0.001). The level of cPCO2 was significantly reduced after 4 h in both groups; 1.1 kPa (paediatric ward) (p < 0.001) and 1.3 kPa (ICU) (p = 0.002). Two infants on the ICU did not respond to CPAP (increasing cPCO2 and severe apnoe) and were given mechanical ventilation, otherwise no side effects were observed in either group treated with CPAP. CONCLUSION Treatment with CPAP for infants with bronchiolitis may be feasible in a general paediatric ward, providing sufficient staffing and training, and the possibility of referral to an ICU when needed.","Oymar, Knut; Bårdsen, Kjersti",BMC pediatrics,465,17

Results revealed that NBP attenuated thrombosis after MCAO and reduced brain infarct and atrophy volume. NBP administrated at 1 and 4 h after MCAO prevented the vasoconstriction of the artery and maintained its diameter at normal level. Administrated at one week after surgery, NBP functioned as a vasodilator in rats after MCAO while displayed no vasodilating effect in sham group.

It is involved in signaling the hedonic effects of rewards and also has essential roles in reinforcement and motivational processes. Here, we focused on opioid signaling through mu and delta receptors on dopaminoceptive neurons and evaluated the role these receptors play in reward-driven behaviors. We generated a genetically modified mouse with selective double knockdown of mu and delta opioid receptors in neurons expressing dopamine receptor D1. Selective expression of the transgene was confirmed using immunostaining. Knockdown was validated by measuring the effects of selective opioid receptor agonists on neuronal membrane currents using whole-cell patch clamp recordings. We found that in the nucleus accumbens of control mice, the majority of dopamine receptor D1-expressing neurons were sensitive to a mu or delta opioid agonist. In mutant mice, the response to the delta receptor agonist was blocked, while the effects of the mu agonist were strongly attenuated. Behaviorally, the mice had no obvious impairments. The mutation did not affect sensitivity to the rewarding effects of morphine injections or social contact and had no effect on preference for sweet taste. Knockdown had a moderate effect on motor activity in some of the tests performed, but this effect did not reach statistical significance. Thus, we found that knocking down mu and delta receptors on dopamine receptor D1-expressing cells does not appreciably affect reward-driven behaviors.

The e-learning framework, however, is the best solution to enable students to learn about the quality of education. The aim of this research was to examine variables reflecting the actual use of the e-learning system during the COVID-19 pandemic among university students. The perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are positively correlated with facilitating condition, perceived control, and self-efficacy, which in turn influences students’ attitude toward use, which in turn affects the actual use of the e-learning system during the COVID-19 pandemic. To exam the model on the basis of user data from the e-learning system used collected through an online survey, structural equation modeling (SEM) and path analysis were used. The findings showed that the mindset of students to use had positive effects on the learning of students during the COVID-19 pandemic through the actual use of the e-learning system. In the context of e-learning programs in developing countries, previous studies have seldom explored an integrated model. In addition, this article aims to include a literature review of recently published research on the actual use of the e-learning system during the pandemic of COVID-19. © Copyright © 2021 Alyoussef.","Alyoussef, I.",Frontiers in Education,465,1

Because all CoVs use −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF) to control expression of key viral proteins, the frameshift signal in viral mRNA that stimulates −1 PRF provides a promising potential target for such therapeutics. To test the viability of this strategy, we explored a group of 6 small-molecule ligands, evaluating their activity against the frameshift signals from a panel of representative bat CoVs—the most likely source of future zoonoses—as well as SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. We found that whereas some ligands had notable activity against only a few of the frameshift signals, the serine protease inhibitor nafamostat suppressed −1 PRF significantly in several of them, while having limited to no effect on −1 PRF caused by frameshift signals from other viruses used as negative controls. These results suggest it is possible to find small-molecule ligands that inhibit −1 PRF specifically in a broad spectrum of CoVs, establishing the frameshift signal as a viable target for developing pan-coronaviral therapeutics.","Munshi, Sneha; Neupane, Krishna; Ileperuma, Sandaru M.; Halma, Matthew T.J.; Kelly, Jamie A.; Halpern, Clarissa F.; Dinman, Jonathan D.; Loerch, Sarah; Woodside, Michael T.",bioRxiv,465,24

To control the epidemic, all the state governments in the United States took the mask mandates to ask people to wear masks in public. However, many people doubt if the mask can help them prevent the spread of the virus, and there are few researches about the effectiveness of the mask mandates in each state. To tackle this issue, this paper proposed an evaluating system for the effectiveness of mask mandate in each state in the U.S.A, which can be utilized to analyze whether mask mandates can slow down the spread of the virus. And if the effectiveness of mask mandates is different in different states, this paper will continue to find out which factor can most affect the effectiveness. The experimental results demonstrated that even though the new cases in some states still increased after the mask mandates, it can be seemed that the mask mandates do control the spread of the virus in general. According to the research, the paper can find that the most influential factor to the effectiveness is the infection rate. There are also some secondary factors to the effectiveness of mask mandates. Through these researches, they can analyze the result to develop more effective mandates to control the epidemic and help governments and companies develop new products to fit the needs during the epidemic.","Zhou, Chuang",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,465,13

Though initially described as simple single-gene non-segmented viruses encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a subset of narnaviruses referred to as “ambigrammatic” harbor a unique genomic configuration consisting of overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) encoded on opposite strands. Phylogenetic analysis supports selection to maintain this unusual genome organization, but functional investigations are lacking. Here, we establish the mosquito-infecting Culex narnavirus 1 (CxNV1) as a model to investigate the functional role of overlapping ORFs in narnavirus replication. In CxNV1, a reverse ORF without homology to known proteins covers nearly the entire 3.2 kb segment encoding the RdRp. Additionally, two opposing and nearly completely overlapping novel ORFs are found on the second putative CxNV1 segment, the 0.8 kb “Robin” RNA. We developed a system to launch CxNV1 in a naïve mosquito cell line, then showed that functional RdRp is required for persistence of both segments, and an intact reverse ORF is required on the RdRp segment for persistence. Mass spectrometry of persistently CxNV1-infected cells provided evidence for translation of this reverse ORF. Finally, ribosome profiling yielded a striking pattern of footprints for all four CxNV1 RNA strands that was distinct from actively-translating ribosomes on host mRNA or co-infecting RNA viruses. Taken together, these data raise the possibility that the process of translation itself is important for persistence of ambigrammatic narnaviruses, potentially by protecting viral RNA with ribosomes, thus suggesting a heretofore undescribed viral tactic for replication and transmission. IMPORTANCE Fundamental to our understanding of RNA viruses is a description of which strand(s) of RNA are transmitted as the viral genome, relative to which encode the viral proteins. Ambigrammatic narnaviruses break the mold. These viruses, found broadly in fungi, plants, and insects, have the unique feature of two overlapping genes encoded on opposite strands, comprising nearly the full length of the viral genome. Such extensive overlap is not seen in other RNA viruses, and comes at the cost of reduced evolutionary flexibility in the sequence. The present study is motivated by investigating the benefits which balance that cost. We show for the first time a functional requirement for the ambigrammatic genome configuration in Culex narnavirus 1, which suggests a model for how translation of both strands might benefit this virus. Our work highlights a new blueprint for viral persistence, distinct from strategies defined by canonical definitions of the coding strand.","Retallack, Hanna; Popova, Katerina D.; Laurie, Matthew T.; Sunshine, Sara; DeRisi, Joseph L.",bioRxiv,465,24

Here, the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) in modulating low density lipoprotein (LDL) content in confluent primary human aortic endothelial cells (pHAECs) was investigated. TNFα promoted up to 2 folds increase in cellular cholesterol, which was resistant to ACAT inhibition. The cholesterol increase was associated with increased 125I-LDL surface binding. Using the non-hydrolysable label, Dil, TNFα could induce a massive increase in Dil-LDL by over 200 folds. The elevated intracellular Dil-LDL was blocked with excess unlabeled LDL and PCSK9, but not oxidized LDL (oxLDL), receptor associated protein (RAP), or apolipoprotein (apoE) depletion. Moreover, TNFα-induced increase of LDL-derived lipids was elevated through lysosome inhibition. Using specific LDLR antibody, the Dil-LDL accumulation was reduced by over 99%. Effects of TNFα included LDLR cell surface increase by 138%, and very large increases in ICAM-1 total and surface proteins, respectively. In contrast, that of scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1) was reduced. Additionally, LDLR antibody bound rapidly in TNFα-treated cells by about 30 folds, inducing a migrating shift in the LDLR protein. The effect of TNFα on Dil-LDL accumulation was inhibited by the antioxidant tetramethythiourea (TMTU) dose-dependently, but not by inhibitors against NF-κB, stress kinases, ASK1, JNK, p38, or apoptosis caspases. Grown on transwell inserts, TNFα did not enhance apical to basolateral LDL cholesterol or Dil release. It is concluded that TNFα promotes LDLR functions through combined increase at the cell surface and SR-B1 downregulation.","Okoro, Emmanuel Ugochukwu",bioRxiv,465,20

FK506 – binding protein like (FKBPL) is a member of the immunophilin protein superfamily with potent anti-tumor activity through inhibition of angiogenesis and cancer stemness. An FKBPL-based 23mer peptide, ALM201, displayed a good safety and pharmacokinetic profile in a Phase 1a oncology clinical trial and was subsequently designated orphan drug status by the FDA in ovarian cancer. Here we describe a novel role for FKBPL and its peptides in regulating vascular integrity and cytokine production though modulating NF-κB signaling. FKBPL knockdown promoted endothelial cell barrier permeability, which was further exacerbated upon stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and accompanied by increased expression of TNF mRNA and phosphorylation of p65(RelA). Whilst treatment with the FKBPL based pre-clinical peptide, AD-01, increased VE-cadherin endothelial tight junctions following LPS stimulation. Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) from FKBPL haploinsufficient mice (Fkbpl+/−) also demonstrated increased phosphorylation of p65(RelA) in response to LPS stimulation compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, treatment with AD-01 inhibited p65(RelA) phosphorylation following LPS stimulation resulting in reduced NF-κB target gene expression and proinflammatory cytokine production. In an in vivo LPS survival model, Fkbpl+/− mice have reduced survival compared to wild-type mice. Moreover, treatment of wild-type mice with the clinical FKBPL-based peptide, ALM201, following LPS injection resulted in a 100% survival rate in mice at experimental endpoint, as well as an abrogation of production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF and IL-6, in peritoneal lavage washings. Analysis of human genetic biobanks found an association between common genetic variants associated with FKBPL and traits associated with inflammatory disorders such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and high lymphocyte count. In summary, for the first time, we describe a novel role for FKBPL as a regulator of inflammation and vascular integrity through modulating NF-κB signaling and FKBPL based therapies demonstrate potent anti-inflammatory activity.","Annett, Stephanie; Spence, Shaun; Garciarena, Carolina; Campbell, Ciaran; Dennehy, Margaret; Drakeford, Clive; Lai, Jacqueline; Dowling, Jennifer; Moore, Gillian; Yakkundi, Anita; Short, Amy; Sharpe, Danny; Furlong, Fiona; O’Donnell, James S.; Cavalleri, Gianpiero; Kerrigan, Steve; Tikhonova, Irina G.; Johnson, Pauline; Kissenpfennig, Adrien; Robson, Tracy",bioRxiv,465,16

It presents a case study of “covert transediting” in the Shanghai Observer, i.e., a journalistic opinion that interweaves Chinese renderings of selected excerpts from four British and American media texts. With an integrated approach to travelling memory (Erll, Astrid. 2011. Travelling memory. Parallax 17(4). 4–18) via transediting, our analysis shows that the transeditor does not only choose source texts in terms of media and content, but also selectively reframes the “Spanish flu” memory for lesson learning in conjunction with the mainstream Chinese discourse and practice of COVID-19 control. It unveils how the Great Influenza is thus transculturally remembered in more simplified and ideologically agreeable manners through omission, summary translation, and transformation, while faithful transference is not sheerly dispensed. We contend that transcultural remembrance via transediting is a purposive, socio-culturally shaped practice involving interrelations and interactions of manifold factors, and we need a more complex approach to the politics of memory in translation. Journalistic translation, which is mostly covert and transediting, is among different genres of translation that shape transcultural memory;more research in their interplay is called for.

This may be of particular importance for patients with MM, a condition characterized by considerable heterogeneity in PROs at different timepoints within a patient's disease journey (TA King et al, Semin Oncol Nurs. 2017;33(3):299-315;R Abonour et al, Ann Hematol. 2018;97(12):2425-36). There is also a growing body of evidence to support that digital platforms in healthcare can have an impact on patients' lives and improve the patient care experience across diverse medical settings. Web-based platforms that provide education and allow patients to track data have demonstrated improvement across a range of PROs measuring empowerment, self-efficacy, and mastery when compared against standard of care in a variety of disease states (MR Fu et al, Internet Interv. 2016;5:56-64;G Bouma et al, Support Care Cancer. 2017;25(7):2075-2083). This may be particularly relevant in light of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic. Patient-reported outcome data (e.g., symptoms) that can be readily shared with healthcare professionals (HCPs) can support clinical decision making and impact patient outcomes (E Basch et al, JAMA. 2017 Jul 11;318(2):197-8). Data collected through wearables (such as emoji scales and activity) have been shown to be correlated with traditional, validated PRO measures in patients with cancer (CA Thompson et al, Blood. 2017;130(Suppl 1):2179). Digital medication tracking has led to better medication adherence, increased prescription refills, and better clinical outcomes. Centralized disease management digital platforms have shown potential to reduce patients’ risk of complications (S Kumar et al, Abstract for the 77th American Diabetes Association. 2017). Despite this body of evidence supporting the potential impact of the use of digital platforms, there is little evidence specifically in MM. The MyHOPE™ for MM Solution is a validated investigational digital technology platform designed to provide patients with a comprehensive set of tools and resources to support the patient throughout their overall experience with MM and to collect biometrics and self-reported data such as symptom tracking, medication adherence, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with the ability to share this data with the patient's care team. MyHOPE™ for MM is the first prospective study evaluating the impact of a digital intervention for patients with hematological malignancies. Study Design and Methods: This is a multi-center, randomized, pilot trial of the MyHOPE™ for MM Solution. Approximately 126 adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) with a diagnosis of MM and who reside in the USA will be recruited from approximately 30 study sites within the USA, reflecting both community and academic centers. Patients will be stratified according to disease status (newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma transplant-eligible or ineligible, newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma in patients undergoing their first autologous stem cell transplant, or relapsed and/or refractory) and will be randomized in a 2:1 manner to either the Patient App + HCP Portal (Cohort 1) or Patient App Alone (Cohort 2). Primary objectives include feasibility of the platform and patient empowerment and self-efficacy. Other objectives include user satisfaction with the platform, health-related quality of life, and clinical outcomes. Enrolled patients will receive MM-treament regimen according to their physician's care plan. The study is in start-up and recruitment is expected through 2021.

Taxation, in particular Value Added Tax (VAT), is a key area for strengthening international cooperation because of its critical role in financing the Covid-19 crisis and supporting global recovery. This paper proposes the adoption of VAT treaties based on two considerations. First, there exist, in the interplay between states’ VAT laws, over-taxation and under-taxation that can be more effectively addressed by treaties than by unilateral state actions. Secondly, unlike income tax treaties, VAT treaties would distribute more benefits from cooperation to developing countries than to developed countries, leading to normatively attractive distributional consequences.

The public response to the group’s association with the virus was, in part, built on an existing foundation of distrust and suspicion. In this paper, I examine the details of Shincheonji’s association with the coronavirus and the public reaction to it.

Many nations are struggling to curb the epidemic in spite of expanding testing facilities. In this study, we consider the case of Bangladesh, and fit a simple compartmental model holding a feature to distinguish between identified infected and infectious with time series data using least square fitting as well as the likelihood approach;prior to which, dynamics of the model were analyzed mathematically and the identifiability of the parameters has also been confirmed. The performance of the likelihood approach was found to be more promising and was used for further analysis. We performed fitting for different lengths of time intervals starting from the beginning of the outbreak, and examined the evolution of the key parameters from Bangladesh’s perspective. In addition, we deduced profile likelihood and 95% confidence interval for each of the estimated parameters. Our study demonstrates that the parameters defining the infectious and quarantine rates change with time as a consequence of the change in lock-down strategies and expansion of testing facilities. As a result, the value of the basic reproduction number R0 was shown to be between 1.5 and 12. The analysis reveals that the projected time and amplitude of the peak vary following the change in infectious and quarantine rates obtained through different lock-down strategies and expansion of testing facilities. The identification rate determines whether the observed peak shows the true prevalence. We find that by restricting the spread through quick identification and quarantine, or by implementing lock-down to reduce overall contact rate, the peak could be delayed, and the amplitude of the peak could be reduced. Another novelty of this study is that the model presented here can infer the unidentified COVID cases besides estimating the officially confirmed COVID cases.","Masud, M.

In this paper, the standard susceptible-infectious-recovered/removed (SIR) epidemic model is extended to a fourth compartment, V, of vaccinated persons. This extension involves the time t-dependent effective vaccination rate, v(t), that regulates the relationship between susceptible and vaccinated persons. The rate v(t) competes with the usual infection, a(t), and recovery, mu(t), rates in determining the time evolution of epidemics. The occurrence of a pandemic outburst with rising rates of new infections requires k+b&lt;1-2 eta, where k=mu(0)/a(0) and b=v(0)/a(0) denote the initial values for the ratios of the three rates, respectively, and eta MUCH LESS-THAN1 is the initial fraction of infected persons. Exact analytical inverse solutions t(Q) for all relevant quantities Q=[S,I,R,V] of the resulting SIRV model in terms of Lambert functions are derived for the semi-time case with time-independent ratios k and b between the recovery and vaccination rates to the infection rate, respectively. These inverse solutions can be approximated with high accuracy, yielding the explicit time-dependences Q(t) by inverting the Lambert functions. The values of the three parameters k, b and eta completely determine the reduced time evolution of the SIRV-quantities Q(tau). The influence of vaccinations on the total cumulative number and the maximum rate of new infections in different countries is calculated by comparing with monitored real time Covid-19 data. The reduction in the final cumulative fraction of infected persons and in the maximum daily rate of new infections is quantitatively determined by using the actual pandemic parameters in different countries. Moreover, a new criterion is developed that decides on the occurrence of future Covid-19 waves in these countries. Apart from in Israel, this can happen in all countries considered.","Schlickeiser, R.; Kroger, M.",Physics,465,1

In this study, vaccine effectiveness at preventing infection is estimated by comparing infection risk as a function of time since vaccination. A statistically significant four-fold reduction in infection risk was observed 14 days after the first vaccine dose and an eleven-fold reduction in infection risk was observed in fully vaccinated cadets. Overall, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 91% (95% confidence interval = 55-99%) effective at preventing infection in healthy young adults (17-26 years of age) in a university setting and military training environment.","Wickert, D.

However, tensors extracted from real-world data often are more complex due to: (i) Partial observation: Only a small subset of tensor elements are available. (ii) Coarse observation: Some tensor modes only present coarse and aggregated patterns (e.g., monthly summary instead of daily reports). In this paper, we are given a subset of the tensor and some aggregated/coarse observations (along one or more modes) and seek to recover the original fine-granular tensor with low-rank factorization. We formulate a coupled tensor completion problem and propose an efficient Multi-resolution Tensor Completion model (MTC) to solve the problem. Our MTC model explores tensor mode properties and leverages the hierarchy of resolutions to recursively initialize an optimization setup, and optimizes on the coupled system using alternating least squares. MTC ensures low computational and space complexity. We evaluate our model on two COVID-19 related spatio-temporal tensors. The experiments show that MTC could provide 65.20% and 75.79% percentage of fitness (PoF) in tensor completion with only 5% fine granular observations, which is 27.96% relative improvement over the best baseline. To evaluate the learned low-rank factors, we also design a tensor prediction task for daily and cumulative disease case predictions, where MTC achieves 50% in PoF and 30% relative improvements over the best baseline. © 2021 ACM.","Yang, C.; Singh, N.; Xiao, C.; Qian, C.; Solomonik, E.; Sun, J.","27th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, KDD 2021",465,1

Massive testing is essential to breaking the chain of COVID-19 transmission. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of at-home self-collected samples - saliva and combined nasal-oropharyngeal swabs (NOP) - for SARS-CoV-2 detection in a telemedicine platform for COVID-19 surveillance. We analyzed 201 patients who met the criteria of suspected COVID-19. NOP sampling were combined (nostrils and oropharynx) and saliva collected using a cotton pad device. Detection of SARS-COV-2 was performed by using the Altona RealStar(R) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit 1.0. According to our data, there was an overall significant agreement ({kappa} coefficient value of 0.58) between the performances of saliva and NOP. Assuming that positive results in either sample represent true infections, 70 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 were identified, with 52/70 being positive in NOP and 55/70 in saliva. This corresponds to sensitivities of 74.2% (95% CI; 63.7% to 83.1%) for NOP and 78.6% (95% CI; 67.6% to 86.6%) for saliva. We also found a strong correlation ({beta}-coefficients < 1) between the cycle threshold values in saliva and NOP. Ageusia was the only symptom associated with patients SARS-CoV-2 positive only in NOP (p=0.028). In conclusion, our data show the feasibility of using at-home self-collected samples (especially saliva), as an adequate alternative for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

Experimentally infected camelids clear infectious virus within one week and mount an effective adaptive immune response. Here, transcription of immune response genes was monitored in the respiratory tract of MERS-CoV infected alpacas. Concomitant to the peak of infection, occurring at 2 days post inoculation (dpi), type I and III interferons (IFNs) were maximally transcribed only in the nasal mucosa of alpacas, provoking the induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) along the whole respiratory tract. Simultaneous to mild focal infiltration of leukocytes in nasal mucosa and submucosa, upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 and dampened transcription of pro-inflammatory genes under NF-κB control were observed. In the lung, early (1 dpi) transcription of chemokines (CCL2 and CCL3) correlated with a transient accumulation of mainly mononuclear leukocytes. A tight regulation of IFNs in lungs with expression of ISGs and controlled inflammatory responses, might contribute to virus clearance without causing tissue damage. Thus, the nasal mucosa, the main target of MERS-CoV in camelids, is central in driving an efficient innate immune response based on triggering ISGs as well as the dual anti-inflammatory effects of type III IFNs and IL10. IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is the etiological agent of a respiratory disease causing high mortality in humans. In camelids, the main MERS-CoV reservoir host, viral infection leads to subclinical disease. Our study describes transcriptional regulations of innate immunological pathways underlying asymptomatic clinical manifestations of alpacas in response to MERS-CoV. Concomitant to the peak of infection, these animals elicited a strong transient interferon response and induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 in the nasal mucosa. This was associated to a dimmed regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induction of interferon stimulated genes along the whole respiratory mucosa, leading to the rapid clearance of the virus. Thus, innate immune responses occurring in the nasal mucosa appear to be the key in controlling MERS-CoV disease by avoiding a cytokine storm. Understanding on how asymptomatic host reservoirs counteract MERS-CoV infection will aid in the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines.","Te, Nigeer; Rodon, Jordi; Ballester, Maria; Pérez, Mónica; Pailler-García, Lola; Segalés, Joaquim; Vergara-Alert, Júlia; Bensaid, Albert",bioRxiv,465,16

METHODS The IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV were tested by indirect ELISA in serum samples from 301 clinically diagnosed SARS cases. RESULTS Totally 158 SARS cases were involved in 15 chains of transmission. The positive rates of SARS-CoV IgG in those chains were 85.70%-100.00% and the overall rate was 94.30% (149/158). The chain of transmission could spread to four generations, but the SARS cases were reduced with increase of generations. There was no significant difference among positive rates of SARS-CoV IgG for generations, Chi square=5.11, P greater than 0.05. The positive rate of SARS-CoV IgG in cases who were not in chain of transmission was 12.59%(18/143) which was statistically significantly different from that of cases in chain of transmission, Chi square=199.64, P less than 0.001. During days 0-7,8-14,15-21,22-30 after onset, the cumulated positive rate of SARS-CoV IgG was 16.67%, 40.00%, 70.00% and 93.10%, respectively, then was kept at the level above 90% and lasted for 217 days. The cumulated positive rate of SARS-CoV IgM during days 0-7 after onset was the same to that of IgG. During days 8-14, 55.17% of cases had seroconversion for IgM which reached a peak (86.96%) during days 21-30. Then the rate rapidly declined. CONCLUSION More than 94% of cases with SARS could produce IgG antibody when they were infected by SARS-CoV. Detecting SARS-CoV IgG could provide a diagnostic evidence for case confirmation. SARS-CoV IgG appeared as early as 7 days after onset and reached the peak at about weeks 4. Then the high rate of antibody was maintained for more than 6 months.","Wu, Li-ping; Mei, Zhi-qiang; Wang, Nai-chang; Zhao, Xi-fang; Na, Dan-yu; Zheng, Lei; Zhang, Li-yuan; Ren, Ze-ping; Fu, Shi-hong; Liang, Guo-dong",Zhonghua shi yan he lin chuang bing du xue za zhi = Zhonghua shiyan he linchuang bingduxue zazhi = Chinese journal of experimental and clinical virology,465,20

Though historically the developed world was a large supplier of meat and livestock for the developing world, the developing world has rapidly increased production and is meeting more of its growing domestic demand. Many regions of the developing world, however, do not produce enough currently to meet their domestic demand and continue to import more than they produce. There are exceptions, such as Brazil, Thailand, the People's Republic of China and India, where growth in livestock production has been rapid. It is anticipated that in the future many of the developing countries will increase domestic production to meet growing domestic demand. By 2030, beef will probably still be the most significant meat import of developing countries and milk will have more than doubled as a net export of the developed world.","Narrod, C; Tiongco, M; Scott, R",Revue scientifique et technique,465,7

Fecal samples from 121 cows in a single herd were tested for the presence of rotavirus and coronavirus, either free or complexed with immunoglobulin. Free rotavirus was not detected in any samples while rotavirus-immunoglobulin complexes were detected in 53 of 121 (44%) samples tested. In contrast, free coronavirus was detected in six (5%) samples and coronavirus-immunoglobulin complexes were detected in 85 (70%) of the samples tested. Thus it appears that subclinical infection of cows by either of these viruses is common, possibly providing a source for infection of the neonate. These assays may therefore provide important information regarding the epidemiology of enteric virus infections and suggest means of improving management to prevent epidemics of neonatal diarrhea.","Crouch, C F; Acres, S D",Canadian journal of comparative medicine : Revue canadienne de medecine comparee,465,23

A coordination program between Primary Care and Geriatrics and Public Health services was activated. METHODS 2,668 seniors were followed at 39 nursing homes. Data from new cases, active cases, mortality and place of treatment of COVID-19 were collected. A descriptive analysis was performed with the measurement of the absolute number of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases and the frequency distribution. RESULTS Between August 7th 2020 and February 26th 2021, 30 outbreaks occurred at 21 nursing homes. 300 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (11% of total residents). The daily average of active cases was 27,166 were hospitalized (55%). 66 patients died (22% of those infected), 54 of them (78%) at the hospital. 1,984 PCR tests were performed. The temporary profile of new cases did not follow a distribution ""in waves"" as in the community. Thirty-seven days after the start of the second dose of vaccination, there were no active cases until March 1st, when new cases were under study for possible vaccine leakage. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of COVID-19 at nursing homes after the first wave of the pandemic has apparently been lower. The transmission in these centers has followed a different distribution than at community. Mass vaccination has achieved the practical disappearance of the disease.","Menéndez Colino, Rocío; Merello de Miguel, Ana; Argentina, Francesca; Barcons Marqués, Montserrat; Chaparro Jiménez, Blanca; López Hernández, Paloma; Jiménez Bueno, Susana; Montero Vega, María Dolores; García Rodríguez, Julio; Ferrer Simo, Bernardo; Navarro Fernández, María Ángeles; Rincón Del Toro, Teresa; Alarcón Alarcón, Teresa; Martínez Peromingo, Francisco Javier; González-Montalvo, Juan Ignacio",Revista espanola de salud publica,465,23

Deleting the internal loop that contains the putative polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of BaMV genomic RNA appeared to diminish coat protein accumulation to 2% (C. P. Cheng and C. H. Tsai, J. Mol. Biol. 288:555-565, 1999). To investigate the function of the AAUAAA motif, mutations were introduced into an infectious BaMV cDNA at each residue except the first nucleotide. After transfection of Nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts with RNA transcript, the accumulations of viral coat protein and RNAs were determined. Based on the results, three different categories could be deduced for the mutants. Category 1 includes two mutants expressing levels of the viral products similar to those of the wild-type virus. Six mutations in category 2 led to decreased to similar levels of both minus-strand and genomic RNAs. Category 3 includes the remaining seven mutations that also bring about decreases in both minus- and plus-strand RNA levels, with more significant effects on genomic RNA accumulation. Mutant transcripts from each category were used to infect N. benthamiana plants, from which viral particles were isolated. The genomic RNAs of mutants in category 3 were found to have shorter poly(A) tails. Taken together, the results suggest that the AAUAAA motif in the 3' UTR of BaMV genomic RNA is involved not only in the formation of the poly(A) tail of the plus-strand RNA, but also in minus-strand RNA synthesis.","Chen, I-Hsuan; Chou, Wen-Jen; Lee, Pei-Yu; Hsu, Yau-Heiu; Tsai, Ching-Hsiu",Journal of virology,465,1

Cell-associated virus and SA titers were higher than those in the culture fluid, which had to be concentrated 20X before use as antigen in agar immunodiffusion tests (ID). By sucrose density-gradient centrifugation, the SA had a buoyant density of 1.10 g/ml and could be separated from the virus that banded in the 1.19-g/ml region. Virus and SA from three different isolates of TGE had the same buoyant densities. Heating and proteolytic enzyme digestion established the protein nature of the SA. As assayed by CF and ID, there were stability differences between crude and purified preparations of SA.

Globally millions of people have been diagnosed with the virus whilst thousands have died. As the virus kept spreading health and social care frontline workers (HSCFW) were faced with difficulties when discharging their duties. This paper was set out to explore the challenges faced by different frontline workers in health and social care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research utilized an explorative qualitative approach. A total of forty (N = 40) in-depth one-to-one semi-structured interviews were undertaken with HSCFW who included support workers (n = 15), nurses (n = 15), and managers (N = 10). Health and social care workers were drawn from domiciliary care and care homes (with and without nursing services). All the interviews were done online. The data were thematically analyzed, and the emergent themes were supported by quotes from the interviews held with participants. Following data analysis the research study found that lack of pandemic preparedness, shortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), anxiety and fear amongst professionals, challenges in enforcing social distancing, challenges in fulfilling social shielding responsibility, anxiety and fear amongst residents and service users, delay in testing, evolving PPE guidance and shortage of staff were challenges faced by frontline health and social care workers during COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the current study point to a need for adequate pandemic preparedness within the health and social care sector to protect both frontline workers and the individuals they look after.","Nyashanu, Mathew; Pfende, Farai; Ekpenyong, Mandu",J Interprof Care,465,21

The disruptions also included intentional and unintentional reductions in health services, including immunization campaigns against the transmission of wild poliovirus (WPV) and persistent serotype 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2). Building on a recently updated global poliovirus transmission and Sabin-strain oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) evolution model, we explored the implications of immunization disruption and restrictions of human interactions (i.e., population mixing) on the expected incidence of polio and on the resulting challenges faced by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI). We demonstrate that with some resumption of activities in the fall of 2020 to respond to cVDPV2 outbreaks and full resumption on January 1, 2021 of all polio immunization activities to pre-COVID-19 levels, the GPEI could largely mitigate the impact of COVID-19 to the delays incurred. The relative importance of reduced mixing (leading to potentially decreased incidence) and reduced immunization (leading to potentially increased expected incidence) depends on the timing of the effects. Following resumption of immunization activities, the GPEI will likely face similar barriers to eradication of WPV and elimination of cVDPV2 as before COVID-19. The disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic may further delay polio eradication due to indirect effects on vaccine and financial resources.","Kalkowska, Dominika A; Voorman, Arend; Pallansch, Mark A; Wassilak, Steven G F; Cochi, Stephen L; Badizadegan, Kamran; Thompson, Kimberly M",Vaccine,465,24

RESULTS: Pre-pandemic ageism toward older adults predicted less intentions to help older adults generally and specific to COVID-19. Whereas viewing older adults as incompetent predicted greater intentions to help specific to COVID-19. DISCUSSION: These results reflect the complexity of predicting helping behaviors and suggest that even supportive behaviors toward older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic may be rooted in negative ageist stereotypes.

Yet demographic factors are relatively poor predictors compared to individual attitudes and media diets. We argue that public officials should make efforts to inform and persuade the public of the importance of social distancing, targeting mediums like TV and radio where audiences are less likely to currently engage in social distancing or are less likely to envision themselves sustaining strict social distancing for several weeks or months.

Method: We developed a novel information-dependent pooling protocol (indept), based on transmission of less informative sequential pools on to the next pooling cycle to maximize savings. We then compared it to the halving, generalized halving, splitting and hypercube protocols in a simulation study, across variety of scenarios. Results: All five methods yielded various amount of test savings, which mostly depended on the virus prevalence in the population. In situations of low prevalence (up to 5%), indept had the best performance, requiring on average 20% of tests needed for singular testing across scenarios that were analyzed. Nevertheless, this comes at the expense of speed, with the worst-case scenario of indept protocol requiring up to twice the time needed to test the same number of samples in comparison to the hypercube protocol. In order to offset this, we developed a faster version of the protocol (indeptSp), which minimizes the number of terminal pools and manages to retain savings compared to other protocols, despite marginally longer processing times. Conclusion: The increasing demand for more testing globally can benefit from application of pooling, especially in resource-restrained situations of the low- and middle-income countries or situations of high testing demand. Singular testing in situations of low prevalence should be systematically discouraged.","Vukicevic, Damir; Polasek, Ozren",J Glob Health,465,24

Aim of our study is to identify the best predictors of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission in patients with Covid-19. We examined 28 patients admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) and subsequently confirmed as cases of Covid-19. Patients received, at the admission to the ED, a diagnostic work-up including: patient history, clinical examination, an arterial blood gas analysis (whenever possible performed on room air), laboratory blood tests, including serum concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), lung ultrasound examination and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax. For each patient, as gas exchange index through the alveolocapillary membrane, we determined the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (AaDOâ 2) and the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient augmentation (AaDOâ 2 augmentation). For each patient, as measurement of hypoxemia, we determined oxygen saturation (SpO2), partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaOâ 2), PaOâ 2 deficit and the ratio between arterial partial pressure of oxygen by blood gas analysis and fraction of inspired oxygen (P/F). Patients were assigned to ICU Group or to Non-ICU Group basing on the decision to intubate. Areas under the curve (AUC) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to compare the performance of each test in relation to prediction of ICU admission. Comparing patients of ICU Group (10 patients) with patients of Non-ICU Group (18 patients), we found that the first were older, they had more frequently a medical history of malignancy and they were more frequently admitted to ED for dyspnea. Patients of ICU Group had lower oxygen saturation, PaOâ 2, P/F and higher heart rate, respiratory rate, AaDOâ 2, AaDOâ 2 augmentation and lactate than patients of Non-ICU Group. ROC curves demonstrate that age, heart rate, respiratory rate, dyspnea, lactate, AaDO2, AaDO2 augmentation, white blood cell count, neutrophil count and percentage, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose level, international normalized ratio (INR), blood urea and IL-6 are useful predictors of ICU admission. We identified several predictors of ICU admission in patients with Covid-19. They can act as fast tools for the early identification and timely treatment of critical cases since their arrival in the ED.","Carlino, Maria Viviana; Valenti, Natja; Cesaro, Flavio; Costanzo, Anita; Cristiano, Giovanna; Guarino, Mario; Sforza, Alfonso",Monaldi arch. chest dis,465,1

As a widely used drug for tumor therapy or bone marrow transplantation, busulfan has a severe side effect on SPCs population and causes a consequent infertility. Recently, accumulating evidence revealed the protective role of autophagy in stem cell maintenance under exogenous stress. To better understand the role of autophagy in SPCs fates, we investigated the potential function of autophagy in SPCs under busulfan stress, and found that treatment of busulfan induced the formation of autophagic vesicles and autophagosomes in mouse SPCs. Subsequently, a connection of autophagy and SPCs maintenance and survival was demonstrated in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, mTOR was identified as an essential factor for autophagy in SPCs with a complicated mechanism: (1) mTOR is phosphorylated by AKT to activate its target genes, p70s6 kinase, resulting in the inhibition of autophagy during short-term busulfan treatment. (2) mTOR mediates autophagy with p53 together, to regulate the fate of SPCs. Collectively, observations from this study indicate that moderate autophagy effectively protects SPCs from the stress of chemotherapy, which may provide an important hint for fertility protection in clinic.","Wei, Rui; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Cai, Yihui; Liu, Hongyang; Wang, Bingyuan; Zhao, Xiaodong; Zou, Kang",,465,29

INSUFFICIENT GUIDANCE ON THE USE OF DONOR HUMAN MILK AND THE ROLE OF HUMAN MILK BANKS IN THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE: COVID-19 clinical management guidelines in seven countries in Southeast Asia are not aligned with WHO recommendations despite the lack of evidence of transmission through either breastmilk or breastfeeding. The use of safe donor human milk accessed through human milk banks is also insufficiently recommended, even in countries with an existing human milk bank, leading to a gap in evidence-based management of COVID-19. This highlights long-standing challenges as well as opportunities in the safe, equitable, and resilient implementation of human milk banks in the region. CONCLUSIONS: This statement reflects the expert opinion of the Regional Human Milk Bank Network for Southeast Asia and Beyond on the need to revisit national guidelines based on the best evidence for breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic, to incorporate human milk bank services in national obstetric and newborn care guidelines for COVID-19 where possible, and to ensure that operations of human milk banks are adapted to meet the needs of the current pandemic and to sustain donor human milk supply in the long-term.

Resumo- Este estudo teve por objetivo avaliar o desenvolvimento ponderal e a dinâmica dos parâmetros hematológicos e bioquímicos de cordeiros Pantaneiros submetidos a diferentes manejos de amamentação dos 15 aos 43 dias. Para isso, 30 cordeiros foram separados em três diferentes grupos (n=10). Os grupos foram caracterizados conforme o tempo de permanência das ovelhas com suas crias em diferentes sistemas de amamentação: MAM24 - ovelhas e cordeiros 24 horas em conjunto. MAM12- ovelhas e cordeiros 12 horas em conjunto durante a noite. MAM2x30 - ovelhas e cordeiros 30 minutos pela manhã e 30 minutos pela tarde em conjunto. As coletas de amostras sanguíneas e as pesagens ocorriam a cada sete dias. Observou-se aumento significativo no peso com o avanço da idade dos cordeiros nos três manejos, mas os tratamentos não diferiram entre si para o ganho de peso. Foram identificadas diferenças entre os três tratamentos para a variável hematológica CHGM e para as variáveis bioquímicas AST, glicose, ureia e proteína total. Correlacionando a idade dos cordeiros com as variáveis bioquímicas notou-se variação influenciada pela faixa etária dos animais. Os diferentes manejos de amamentação não influenciaram o desenvolvimento ponderal dos cordeiros.

The most definitive approach to identify the intermediate host would be the detection of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses in wild animals. However, due to the high number of animal species, it is not feasible to screen all the species in the laboratory. Given that binding to ACE2 proteins is the first step for the coronaviruses to invade host cells, we propose a computational pipeline to identify potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and host ACE2. Using this pipeline, we systematically examined 285 ACE2 variants from mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and found that the binding energies calculated for the modeled Spike-RBD/ACE2 complex structures correlated closely with the effectiveness of animal infection as determined by multiple experimental data sets. Built on the optimized binding affinity cutoff, we suggest a set of 96 mammals, including 48 experimentally investigated ones, which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, with candidates from primates, rodents, and carnivores at the highest risk of infection. Overall, this work not only suggests a limited range of potential intermediate SARS-CoV-2 hosts for further experimental investigation, but also, more importantly, it proposes a new structure-based approach to general zoonotic origin and susceptibility analyses that are critical for human infectious disease control and wildlife protection.","Huang, Xiaoqiang; Zhang, Chengxin; Pearce, Robin; Omenn, Gilbert S; Zhang, Yang",J Proteome Res,465,16

Such information is unreliable and has very little value in assessing programmatic quality and impact. Regular monitoring of key process and outcome indicators based on data collected through a robust information system is essential to ensure quality of a screening programme. Fragmented health systems, limited resources and absence of a culture of systematic evaluation are the major hindrances for most of the LMICs to build electronic information systems to manage screening. The COVID-19 pandemic has created an impetus for the countries to customize the freely available District Health Information Software (DHIS2) to collect electronic data to track the outbreaks and manage containment measures. In the present article we present Bangladesh as an exemplar LMIC that has a (DHIS2) based integrated health information system gradually upgraded to collect individual data of the participants to the national cervical cancer screening program. Such efforts paid rich dividends as the screening program was switched from opportunistic to a population-based one. Moreover, the electronic system could report impact of the pandemic on cancer screening on a monthly basis. The aggregate number of women screened in the year 2020 was 14.1% less compared to 2019. The monthly rate of screening during peak of the outbreak was only 5.1% of the previous year. The rate rapidly recovered as the program intensified screening in the hard-to-reach regions less affected by the pandemic and expanded the outreach services. Other LMICs may emulate Bangladesh example. Customizing the information system developed for pandemic surveillance to collect cancer screening data will help them build back the screening programs better.","Basu, Partha; Lucas, Eric; Zhang, Li; Muwonge, Richard; Murillo, Raul; Nessa, Ashrafun",Prev Med,465,24

The estimation of the unemployment rate has drawn researchers' attention in recent years. This investigation's key objective is to inquire about the impact of COVID-19 on the unemployment rate in selected, developed and developing countries of Asia. For experts and policymakers, effective prediction of the unemployment rate is an influential test that assumes an important role in planning the monetary and financial development of a country. Numerous researchers have recently utilized conventional analysis tools for unemployment rate prediction. Notably, unemployment data sets are nonstationary. Therefore, modeling these time series by conventional methods can produce an arbitrary mistake. To overcome the accuracy problem associated with conventional approaches, this investigation assumes intelligent-based prediction approaches to deal with the unemployment data and to predict the unemployment rate for the upcoming years more precisely. These intelligent-based unemployment rate strategies will force their implications by repeating diversity in the unemployment rate. For illustration purposes, unemployment data sets of five advanced and five developing countries of Asia, essentially Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, and five agricultural countries (i.e., Pakistan, China, India, Bangladesh and Indonesia) are selected. The hybrid ARIMA-ARNN model performed well among all hybrid models for advanced countries of Asia, while the hybrid ARIMA-ANN outperformed for developing countries aside from China, and hybrid ARIMA-SVM performed well for China. Furthermore, for future unemployment rate prediction, these selected models are utilized. The result displays that in developing countries of Asia, the unemployment rate will be three times higher as compared to advanced countries in the coming years, and it will take double the time to address the impacts of Coronavirus in developing countries than in developed countries of Asia.","Lai, Han; Khan, Yousaf Ali; Thaljaoui, Adel; Chammam, Wathek; Abbas, Syed Zaheer",Soft comput,465,33

Efficient PUI evaluation is needed to preserve scarce healthcare resources. We describe the development, implementation, and outcomes of an inpatient diagnostic algorithm and clinical decision support system (CDSS) to evaluate PUIs. METHODS: We conducted a pre-post study of CORAL (COvid Risk cALculator), a CDSS that guides frontline clinicians through a risk-stratified COVID-19 diagnostic workup, removes transmission-based precautions when workup is complete and negative, and triages complex cases to Infectious Diseases (ID) physician review. Pre-CORAL, ID physicians reviewed all PUI records to guide workup and precautions. Post-CORAL, frontline clinicians evaluated PUIs directly using CORAL. We compared pre- and post-CORAL frequency of repeat SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), time from NAAT result to PUI status discontinuation, total duration of PUI status, and ID physician work-hours, using linear and logistic regression, adjusted for COVID-19 incidence. RESULTS: Fewer PUIs underwent repeat testing after an initial negative NAAT post-CORAL than pre-CORAL (54% vs. 67%; aOR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.44-0.63, p<0.01). CORAL significantly reduced average time to PUI status discontinuation (adjusted difference: -7.4 [SE 0.8] hours/patient; p<0.01), total duration of PUI status (adjusted difference: -19.5 [SE 1.9] hours/patient; p<0.01), and average ID physician work-hours (adjusted difference: -57.4 [SE 2.0] hours/day; p<0.01). No patients had a positive NAAT within 7 days after discontinuation of precautions via CORAL. CONCLUSIONS: CORAL is an efficient and effective CDSS to guide frontline clinicians through the diagnostic evaluation of PUIs and safe discontinuation of precautions.","Dugdale, Caitlin M; Rubins, David M; Lee, Hang; McCluskey, Suzanne M; Ryan, Edward T; Kotton, Camille N; Hurtado, Rocio M; Ciaranello, Andrea L; Barshak, Miriam B; McEvoy, Dustin S; Nelson, Sandra B; Basgoz, Nesli; Lazarus, Jacob E; Ivers, Louise C; Reedy, Jennifer L; Hysell, Kristen M; Lemieux, Jacob E; Heller, Howard M; Dutta, Sayon; Albin, John S; Brown, Tyler S; Miller, Amy L; Calderwood, Stephen B; Walensky, Rochelle P; Zachary, Kimon C; Hooper, David C; Hyle, Emily P; Shenoy, Erica S",Clin. infect. dis,465,29

The main purpose of the modeling is to show the effects arising when the line of action of friction forces is shifted to the belt's middle axis. The prestressed shearable model of the belt is used in this study. The differential equations of the steady state motion are integrated and combined together with the boundary conditions into two nonlinear systems of algebraic equations corresponding to the different cases of the belt behavior: presence and absence of a sliding segment. The nonlinearity results from the fact that the boundaries of the contact segments are a priori unknown. The case without sliding requires introduction of a concentrated force at the point where the belt leaves the pulley.

Nucleoside analogues, such as Remdesivir and Favipiravir, can serve as the first-line broad-spectrum antiviral drugs by targeting the viral polymerases. However, the underlying mechanisms for the antiviral efficacies of these drugs are far from well understood. Here we reveal that Favipiravir, as a pyrazine derivative, could be incorporated into the viral RNA products by mimicking both adenine and guanine nucleotides. This drug thus inhibits viral replication mainly by inducing mutations in progeny RNAs, different from Remdesivir or other RNA-terminating nucleoside analogues that impair the elongation of RNA products. We further determined the cryo-EM structure of Favipiravir bound to the replicating polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 in the pre-catalytic state. This structure provides a missing snapshot for visualizing the catalysis dynamics of coronavirus polymerase, and reveals an unexpected base-pairing pattern between Favipiravir and pyrimidine residues which may explain its capacity for mimicking both adenine and guanine nucleotides. These findings shed lights on the mechanism of coronavirus polymerase catalysis and provide a rational basis for developing antiviral drugs to combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Peng, Qi; Peng, Ruchao; Yuan, Bin; Wang, Min; Zhao, Jingru; Fu, Lifeng; Qi, Jianxun; Shi, Yi",Innovation (N Y),465,16

Accordingly, an organization should be well prepared to meet its long term and short term expenses and goals, thereby enabling the managers to monitor organizational functions. During the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, many organizations adopted the GIG economy and digital transformation. People work remotely in part-time or temporary positions as a staff in an organization, making work cheaper and more efficient services being provided. Justly, a proper coordination of the GIG workers and digital transformation amidst the changing economic situation is necessary for making financial budgets and budgetary control a success. The study investigates the implication of GIG workers and digital transformation on financial budgets and budgetary control. The study collected primary data through a survey research design from institutions in Ogun State, Nigeria. The paper explored finding from accounting officers in the institutions. Purposive sampling technique was used to select 40 well completed questionnaires from the participants in selected institution. The study adopted both descriptive and inferential statistics in analyzing results. The result indicates that a positive significant relationship exists between GIG workers and Covid-19 improves digital transformation in HEI. It is therefore recommended that a GIG worker should be a strategy to budgetary control of financial budget in the case of pandemic or any emergency within the HEI.

METHODS: Mothers of 572 infants (46% girls) aged 1-12 months (M = 5.9, standard deviation = 2.9) participated. Assessments were conducted on 4 occasions from late March to May 2020. Infant sleep was measured objectively using auto-videosomnography. Mothers reported their sheltering status, demographic characteristics, and infant sleep. RESULTS: Infants of mothers in home confinement had later sleep offset times and longer nighttime sleep durations, compared to infants of mothers who were working as usual. At the end of March, these infants also had earlier bedtimes, more nighttime awakenings, and more parental nighttime visits, but differences were not apparent during April and May. CONCLUSIONS: Living restrictions issued in the United States may have led to longer sleep durations and temporary delays in sleep consolidation for infants of mothers in home confinement.","Kahn, Michal; Barnett, Natalie; Glazer, Assaf; Gradisar, Michael",Sleep Health,465,12

A multicenter phase 2 clinical trial of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis in children hospitalized with COVID-19-related illness has recently been initiated in the United States. To date, there remains a paucity of high-quality evidence to inform clinical practice world-wide. Therefore, the objective of this scientific statement is to provide consensus-based recommendations on the use of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis in children hospitalized for COVID-19-related illnesses, and to identify priorities for future research. METHODS: We surveyed 20 pediatric hematologists and pediatric critical care physicians from several continents who were identified by Pediatric/Neonatal Hemostasis and Thrombosis Subcommittee leadership as having experience and expertise in the use of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis and/or the management of COVID-19-related illness in children. A comprehensive review of the literature on COVID-19 in children was also performed. RESULTS: Response rate was 90%. Based on consensus of expert opinions, we suggest the administration of low-dose low molecular weight heparin subcutaneously twice-daily as anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis (in the absence of contraindications, and in combination with mechanical thromboprophylaxis with sequential compression devices, where feasible) in children hospitalized for COVID-19-related illness (including the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children [MIS-C]) who have markedly elevated D-dimer levels or superimposed clinical risk factors for hospitalassociated VTE. For children who are clinically unstable or have severe renal impairment, we suggest the use of unfractionated heparin by continuous intravenous infusion as anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. In addition, continued efforts to characterize VTE risk and risk factors in children with COVID-19, as well as to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis strategies in children hospitalized with COVID-19-related illness (including MIS-C) via cooperative multicenter trials, were identified among several key priorities for future research. CONCLUSION: These consensus-based recommendations on the use of anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis in children hospitalized for COVID-19-related illnesses and priorities for future research will be updated as high-quality evidence emerges.","Goldenberg, Neil A; Sochet, Anthony; Albisetti, Manuela; Biss, Tina; Bonduel, Mariana; Jaffray, Julie; MacLaren, Graeme; Monagle, Paul; O039,; Brien, Sarah; Raffini, Leslie; Revel-Vilk, Shoshana; Sirachainan, Nongnuch; Williams, Suzan; Zia, Ayesha; Male, Christoph",J Thromb Haemost,465,20

This rapid systematic review synthesised published reports of medical educational developments in response to the pandemic, considering descriptions of interventions, evaluation data and lessons learned. METHODS: The authors systematically searched four online databases and hand searched MedEdPublish up to 24 May 2020. Two authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts, performed data extraction and assessed risk of bias for included articles. Discrepancies were resolved by a third author. A descriptive synthesis and outcomes were reported. RESULTS: Forty-nine articles were included. The majority were from North America, Asia and Europe. Sixteen studies described Kirkpatrick's outcomes, with one study describing levels 1-3. A few papers were of exceptional quality, though the risk of bias framework generally revealed capricious reporting of underpinning theory, resources, setting, educational methods, and content. Key developments were pivoting educational delivery from classroom-based learning to virtual spaces, replacing clinical placement based learning with alternate approaches, and supporting direct patient contact with mitigated risk. Training for treating patients with COVID-19, service reconfiguration, assessment, well-being, faculty development, and admissions were all addressed, with the latter categories receiving the least attention. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights several areas of educational response in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and identifies a few articles of exceptional quality that can serve as models for future developments and educational reporting. There was often a lack of practical detail to support the educational community in enactment of novel interventions, as well as limited evaluation data. However, the range of options deployed offers much guidance for the medical education community moving forward and there was an indication that outcome data and greater detail will be reported in the future.","Gordon, Morris; Patricio, Madalena; Horne, Laura; Muston, Alexandra; Alston, Sebastian R; Pammi, Mohan; Thammasitboon, Satid; Park, Sophie; Pawlikowska, Teresa; Rees, Eliot L; Doyle, Andrea Jane; Daniel, Michelle",Med Teach,465,33

We conducted a case-control study within the UK Biobank cohort linked to the COVID-19 tests results available from 16 March 2020 until 23 August 2020. The main exposure variable was socioeconomic status, assessed using the Townsend Deprivation Index. Among 18,917 participants with an incident malignancy in the UK Biobank cohort, 89 tested positive for COVID-19. The overall COVID-19 incidence was 4.7 cases per 1000 incident cancer patients (95%CI 3.8-5.8). Compared with the least deprived cancer patients, those living in the most deprived areas had an almost three times higher risk of testing positive (RR 2.6, 95%CI 1.1-5.8). Other independent risk factors were ethnic minority background, obesity, unemployment, smoking, and being diagnosed with a haematological cancer for less than five years. A consistent pattern of socioeconomic inequalities in COVID-19 among incident cancer patients in the UK highlights the need to prioritise the cancer patients living in the most deprived areas in vaccination planning. This socio-demographic profiling of vulnerable cancer patients at increased risk of infection can inform prevention strategies and policy improvements for the coming pandemic waves.","Lee, Shing Fung; Niksic, Maja; Rachet, Bernard; Sanchez, Maria-Jose; Luque-Fernandez, Miguel Angel",,465,20

APPROACH & RESULTS: Patients who were listed with MELD>25 from 2008-2017 were analyzed with intention-to-treat(ITT) basis retrospectively. Patients who had a potential live donor were analyzed as ITT-LDLT whereas those who had none belonged to ITT-deceased donor liver transplantation(ITT-DDLT)group. ITT-overall survival(ITT-OS) was analyzed from the time of listing. 325 patients were listed(ITT-LDLT n=212, ITT-DDLT n=113). The risk of delist/death was lower in the ITT-LDLT group(43.4% vs. 19.8%,P<0.001)while transplant rate was higher in the ITT-LDLT group(78.3% vs. 52.2%,P<0.001). The 5-year ITT-OS were superior in the ITT-LDLT group(72.6% vs. 49.5%,P<0.001) for MELD>25, and for MELD>25 and HRS patients(56% vs. 33.8%,P<0.001). Waitlist mortality was the highest early after listing and the distinct alteration of slope at survival curve showed that the benefits of ITT-LDLT occurred within the first month after listing. Perioperative outcomes and 5-year patient survival were comparable for MELD>25(88% vs. 85.4%,P=0.279) and MELD>25 and HRS patients(77% vs. 76.4%,P=0.701) after LDLT and DDLT respectively. LDLT group has a higher rate of renal recovery by 1-month(77.4% vs. 59.1%,P=0.003) and by 3-month(86.1% vs, 74.5%,P=0.029) while the long-term eGFR was similar between the 2 groups. ITT-LDLT reduced the hazard of mortality(HR=0.387-0.552)across all MELD strata. CONCLUSIONS: The ITT-LDLT reduced waitlist mortality and allowed an earlier access to transplant. LDLT in high MELD/HRS patients were feasible, they had similar perioperative outcomes and better renal recovery, while the long-term survival and eGFR were comparable to DDLT.

We hypothesized that age is not sufficient, and that frailty measured by preadmission Palliative Performance Scale would be a predictor of outcomes. Improved ability to identify high-risk patients will improve clinicians' ability to provide appropriate palliative care, including engaging in shared decision-making about life-sustaining therapies. AIM: To evaluate whether preadmission Palliative Performance Scale predicts mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study of patients admitted with COVID-19. Palliative Performance Scale was calculated from the chart. Using logistic regression, Palliative Performance Scale was assessed as a predictor of mortality controlling for demographics, comorbidities, palliative care measures and socioeconomic status. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Patients older than 18 years of age admitted with COVID-19 to a single urban public hospital in New Jersey, USA. RESULTS: Of 443 admitted patients, we determined the Palliative Performance Scale score for 374. Overall mortality was 31% and 81% in intubated patients. In all, 36% (134) of patients had a low Palliative Performance Scale score. Compared with patients with a high score, patients with a low score were more likely to die, have do not intubate orders and be discharged to a facility. Palliative Performance Scale independently predicts mortality (odds ratio 2.89; 95% confidence interval 1.42-5.85). CONCLUSIONS: Preadmission Palliative Performance Scale independently predicts mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Improved predictors of mortality can help clinicians caring for patients with COVID-19 to discuss prognosis and provide appropriate palliative care including decisions about life-sustaining therapy.","Fiorentino, Michele; Pentakota, Sri Ram; Mosenthal, Anne C; Glass, Nina E",Palliat Med,465,16

A secondary aim was to investigate whether associations varied by age. METHODS: The cohort comprised patients in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) who tested positive for COVID-19 (N = 9,347). For each outcome, we fit piecewise logistic regression models with restricted cubic splines (knots at BMI of 23, 30, and 39), adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, VHA nursing home residence, and race/ethnicity. Supplemental analyses included age-by-BMI interaction terms (&#945; = 0.05). RESULTS: We found evidence of a nonlinear J-curve association between BMI and likelihood of hospitalization and mortality. BMI was associated with increased odds for hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality among patients with BMI 30 to 39 but decreased odds of hospitalization and mortality for patients with BMI 23 to 30. Patients under age 75 with BMI between 30 and 39 had increased odds for mortality with increasing BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Odds for severe outcomes with COVID-19 infection increased with increasing BMI for people with, but not without, obesity. This nonlinear relationship should be tested in future research. COVID-19 public health messages in VHA, and broadly, should incorporate information about risks associated with all classes of obesity, particularly for those under age 75.","Breland, Jessica Y; Wong, Michelle S; Steers, W Neil; Yuan, Anita H; Haderlein, Taona P; Washington, Donna L",Obesity (Silver Spring),465,16

To ensure that this resumption is both gradual and well-founded, we have devised a priority ranking plan. The flow charts we propose will help centres to identify priority patients according to a benefit/risk assessment. Diabetes holds a central place in the decision tree. Resumption patterns will vary from one centre to another according to human, physical and medical resources, and will need adjustment as the epidemic unfolds. Specific informed consent will be required. Screening of patients with obesity should be considered, based on available knowledge. If Covid-19 is suspected, surgery must be postponed. Emphasis must be placed on infection control measures to protect patients and healthcare professionals. Confinement is strongly advocated for patients for the first month post-operatively. Patient follow-up should preferably be by teleconsultation.","Kassir, R; Rebibo, L; Genser, L; Sterkers, A; Blanchet, M-C; Pattou, F; Msika, S",J Visc Surg,465,1
239977,239977,239977,COVID-19 Lockdowns: a Public Mental Health Ethics Perspective,19.432436,3.203786,2020,"Aim: International health authorities suggest that individuals aged 65 years and above and people with underlying comorbidities such as hypertension, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and obesity are at increased risk of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, the prevalence of risk factors is unknown in many countries. Therefore, we aimed to describe the distribution of these risk factors across Europe. Subject and methods: Prevalence of risk factors for severe COVID-19 was identified based on interviews from 73,274 Europeans aged 50+ participating in the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) in 2017. Burden of disease was estimated using population data from Eurostat. Results: A total of 75.3% of the study population (corresponding to approx. 60 million European men and 71 million women) had at least one risk factor for severe COVID-19, 45.9% (approx. 36 million men and 43 million women) had at least two factors, and 21.2% (approx. 17 million men and 20 million women) had at least three risk factors. The prevalence of underlying medical conditions ranged from 4.5% for cancer to 41.4% for hypertension, and the region-specific prevalence of having at least three risk factors ranged from 18.9% in Northern Europe to 24.6% in Eastern Europe. Conclusions: Information about the prevalence of risk factors might help authorities to identify the most vulnerable subpopulations with multiple risk factors of severe COVID-19 and thus to decide appropriate strategies to mitigate the pandemic.

In the past few years, new telecommunication-based practices, including various forms of e-rehabilitation have gained attention all over the world, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Telerehabilitation is an alternative way of delivering rehabilitation services in which information and communication technologies are used to expedite communication between the health care professional and the patient at a distant location. It can be beneficial to people in rural areas, especially individuals in isolated communities. At present, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced speedy adoption of telerehabilitation due to restricted traditional in-person visits all over the world, including KSA; however, no telerehabilitation guidelines are available in the country. Since specialized rehabilitation services are limited to main cities of the country, the provision of care by reaching out the underserved areas using telemedicine technology is deemed important. These guidelines were established collaboratively by panel of various rehabilitation experts with input from other practitioners in the field and strategic stakeholders. It will facilitate rehabilitation clinicians practicing in KSA providing consultation, counseling, education, assessment, monitoring, therapy, or follow-up to a patient remotely using telemedicine communication technologies.

A rapid and convenient point-of-care test (POCT) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus is of great importance for prompt and efficient control of these respiratory epidemics. Herein, a multichannel electrochemical immunoassay (MEIA) platform was developed based on a disposable screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) array for the on-site detection of SARS-CoV-2 and A(H1N1). The developed MEIA was constructed with eight channels and allowed rapid detection on a single array. On the SPCE surface, monoclonal antibodies against influenza A(H1N1) hemagglutinin (HA) protein or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were coated to capture the target antigens, which then interacted with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled detection antibody to form an immuno-sandwich complex. The results showed that the MEIA exhibited a broader linear range than ELISA and comparable sensitivity for A(H1N1) HA and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The detection results on 79 clinical samples for A(H1N1) suggested that the proposed MEIA platform showed comparable results with ELISA in sensitivity (with a positive rate of 100% for positive samples) but higher specificity, with a false-positive rate of 5.4% for negative samples versus that of 40.5% with ELISA. Thus, it offers great potential for the on-the-spot differential diagnosis of infected patients, which would significantly benefit the efficient control and prevent the spread of these infectious diseases in communities or resource-limited regions in the future.","Li, Jianyong; Lin, Rui; Yang, Yi; Zhao, Rongtao; Song, Shiping; Zhou, Yi; Shi, Jiye; Wang, Lihua; Song, Hongbin; Hao, Rongzhang",ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,465,31

METHODS: Constant, intermittent, and stepping-down SD strategies were modeled at 4 mean magnitudes (5%, 10 %, 15 % and 20 %), 2 time windows (40-days, 80-days), and 2 levels of personal caution (30 % and 50 %). RESULTS: The stepping-down strategy was the best long-term SD strategy to minimize the peak number of active COVID-19 cases and associated deaths. The stepping-down strategy also resulted in a reduction in total time required to SD over a two-year period by 6.5 % compared to an intermittent or constant SD strategy. An 80-day SD time-window was statistically more effective in maintaining control over the COVID-19 pandemic than a 40-day window. However, the results were dependent upon 50 % of people being cautious (engaging in personal protection measures). CONCLUSION: If people exercise caution while in public by protecting themselves (e.g., wearing a facemask, proper hand hygiene and avoid agglomeration) the magnitude and duration of SD necessary to maintain control over the pandemic can be reduced. Our models suggest that the most effective way to reduce SD over a two-year period is a stepping-down approach every 80 days. According to our model, this method would prevent a second peak and the number of intensive care units needed per day would be within the threshold of those currently available.","Kennedy, Deanna M; Zambrano, Gustavo José; Wang, Yiyu; Neto, Osmar Pinto",J Clin Virol,465,6

Clinical outcomes included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, access line thrombosis, ICU admission, intubation and mortality. MAIN RESULTS: Of 276 patients (mean age 59 ± 6.4 years, 47% female, 62% African American), 45 (16%) had a thrombotic endpoint. Each MOCHA parameter was independently associated with a thrombotic event (p<0.05) and &#8805; 2 abnormalities was associated with thrombotic endpoints (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.2-8.8) as were admission D-dimer &#8805; 2000 ng/mL (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5-6.6) and &#8805; 3000 ng/mL (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.6-7.9).

This study compared the performance of commercial enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) to detect IgG or total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and neutralizing antibodies (nAb). The diagnostic accuracy of five commercially available EIAs (Abbott, Euroimmun, EDI, ImmunoDiagnostics, and Roche) to detect IgG or total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated from cross-sectional samples of potential CCP donors that had prior molecular confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=214) and pre-pandemic emergency department patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=1,099). Of the 214 potential CCP donors, all were sampled >14 days since symptom onset and only a minority had been hospitalized due to COVID-19 (n=16 [7.5%]); 140 potential CCP donors were tested by all five EIAs and a microneutralization assay. When performed according to the manufacturers' protocol to detect IgG or total antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the sensitivity of each EIA ranged from 76.4% to 93.9%, and the specificity of each EIA ranged from 87.0% to 99.6%.

250299,250299,250299,The COVID-19 Innovation System,19.745749,3.244596,2021,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Viral respiratory infections are amongst the most common infections globally, with most of the world's population contracting at least one infection annually. Numerous plant species are used in traditional southern African healing systems to treat these diseases and to alleviate the symptoms. Despite this, the therapeutic potential of these plants against viral respiratory diseases remains poorly explored. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to document the southern African plant species used in traditional medicine to treat viral respiratory infections. We also examined the extent of scientific evaluations of southern African plant species against the respiratory-infective viruses, with the aim of stimulating interest in this area and focusing on future studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We undertook an extensive review of ethnobotanical books, reviews and primary scientific studies to identify southern African plants which are used in traditional southern African medicine to treat viral respiratory diseases. This information was used to identify gaps in the current research that require further study. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-seven southern African plant species were identified as traditional therapies for viral respiratory diseases. Surprisingly, only one of those species (as well as twenty-one other species not recorded for these purposes) has been evaluated for the ability to block respiratory virus production. Furthermore, most of these studies screened against a single viral strain and none of those studies examined the mechanism of action of the plant preparations. CONCLUSIONS: Despite well documented records of the use of southern African plants to treat respiratory viral diseases, the field is poorly explored. Nearly all of the plant species used in traditional healing systems to treat these diseases are yet to be tested. Substantial further work is required to verify the efficacy of these traditional medicines.","Cock, Ian E; Van Vuuren, Sandy F",J Ethnopharmacol,465,23

Objective: To assess clinical outcomes with convalescent plasma treatment vs placebo or standard of care in peer-reviewed and preprint publications or press releases of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Data Sources: PubMed, the Cochrane COVID-19 trial registry, and the Living Overview of Evidence platform were searched until January 29, 2021. Study Selection: The RCTs selected compared any type of convalescent plasma vs placebo or standard of care for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in any treatment setting. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two reviewers independently extracted data on relevant clinical outcomes, trial characteristics, and patient characteristics and used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. The primary analysis included peer-reviewed publications of RCTs only, whereas the secondary analysis included all publicly available RCT data (peer-reviewed publications, preprints, and press releases). Inverse variance-weighted meta-analyses were conducted to summarize the treatment effects. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Main Outcomes and Measures: All-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, clinical improvement, clinical deterioration, mechanical ventilation use, and serious adverse events. Results: A total of 1060 patients from 4 peer-reviewed RCTs and 10â¯722 patients from 6 other publicly available RCTs were included. The summary risk ratio (RR) for all-cause mortality with convalescent plasma in the 4 peer-reviewed RCTs was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.38), the absolute risk difference was -1.21% (95% CI, -5.29% to 2.88%), and there was low certainty of the evidence due to imprecision. Across all 10 RCTs, the summary RR was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.92 to 1.12) and there was moderate certainty of the evidence due to inclusion of unpublished data. Among the peer-reviewed RCTs, the summary hazard ratio was 1.17 (95% CI, 0.07 to 20.34) for length of hospital stay, the summary RR was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.20 to 2.87) for mechanical ventilation use (the absolute risk difference for mechanical ventilation use was -2.56% [95% CI, -13.16% to 8.05%]), and there was low certainty of the evidence due to imprecision for both outcomes. Limited data on clinical improvement, clinical deterioration, and serious adverse events showed no significant differences. Conclusions and Relevance: Treatment with convalescent plasma compared with placebo or standard of care was not significantly associated with a decrease in all-cause mortality or with any benefit for other clinical outcomes. The certainty of the evidence was low to moderate for all-cause mortality and low for other outcomes.","Janiaud, Perrine; Axfors, Cathrine; Schmitt, Andreas M; Gloy, Viktoria; Ebrahimi, Fahim; Hepprich, Matthias; Smith, Emily R; Haber, Noah A; Khanna, Nina; Moher, David; Goodman, Steven N; Ioannidis, John P A; Hemkens, Lars G",JAMA,465,21

This study aimed to estimate the willingness to be vaccinated and the socio-demographic and motivational correlates among Health Care Workers (HCWs) in French Guiana. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from January 22 to March 26, 2021 among a sample of HCWs in French Guiana. They were asked about their willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and vaccine hesitancy, vaccine uptake and vaccines attitudes. Factors associated with willingness to get vaccinated have been analyzed with ordinal logistic regression, using Stata software. Results: A total of 579 HCWs were interviewed, including 220 physicians and 200 nurses most often working in hospital (54%) or in the liberal sector (22%). Overall, 65.6% of respondents reported that they were willing or had already been vaccinated against COVID-19, while 24.3% of respondents reported that they did not want to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and 11.2% were unsure. HCWs were more willing to get vaccine if they were older, were worried about COVID-19 and were confident in the management of epidemic. Conversely, participants were less likely to have been vaccinated or willing to if they were nurses or of another non-medical profession, born in French Guiana, feared adverse effects, or if they did not trust pharmaceutical companies and management of the epidemic by authorities. Conclusion: Negative attitudes towards vaccines are a major public health concern among HCWs in French Guiana when considering the current active epidemic with Gamma VOC. General vaccine hesitancy and concerns about future side effects in particular represent important barriers. Low confidence in government and science are significant in COVID-19 vaccine refusal among non-medical staffs. Public health messaging with information on vaccine safety should be tailored to address these concerns. The specific challenges of HCWs from French Guiana must be taken into account.","Vignier, Nicolas Brureau Kepha Granier Sybille Breton Jacques Michaud Céline Gaillet Mélanie Agostini Camille Ballet Mathilde Nacher Mathieu Valdes Audrey Abboud Philippe Adenis Antoine Djossou Félix Epelboin Loïc Douine Maylis",Vaccines,465,16

We aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in daycare centres that remained open for key workers' children during a nationwide lockdown in France. METHODS: Children and staff who attended one of 22 daycare centres during a nationwide lockdown in France (between March 15 and May 9, 2020) were included in this cross-sectional, multicentre, seroprevalence study. Hospital staff not occupationally exposed to patients with COVID-19, or to children, were enrolled in a comparator group. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in children, daycare centre staff, and the comparator group. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in capillary whole blood was measured with a rapid chromatographic immunoassay. We computed raw prevalence as the percentage of individuals with a positive IgG or IgM test, and used Bayesian smoothing to account for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the assay. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04413968. FINDINGS: Between June 4 and July 3, 2020, we enrolled 327 children (mean age 1·9 [SD 0·9] years; range 5 months to 4·4 years), 197 daycare centre staff (mean age 40 [12] years), and 164 adults in the comparator group (42 [12] years). Positive serological tests were observed for 14 children (raw seroprevalence 4·3%; 95% CI 2·6-7·1) and 14 daycare centre staff (7·7%; 4·2-11·6). After accounting for imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the assay, we estimated that 3·7% (95% credible interval [95% CrI] 1·3-6·8) of the children and 6·8% (3·2-11·5) of daycare centre staff had SARS-CoV-2 infection. The comparator group fared similarly to the daycare centre staff; nine participants had a positive serological test (raw seroprevalence 5·5%; 95% CI 2·9-10·1), leading to a seroprevalence of 5·0% (95% CrI 1·6-9·8) after accounting for assay characteristics. An exploratory analysis suggested that seropositive children were more likely than seronegative children to have been exposed to an adult household member with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (six [43%] of 14 vs 19 [6%] of 307; relative risk 7·1 [95% CI 2·2-22·4]). INTERPRETATION: According to serological test results, the proportion of young children in our sample with SARS-CoV-2 infection was low. Intrafamily transmission seemed more plausible than transmission within daycare centres. Further epidemiological studies are needed to confirm this exploratory hypothesis.

CML is now managed as a chronic disease requiring both long-term treatment and close molecular monitoring in the majority of patients. AREAS COVERED: Evidence suggests that in a substantial number of patients who have achieved a stable deep molecular response (DMR), TKI treatment can be safely discontinued without loss of response. Therefore, treatment-free remission (TFR), through the achievement of a DMR, is increasingly regarded as a feasible treatment goal in about 20 to 40% CML patients. Nevertheless, a proportion of patients with chronic phase CML treated with TKIs remain in stable MMR and do not achieve a DMR.

Most works follow the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartmental framework, modeling the epidemic with a system of ordinary differential equations. Alternative formulations using a partial differential equation (PDE) to incorporate both spatial and temporal resolution have also been introduced, with their numerical results showing potentially powerful descriptive and predictive capacity. In the present work, we introduce a new variation to such models by using delay differential equations (DDEs). The dynamics of many infectious diseases, including COVID-19, exhibit delays due to incubation periods and related phenomena. Accordingly, DDE models allow for a natural representation of the problem dynamics, in addition to offering advantages in terms of computational time and modeling, as they eliminate the need for additional, difficult-to-estimate, compartments (such as exposed individuals) to incorporate time delays. Here, we introduce a DDE epidemic model in both an ordinary- and partial differential equation framework. We present a series of mathematical results assessing the stability of the formulation. We then perform several numerical experiments, validating both the mathematical results and establishing model's ability to reproduce measured data on realistic problems.","Guglielmi, Nicola; Iacomini, Elisa; Viguerie, Alex",,465,10

The present study explores the inhibitory potential of characteristic and non-characteristic Withania somnifera (Indian ginseng) phytochemicals (n &#8776; 100) against SARS-Cov-2 Mpro protein. Molecular docking studies revealed that certain W. somnifera compounds exhibit superior binding potential (-6.16 to -12.27 kcal/mol) compared to the standard inhibitors (-2.55 to -6.16 kcal/mol) including nelfinavir and lopinavir. The non-characteristic compounds (quercetin-3-rutinoside-7-glucoside, rutin and isochlorogenic acid B) exhibited higher inhibitory potential in comparison to characteristic W. somnifera compounds withanolide and withanone. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies of the complex for 100 ns confirm favorable and stable binding of the lead molecule. The MMPBSA calculation of the last 10 ns of the protein-ligand complex trajectory exhibited stable binding of quercetin-3-rutinoside-7-glucoside at the active site of SARS-Cov-2 Mpro. Taken together, the study demonstrates that the non-characteristic compounds present in W. somnifera possess enhanced potential to bind SARS-Cov-2 Mpro active site.

We demonstrate that normal breathing results in an absorption-desorption cycle inside facemasks, in which supersaturated air is absorbed by the mask fibers during expiration, followed by evaporation during inspiration of dry environmental air. For double-layered cotton masks, which have considerable heat capacity, the temperature of inspired air rises above room temperature, and the effective increase in relative humidity can exceed 100%. We propose that the recently reported, disease-attenuating effect of generic facemasks is dominated by the strong humidity increase of inspired air. This elevated humidity promotes mucociliary clearance of pathogens from the lungs, both before and after an infection of the upper respiratory tract has occurred. Effective mucociliary clearance can delay and reduce infection of the lower respiratory tract, thus mitigating disease severity. This mode of action suggests that masks can benefit the wearer even after an infection in the upper respiratory tract has occurred, complementing the traditional function of masks to limit person-to-person disease transmission. This potential therapeutical use should be studied further.","Courtney, Joseph M; Bax, Ad",Biophys J,465,24

Influenza epidemic pattern was bimodal in 2016-2017 and 2018-2019 seasons, however, influenza viruses have rarely been circulating in spring, 2020 in Korea. Although multiple factors could affect the size of influenza epidemic, extensive application of nonpharmaceutical interventions including mask wearing and social distancing in response to COVID-19 seems to be a major factor of reduced influenza epidemic. Social distancing measures with high feasibility and high acceptability should be implemented even if severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines are developed in the future. Establishment of guideline for workplace social distancing is needed and it would contribute to reduce disease burden of influenza, especially in vaccine mismatch year.","Noh, Ji Yun; Seong, Hye; Yoon, Jin Gu; Song, Joon Young; Cheong, Hee Jin; Kim, Woo Joo",J Korean Med Sci,465,1

In a tertiary hospital contending with COVID-19 during a dengue epidemic, a triage strategy of routine COVID-19 testing for febrile patients with viral prodromes was used. All febrile patients with viral prodromes and no epidemiologic risk for COVID-19 were first admitted to a designated ward for COVID-19 testing, where enhanced personal protective equipment was used by healthcare workers until COVID-19 was ruled out. From January to May 2020, 11,086 admissions were screened for COVID-19; 868 cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed in our institution, along with 380 cases of dengue. Only 8.5% (943/11,086) of suspected COVID-19 cases were concurrently tested for dengue serology due to a compatible overlapping clinical syndrome, and dengue was established as an alternative diagnosis in 2% (207/10,218) of suspected COVID-19 cases that tested negative. There were eight COVID-19 cases with likely false-positive dengue serology and one probable COVID-19/dengue coinfection. From April to May 2020, 251 admissions presenting as viral prodromes with no respiratory symptoms were screened; of those, 15 cases had COVID-19, and 2/15 had false-positive dengue IgM. Epidemiology investigations showed no healthcare-associated transmission. In a dengue epidemic season coinciding with a COVID-19 pandemic, dengue was established as an alternative diagnosis in a minority of COVID-19 suspects, likely due to early availability of basic diagnostics. Routine screening of patients with viral prodromes during a dual outbreak of COVID-19 and dengue enabled containment of COVID-19 cases masquerading as dengue with false-positive IgM.","Wee, Liang En; Cherng, Benjamin Pei Zhi; Conceicao, Edwin Philip; Goh, Kenneth Choon-Meng; Wan, Wei Yee; Ko, Kwan Ki Karrie; Aung, May Kyawt; Sim, Xiang Ying Jean; Wijaya, Limin; Ling, Moi Lin; Venkatachalam, Indumathi",Am J Trop Med Hyg,465,1

The main objective of this article is to assess challenges that arise from complex intersections between the threat multipliers and to provide guidance on how to address them effectively. We consider the limitations of our knowledge including ""unknown unknowns."" During emergency evacuation, practicing social distancing can be very difficult. However, people are going to take action to respond to rising waters, even if it means breaking quarantine.

Our study describes the clinical characteristics and outcomes for all intensive care unit (ICU) patients admitted across the Cleveland Clinic enterprise, a 10-hospital health care system in northeast Ohio, serving more than 2.7 million people. Methods: We analyzed the quality data registry for clinical characteristics and outcomes of all COVID-19-confirmed ICU admissions. Differences in outcomes from other health care systems and published cohorts from other parts of the world were delineated. Results: Across our health care system, 495 COVID-19 patients were admitted from March 15 to June 1, 2020. Mean patient age was 67.3 years, 206 (41.6%) were females, and 289 (58.4%) were males. Mean Acute Physiology Score was 45.3, and mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III score was 60.5. In total, 215 patients (43.3%) were intubated for a mean duration of 9.2 days. Mean ICU and hospital length of stay were 7.4 and 13.9 days, respectively, while mean ICU and hospital mortality rates were 18.4% and 23.8%. Conclusion: Our health care system cohort is the fourth largest to be reported. Lower ICU and hospital mortality and length of stay were seen compared to most other published reports. Better preparedness and state-level control of the surge in COVID-19 infections are likely the reasons for these better outcomes. Future research is needed to further delineate differences in mortality and length of stay across health care systems and over time.","Fadel, Francois Abi; Al-Jaghbeer, Mohammed; Kumar, Sany; Griffiths, Lori; Wang, Xiaofeng; Han, Xiaozhen; Burton, Robert",,465,16

Since its first appearance in December 2019, the outbreak has already caused over 5.8 million infections worldwide (till 29 May 2020), with more than 0.35 million deaths. Early virus-mediated immune suppression is believed to be one of the unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and contributes at least partially to the viral pathogenesis. In this study, we identified the key viral interferon antagonists of SARS-CoV-2 and compared them with two well-characterized SARS-CoV interferon antagonists, PLpro and orf6. Here we demonstrated that the SARS-CoV-2 nsp13, nsp14, nsp15 and orf6, but not the unique orf8, could potently suppress primary interferon production and interferon signalling. Although SARS-CoV PLpro has been well-characterized for its potent interferon-antagonizing, deubiquitinase and protease activities, SARS-CoV-2 PLpro, despite sharing high amino acid sequence similarity with SARS-CoV, loses both interferon-antagonising and deubiquitinase activities. Among the 27 viral proteins, SARS-CoV-2 orf6 demonstrated the strongest suppression on both primary interferon production and interferon signalling. Orf6-deleted SARS-CoV-2 may be considered for the development of intranasal live-but-attenuated vaccine against COVID-19.","Yuen, Chun-Kit; Lam, Joy-Yan; Wong, Wan-Man; Mak, Long-Fung; Wang, Xiaohui; Chu, Hin; Cai, Jian-Piao; Jin, Dong-Yan; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Kok, Kin-Hang",Emerg Microbes Infect,465,20

Although presumed to induce T cell-mediated immunity, whether tumor elimination depends on bacteria-specific or tumor-specific immunity is unknown. Herein we show that BCG-induced bladder tumor elimination requires CD4 and CD8 T cells, although augmentation or inhibition of bacterial antigen-specific T cell responses does not alter the efficacy of BCG-induced tumor elimination. In contrast, BCG stimulates long-term tumor-specific immunity that primarily depends on CD4 T cells. We demonstrate that BCG therapy results in enhanced effector function of tumor-specific CD4 T cells, mainly through enhanced production of IFN-Î³. Accordingly, BCG-induced tumor elimination and tumor-specific immune memory require tumor cell expression of the IFN-Î³ receptor, but not MHC class II. Our findings establish that a bacterial immunotherapy for cancer is capable of inducing tumor immunity, an antitumor effect that results from enhanced function of tumor-specific CD4 T cells, and ultimately requires tumor-intrinsic IFN-Î³ signaling, via a mechanism that is distinct from other tumor immunotherapies.","Antonelli, Anthony C; Binyamin, Anna; Hohl, Tobias M; Glickman, Michael S; Redelman-Sidi, Gil",Proc.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study that used a random sample of non-hospitalized patients from the primary care management division of the Healthcare Area of Leon (58 RT-qPCR-positive cases and 52 RT-qPCR-negative cases). Information regarding symptoms was collected and all patients were simultaneously tested using two rapid diagnostic tests - RDTs (Combined - cRDT and Differentiated - dRDT). The association between symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 infection was evaluated by non-conditional logistic regression, with estimation of Odds Ratio. RESULTS: A total of 110 subjects were studied, 52% of whom were women (mean age: 48.2±11.0 years). There were 42.3% of negative RT-qPCRs that were positive in some RDTs. Fever over 38°C (present in 35.5% of cases) and anosmia (present in 41.8%) were the symptoms most associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, a relationship that remained statistically significant in patients with negative RT-qPCR and some positive RDT (aOR=6.64; 95%CI=1.33-33.13 and aOR=19.38; 95% CI=3.69-101.89, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: RT-qPCR is the technique of choice in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but it is not exempt from false negatives. Our results show that patients who present mild or moderate symptoms with negative RT-qPCR, but with fever and/or anosmia, should be considered as suspicious cases and should be evaluated with other diagnostic methods.","López de la Iglesia, J; Fernández-Villa, T; Rivero, A; Carvajal, A; Bay Simon, E; Martínez Martínez, M; Argüello, H; Puente, H; Fernández Vázquez, J P",Semergen,465,29

Activated microglia/macrophages (mi/ma) and retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) play an active role in every stage of disease progression. Systemic therapies that can target these cells and address both inflammation and neovascularization will broaden the impact of existing therapies and potentially open new avenues for early AMD where there are no viable therapies. Utilizing a clinically relevant rat model of AMD that mirrors many aspects that of human AMD pathological events, we show that systemic hydroxyl-terminated polyamidoamine dendrimer-triamcinolone acetonide conjugate (D-TA) is selectively taken up by the injured mi/ma and RPE (without the need for targeting ligands). D-TA suppresses choroidal neovascularization significantly (by >80%, >50-fold better than free drug), attenuates inflammation in the choroid and retina, by limiting macrophage infiltration in the pathological area, significantly suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-angiogenic factors, with minimal side effects to healthy ocular tissue and other organs. In ex vivo studies on human postmortem diabetic eyes, the dendrimer is also taken up into choroidal macrophages. These results suggest that the systemic hydroxyl dendrimer-drugs can offer new avenues for therapies in treating early/dry AMD and late/neovascular AMD alone, or in combination with current anti-VEGF therapies. This hydroxyl dendrimer platform but conjugated to a different drug is undergoing clinical trials for severe COVID-19, potentially paving the way for faster clinical translation of similar compounds for ocular and retinal disorders.","Kambhampati, Siva P; Bhutto, Imran A; Wu, Tony; Ho, Katie; McLeod, D Scott; Lutty, Gerard A; Kannan, Rangaramanujam M",J Control Release,465,16

Although our knowledge of the mechanics of virus transmission and the immune response has been substantially demystified, concerns over reinfection, susceptibility of the elderly and whether asymptomatic children promote transmission remain unanswered. There are also uncertainties about the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and why there are variations in clinical presentations and why some patients suffer from long lasting symptoms-""the long haulers.""

The occurrence of several deleterious events, such as hyperactivation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and oxidative and inflammatory stress, contributes to the development of small vessel disease in PAH. Small resistance arteries are found at various points through the arterial tree, act as the major site of vascular resistance, and actively regulate local tissue perfusion. Experimental and clinical studies demonstrate that alterations in small resistance artery properties are important features of PAH pathophysiology. Diseased small vessels in PAH show decreased lumens, thicker walls, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress and inflammation. These events may lead to altered blood flow supply to tissues and organs, and can increase the risk of thrombosis. Notably, PAH is prevalent among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, in whom evidence of small vessel disease leading to cardiovascular pathology is reported. The SARS-Cov2 virus, responsible for COVID-19, achieves cell entry through an S (spike) high-affinity protein binding to the catalytic domain of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a negative regulator of the RAS pathway. Therefore, it is crucial to examine the relationship between small resistance artery disease, ACE2, and PAH, to understand COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The scope of the present review is to briefly summarize available knowledge on the role of small resistance artery disease and ACE2 in PAH, and critically discuss their clinical relevance in the context of cardiovascular pathology associated to COVID-19.","Galán, María; Jiménez-Altayó, Francesc",Front Cardiovasc Med,465,20

We compared the epidemiological features of patients with COVID-19 in the context of containment policies between the first and second waves. METHODS: We retrieved information on the first 1038 cases detected in Hong Kong (23 January to 25 April 2020) to analyse the epidemiological characteristics including age/gender-specific incidence, clustering, reproduction number (Rt ) and containment delay; in relation to the containment measures implemented. Factors associated with containment delay were evaluated by multiple linear regression analysis with age, gender, epidemic wave and infection source as covariates. A time series of 5-day moving average was plotted to examine the changes across the two epidemic waves. RESULTS: The incidence and mortality (135.5 and 0.5 per 1 000 000 population) was among the lowest in the world. Aggressive escalation of border control correlated with reductions in Rt from 1.35 to 0.57 and 0.92 to 0.18, and aversions of 450 and 1650 local infections during the first and second waves, respectively. Implementing COVID-19 tests for overseas returners correlated with an upsurge of asymptomatic case detection, and shortened containment delay in the second wave. Medium-sized cluster events in the first wave were family gatherings, whereas those in the second wave were leisure activities among youngsters. Containment delay was associated with older age (adjusted OR (AOR)=1.01, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.02, p=0.040), male gender (AOR=1.41, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.96, p=0.039) and local cases (AOR=11.18, 95% CI 7.43 to 16.83, p<0.001), and with significant improvement in the second wave compared with the first wave (average: 6.8 vs 3.7 days). A higher incidence rate was observed for males, raising possibility of gender predilection in susceptibility of developing symptoms. CONCLUSION: Prompt and stringent all-round containment strategies represent successful measures in pandemic control. These findings could inform formulation and implementation of pandemic mitigation strategies.","Wong, Martin C S; Ng, Rita W Y; Chong, Ka Chun; Lai, Christopher K C; Huang, Junjie; Chen, Zigui; Boon, Siaw S; Chan, Paul K S",,465,16

Methods Cross-sectional study of 20 patients (median age 43 years; interquartile range, 37-63 years; 50% male). All patients underwent LUS and chest CT on the day of ED admission. Each hemithorax was divided into 6 segments with similar landmarks, and equivalent scores (sc) of lesion severity were defined for both methods. The number of affected segments on LUS (LUSseg) was divided into tertiles (0-1, 2-5, and &#8805;6), and compared with number of affected segments on CT (CTseg), LUSsc, CTsc, and percentage of affected lung parenchyma through visual analysis (CTvis). ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables, chi-square test for categorical variables, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to define optimal cutoff points were performed. P&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Median LUSsc, CTsc, CTseg, and CTvis were significantly different between groups.

After performing a literature review of tracheostomies during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, we synthesized important learning points from these experiences and suggest an approach for perioperative teams involved in these procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.Multidisciplinary teams should be involved in decisions regarding timing and appropriateness of the procedure. As the theoretical risk of disease transmission is increased during aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), stringent infectious precautions are warranted. Personal protective equipment (PPE) should be available and worn by all personnel present during tracheostomy. The number of people in the room should be limited to those absolute necessary. Using the most experienced available operators will minimize the total time that staff are exposed to an infectious aerosolized environment. An approach that secures the airway in the safest and quickest manner will minimize the time any part of the airway is open to the environment. Deep neuromuscular blockade (train of four ratio = 0) will facilitate surgical exposure and prevent aerosolization due to patient movement or coughing. For percutaneous tracheostomies, the bronchoscopist should be able to reintubate if needed. Closed-loop communication must occur at all times among members of the team. If possible after tracheostomy is performed, waiting until the patient is virus free before changing the cannula or downsizing may reduce the chances of healthcare worker infection.Tracheostomies in COVID-19 patients present themselves as extremely high-risk for all members of the procedural team. To mitigate risk, systematic meticulous planning of each procedural step is warranted along with strict adherence to local/institutional protocols.","Gosling, Andre F; Bose, Somnath; Gomez, Ernest; Parikh, Mihir; Cook, Charles; Sarge, Todd; Shaefi, Shahzad; Leibowitz, Akiva",,465,24

Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, FFR supplies are dwindling in many health systems, necessitating re-use of potentially contaminated FFR. Multiple decontamination solutions have been developed to meet this pressing need, including systems designed for bulk decontamination of FFR using vaporous hydrogen peroxide or ultraviolet-C (UV-C) radiation. However, the large scale on which these devices operate may not be logistically practical for small or rural health care settings or for ad hoc use at points-of-care. METHODS: Here, we present the Synchronous UV Decontamination System, a novel device for rapidly deployable, point-of-care decontamination using UV-C germicidal irradiation. We designed a compact, easy-to-use device capable of delivering over 2 J cm2 of UV-C radiation in one minute. RESULTS: We experimentally tested Synchronous UV Decontamination System' microbicidal capacity and found that it eliminates near all virus from the surface of tested FFRs, with less efficacy against pathogens embedded in the inner layers of the masks. CONCLUSIONS: This short decontamination time should enable care-providers to incorporate decontamination of FFR into a normal donning and doffing routine following patient encounters.","Kayani, Badar J; Weaver, Davis T; Gopalakrishnan, Vishhvaan; King, Eshan S; Dolson, Emily; Krishnan, Nikhil; Pelesko, Julia; Scott, Michael J; Hitomi, Masahiro; Cadnum, Jennifer L; Li, Daniel F; Donskey, Curtis J; Scott, Jacob G; Charnas, Ian",Am. j. infect. control,465,30

ACE2 is abundantly expressed in a variety of cells residing in many different human organs. In human physiology, ACE2 is a pivotal counter-regulatory enzyme to ACE by the breakdown of angiotensin II, the central player in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and the main substrate of ACE2. Many factors have been associated with both altered ACE2 expression and COVID-19 severity and progression, including age, sex, ethnicity, medication, and several co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. Although ACE2 is widely distributed in various human tissues and many of its determinants have been well recognised, ACE2-expressing organs do not equally participate in COVID-19 pathophysiology, implying that other mechanisms are involved in orchestrating cellular infection resulting in tissue damage. Reports of pathologic findings in tissue specimens of COVID-19 patients are rapidly emerging and confirm the established role of ACE2 expression and activity in disease pathogenesis. Identifying pathologic changes caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucially important as it has major implications for understanding COVID-19 pathophysiology and the development of evidence-based treatment strategies. Currently, many interventional strategies are being explored in ongoing clinical trials, encompassing many drug classes and strategies, including antiviral drugs, biological response modifiers, and RAAS inhibitors. Ultimately, prevention is key to combat COVID-19 and appropriate measures are being taken accordingly, including development of effective vaccines. In this review, we describe the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 pathophysiology, including factors influencing ACE2 expression and activity in relation to COVID-19 severity. In addition, we discuss the relevant pathological changes resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we highlight a selection of potential treatment modalities for COVID-19. © 2020 The Authors.

We previously found a yeast-2-hybrid screen interaction of the SARS-CoV SUD with human poly(A)-binding protein (PABP)-interacting protein 1 (Paip1), a stimulator of protein translation. Here, we validate SARS-CoV SUD:Paip1 interaction by size-exclusion chromatography, split-yellow fluorescent protein, and co-immunoprecipitation assays, and confirm such interaction also between the corresponding domain of SARS-CoV-2 and Paip1. The three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV SUD (""macrodomain II"", Mac2) in complex with the middle domain of Paip1, determined by X-ray crystallography and small-angle X-ray scattering, provides insights into the structural determinants of the complex formation. In cellulo, SUD enhances synthesis of viral but not host proteins via binding to Paip1 in pBAC-SARS-CoV replicon-transfected cells.

METHODS: This was a prospective observational study including all consecutive adults hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection. When the first nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA (day 0), additional samples were obtained on days + 3, + 5, + 7 and then once every 7 days until virus detection was negative. PVS was defined as the duration of shedding of at least 21 days after diagnosis. The primary endpoint of this study was the prevalence of PVS. RESULTS: Data were obtained regarding 121 consecutive hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (median age 66 years, male sex 65.3%). Overall, the prevalence of PVS was 38% (46/121 patients). According to univariate analysis, factors associated with PVS were immunosuppression (6.7% vs 21.7%, p = 0.02), increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels (&#8805; 35 ng/ml) at the time of diagnosis (43.4% vs 67.3%, p = 0.02), time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis (median days 7.0 vs 3.5, p = 0.001), intensive care unit admission (22.7% vs 43.5%, p = 0.02), and need for invasive mechanical ventilation (20.0% vs 41.3%, p = 0.01). The multivariate analysis indicated that immunosuppression, increased IL-6 levels at the time of diagnosis, time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis, and need for mechanical ventilation were independent factors associated with PVS. CONCLUSIONS: PVS was detected in up to 38% of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and was strongly associated with immunosuppression, increased IL-6 levels, and the need for mechanical ventilation.","Vena, Antonio; Taramasso, Lucia; Di Biagio, Antonio; Mikulska, Malgorzata; Dentone, Chiara; De Maria, Andrea; Magnasco, Laura; Nicolini, Laura Ambra; Bruzzone, Bianca; Icardi, Giancarlo; Orsi, Andrea; Pelosi, Paolo; Ball, Lorenzo; Battaglini, Denise; Brunetti, Iole; Loconte, Maurizio; Patroniti, Nicolò A; Robba, Chiara; Bavastro, Martina; Cerchiaro, Matteo; Giacobbe, Daniele Roberto; Schiavetti, Irene; Berruti, Marco; Bassetti, Matteo",,465,16

However, severe acute respiratory disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is common and associated with mortality in patients who require hospitalization. The etiology of susceptibility to severe lung injury remains unclear. Angiotensin II, converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) from angiotensin I and metabolized by ACE 2 (ACE2), plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of lung injury. ACE2 is identified as an essential receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter the cell. The binding of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 leads to the exhaustion and down-regulation of ACE2. The interaction and imbalance between ACE and ACE2 result in an unopposed angiotensin II. Considering that the ACE insertion (I)/deletion (D) gene polymorphism contributes to the ACE level variability in general population, in which mean ACE level in DD carriers is approximately twice that in II carriers, we propose a hypothesis of genetic predisposition to severe lung injury in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. It is plausible that the ACE inhibitors and ACE receptor blockers may have the potential to prevent and to treat the acute lung injury after SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially for those with the ACE genotype associated with high ACE level.","Zheng, Haoyi; Cao, J Jane",Am J Pathol,465,25

The molecular mechanisms driving failure of the alveolar barrier upon severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV­2) infection remain incompletely understood. The Na,K­ATPase is an adhesion molecule and a plasma membrane transporter that is critically required for proper alveolar epithelial function by both promoting barrier integrity and resolution of excess alveolar fluid, thus enabling appropriate gas exchange. However, numerous SARS-CoV­2-mediated and COVID­19-related signals directly or indirectly impair the function of the Na,K-ATPase, thereby potentially contributing to disease progression. In this Perspective, we highlight some of the putative mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-driven dysfunction of the Na,K­ATPase, focusing on expression, maturation and trafficking of the transporter. A therapeutic mean to selectively inhibit the maladaptive signals that impair the Na,K-ATPase upon SARS-CoV­2 infection might be effective in reestablishing the alveolar epithelial barrier and promoting alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) and thus advantageous in patients with COVID­19-associated ARDS.","Kryvenko, Vitalii; Vadász, István","Am. j. physiol., lung cell. mol. physiol",465,24

METHODS: All the outpatient clinical activities during the 4 weeks following the national lockdown (March 9-April 3, 2020) in the Department of Urology of the Trento Province, Italy, were reviewed and categorized. Expert staff members examined the electronic records, selecting whether the clinic appointments should be canceled or confirmed (via telephone consultation or face-to-face visit). The rate, indication, and modality of visits were investigated. RESULTS: Overall, 415 of 928 (45%) scheduled patients canceled their clinic appointment themselves or were canceled by staff members without rescheduling. The remaining 523 (55%) cases were screened undergoing telephone consultation in 295 (56%) and face-to-face visit in 228 (44%). The rate of face-to-face visit decreased from 63% to 9% during week 1 and 4, respectively. Seventy-four percent of face-to-face visits regarded suspected recurrent or new onset malignancy or potentially dangerous clinical conditions (severe urinary symptoms or complicated urinary stones or infection). The median age of patients in the face-to-face and telephone groups was 59 (range 20-69) and 65 years old (range 37-88), respectively. CONCLUSION: A pandemic is a dynamic scenario, requiring reorganization and flexibility of the healthcare delivery. Forty-five percent visits were canceled without rescheduling. Although a minimum portion of face-to-face visit (<10% 1 month after the lockdown) was preserved mostly for suspected malignancy or potentially life-threatening conditions, telemedicine proved a pragmatic approach allowing efficient screening of cases and adequate protection for patients and clinicians.","Luciani, Lorenzo Giuseppe; Mattevi, Daniele; Cai, Tommaso; Giusti, Guido; Proietti, Silvia; Malossini, Gianni",Urology,465,1

Clinically, respiratory tract symptoms as well as other organs disorders are observed in patients positively diagnosed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition, neurological symptoms, mainly anosmia, ageusia and headache were observed in many patients. Once in the central nervous system (CNS), the SARS-CoV-2 can reside either in a quiescent latent state, or eventually in actively state leading to severe acute encephalitis, characterized by neuroinflammation and prolonged neuroimmune activation. SRAS-CoV-2 requires angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell entry receptor. The expression of this receptor in endothelial cells of blood-brain barrier (BBB) shows that SRAS-CoV-2 may have higher neuroinvasive potential compared to known coronaviruses. This review summarizes available information regarding the impact of SRAS-CoV-2 in the brain and tended to identify its potential pathways of neuroinvasion. We offer also an understanding of the long-term impact of latently form of SARS-CoV-2 on the development of neurodegenerative disorders. As a conclusion, the persistent infection of SRAS-CoV-2 in the brain could be involved on human neurodegenerative diseases that evolve a gradual process, perhapes, over several decades.","ElBini Dhouib, Ines",Drug Discov Ther,465,28

Incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity suggest a contribution of additional genetic lesions to clinical manifestations and outcome. Some monogenic disorders may therefore actually be digenic. However, only a few digenic disorders have been reported, all discovered by candidate gene approaches applied to at least one locus. We propose here a two-locus genome-wide test for detecting digenic inheritance in WES data. This approach uses the gene as the unit of analysis and tests all pairs of genes to detect pairwise gene × gene interactions underlying disease. It is a case-only method, which has several advantages over classic case-control tests, in particular by avoiding recruitment of controls. Our simulation studies based on real WES data identified two major sources of type I error inflation in this case-only test: linkage disequilibrium and population stratification. Both were corrected by specific procedures. Moreover, our case-only approach is more powerful than the corresponding case-control test for detecting digenic interactions in various population stratification scenarios. Finally, we confirmed the potential of our unbiased, genome-wide approach by successfully identifying a previously reported digenic lesion in patients with craniosynostosis. Our case-only test is a powerful and timely tool for detecting digenic inheritance in WES data from patients.","Kerner, Gaspard; Bouaziz, Matthieu; Cobat, Aurélie; Bigio, Benedetta; Timberlake, Andrew T; Bustamante, Jacinta; Lifton, Richard P; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Abel, Laurent",Proc.

The proposed methods achieve fine optimization over a set of general modes that include: (i) maximum video quality, (ii) minimum bitrate, (iii) maximum encoding rate (previously minimum encoding time mode) and (iv) can be shown to improve upon the YouTube/Netflix default encoder mode settings over a set of opposing constraints to guarantee satisfactory performance. The dissertation describes the implementation of a codec-agnostic approach using different video coding standards (x265, VP9, AV1) on a wide range of videos derived from different video datasets. The results demonstrate that the optimal encoding parameters obtained from the Pareto front space can provide significant bandwidth savings without sacrificing video quality. This is achieved by the use of effective regression models that allow for the selection of video encoding settings that are jointly optimal in the encoding time, bitrate, and video quality space. The dissertation applies the proposed methods to x265, VP9, AV1 and using new GOP configurations in x265, delivering over 40% of the optimal encodings in two standard reference videos.","Esakki, Gangadharan",,465,26

Thanks to the accelerated development of anti-SARS-SoV-2 vaccines in less than a year since the start of the global pandemic, patients with cancer were quickly prioritised in early 2021 for vaccination, however dependent on the very unequal availability at the global level. Impaired immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in immunocompromised patients was rapidly reported as early as April 2021, although the vaccination fortunately appears to be generally effective without increasing the spacing. Worryingly, the humoral response of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is, however, considered insufficient in patients followed for HM, in particular when they are on anti-CD20 treatment. Thus, improving vaccination coverage by strengthening immune stimulation should be evaluated in patients under active treatment against cancer. Here, we discuss three different approaches: a third dose of early vaccine (repeated immune stimulation), heterologous prime-boost vaccination (multimodal immune stimulation) and a double-dose strategy (maximisation of immune response).

In addition to understanding the modes of transmission, the effectiveness of the mitigation methods also needs to be built into any effective model for making such predictions. We show that such complexities can be circumvented by appealing to scaling principles which lead to the emergence of universality in the transmission dynamics of the disease. The ensuing data collapse renders the transmission dynamics largely independent of geopolitical variations, the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies, population demographics, etc. We propose a simple two-parameter model -- the Blue Sky model -- and show that one class of transmission dynamics can be explained by a solution that lives at the edge of a blue sky bifurcation. In addition, the data collapse leads to an enhanced degree of predictability in the disease spread for several geographical scales which can also be realized in a model-independent manner as we show using a deep neural network. The methodology adopted in this work can potentially be applied to the transmission of other infectious diseases and new universality classes may be found. The predictability in transmission dynamics and the simplicity of our methodology can help in building policies for exit strategies and mitigation methods during a pandemic.","Paul, Ayan; Bhattacharjee, Jayanta Kumar; Pal, Akshay; Chakraborty, Sagar",,465,1

The inhalation of microplastics due to the wearing of masks has rarely been reported. The present study used different types of commonly used masks to conduct breathing simulation experiments and investigate microplastic inhalation risk. Microplastic inhalation caused by reusing masks that underwent various treatment processes was also tested. Results implied that wearing masks considerably reduces the inhalation risk of particles (e.g., granular microplastics and unknown particles) even when they are worn continuously for 720 h. Surgical, cotton, fashion, and activated carbon masks wearing pose higher fiber-like microplastic inhalation risk, while all masks generally reduced exposure when used under their supposed time (<4 h). N95 poses less fiber-like microplastic inhalation risk. Reusing masks after they underwent different disinfection pretreatment processes can increase the risk of particle (e.g., granular microplastics) and fiber-like microplastic inhalation. Ultraviolet disinfection exerts a relatively weak effect on fiber-like microplastic inhalation, and thus, it can be recommended as a treatment process for reusing masks if proven effective from microbiological standpoint. Wearing an N95 mask reduces the inhalation risk of spherical-type microplastics by 25.5 times compared with not wearing a mask.","Li, Lu; Zhao, Xiaoli; Li, Zhouyang; Song, Kang",J Hazard Mater,465,7

It mainly affects the lungs and common symptoms are fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumothorax has been noted to complicate Covid-19 cases requiring hospital admission, however the exact incidence and risk factors are still unknown. Discussion: We present a series of 3 cases of primary spontaneous pneumothorax with Covid-19 pneumonia. All cases in our series did not require positive pressure ventilation and none had any pre-existing lung disease. All were never smokers and had favourable outcomes despite having severe Covid-19 with a pneumothorax during the course of the disease. In our literature review we discuss several plausible mechanisms and risk factors resulting in a pneumothorax with Covid-19. Conclusion: Our cases are a reminder that an acute deterioration with hypoxia in a Covid-19 patient could indicate a pneumothorax. Pneumothorax is one of the reported complications in Covid-19 and clinician vigilance is required during assessment of patients, as both share the common symptom of breathlessness and therefore can mimic each other.","Hameed, Mansoor; Jamal, Wasim; Yousaf, Muhammad; Thomas, Merlin; Haq, Irfan Ul; Ahmed, Shakeel; Ahmed, Mushtaq; Khatib, Mohamad",Respir Med Case Rep,465,1

Objective: To evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Anhui and to identify predictors of viral clearance. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data collected from discharged patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. We compared clinical features between viral clearance and viral persistence, and evaluated factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 shedding using multiple linear regression. Results: Among the 83 patients involved in the study, the median age was 43 years, while 60.2% were male, 35.4% had comorbidities, and the mortality was zero. The median time from illness onset to admission was 5 days (interquartile range (IQR), 2-7 days), and the median time from the illness onset to SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection was 16 days (IQR, 13-18 days). The factors influencing viral clearance were as follows: (1) delayed admission (beta 1.057, 95% CI 0.810-1.304; p &#8804; 0.001) and (2) underlying comorbidities (beta 1.907, 95% CI 0.198-3.616; p = 0.029). No significant differences were observed in the length of stay (p = 0.246) and pneumonia between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients based on computed tomography (CT) (p = 0.124). Conclusions: Delayed admission and underlying comorbidities may effectively predict SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance. For those infected with SARS-CoV-2, even asymptomatic patients without any clinical symptoms should be traced and isolated. This practice may reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and slow the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the virus.

Vanadium dioxide (VO2) exhibits a first-order MI transition at 340 K. For more than half a century, it has been debated whether electronic correlation or the structural instability due to dimerised V ions is the more essential driving force behind this MI transition. Here, we show that an ultrahigh magnetic field of 500 T renders the insulator phase of tungsten (W)-doped VO2 metallic. The spin Zeeman effect on the d electrons of the V ions dissociates the dimers in the insulating phase, resulting in the delocalisation of electrons. Because the Mott-Hubbard gap essentially does not depend on the spin degree of freedom, the structural instability is likely to be the more essential driving force behind the MI transition.","Matsuda, Yasuhiro H.; Nakamura, Daisuke; Ikeda, Akihiko; Takeyama, Shojiro; Muraoka, Yuji; Suga, Yuki",,465,24

Studies show that despite the lower rate, purchases of unhealthy SSBs and sugar intake consumption from SSBs fell. There were greater reductions in SSB purchases among both lower socioeconomic groups and in subpopulations with higher SSB consumption. These subpopulations bear larger burdens from obesity and related diseases, suggesting that this policy improves health equity.

Heightened release of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1ß, IL-6 and IL-8, as well as ferritin from macrophages cultured in conditioned media from lung cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD and Orf3a was attenuated by glycyrrhizin. Importantly, Glycyrrhizin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells without exhibiting cytotoxicity at high doses. The dual ability of Glycyrrhizin to concomitantly halt virus replication and dampen proinflammatory mediators might constitute a viable therapeutic option in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gowda, Pruthvi; Patrick, Shruti; Joshi, Shanker Datt; Kumawat, Rajesh Kumar; Sen, Ellora",Cytokine,465,20

An in-depth analysis about both population and molecular epidemiology of this pathogen is needed. METHODS: MERS cases reported globally as of June 2020 were collected mainly from World Health Organization official reports, supplemented by other reliable sources. Determinants for case fatality and spatial diffusion of MERS were assessed with Logistic regressions and Cox proportional hazard models, respectively. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses were performed to examine the evolution and migration history of MERS-CoV. RESULTS: A total of 2562 confirmed MERS cases with 150 case clusters were reported with a case fatality rate of 32.7% (95% CI: 30.9â34.6%). Saudi Arabia accounted for 83.6% of the cases. Age of &#8805; 65 years old, underlying conditions and &#8805; 5 days delay in diagnosis were independent risk factors for death. However, a history of animal contact was associated with a higher risk (adjusted OR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.10-7.98) among female cases < 65 years but with a lower risk (adjusted OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.18-0.51) among male cases &#8805; 65 years old. Diffusion of the disease was fastest from its origin in Saudi Arabia to the east, and was primarily driven by the transportation network. The most recent sub-clade C5.1 (since 2013) was associated with non-synonymous mutations and a higher mortality rate. Phylogeographic analyses pointed to Riyadh of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates as the hubs for both local and international spread of MERS-CoV. CONCLUSIONS: MERS-CoV remains primarily locally transmitted in the Middle East, with opportunistic exportation to other continents and a potential of causing transmission clusters of human cases. Animal contact is associated with a higher risk of death, but the association differs by age and sex. Transportation network is the leading driver for the spatial diffusion of the disease. These findings how this pathogen spread are helpful for targeting public health surveillance and interventions to control endemics and to prevent a potential pandemic.","Zhang, An-Ran; Shi, Wen-Qiang; Liu, Kun; Li, Xin-Lou; Liu, Ming-Jin; Zhang, Wen-Hui; Zhao, Guo-Ping; Chen, Jin-Jin; Zhang, Xiao-Ai; Miao, Dong; Ma, Wei; Liu, Wei; Yang, Yang; Fang, Li-Qun",Infect Dis Poverty,465,16

In order to outline a standard/baseline model of care, we think that it can be useful to refer to already existing rehabilitative plans with a long-standing tradition in Italy, such as those ones prescribed for work-related respiratory diseases like pneumoconiosis, in which long-term outcomes share some clinical characteristics with post-infective lung fibrosis. Such programs include diagnostic procedures (spirometry, ECG, blood tests) and treatments like respiratory physio-kinesiotherapy and postural drainage of the lungs; mechanical pulmonary ventilation for rehabilitative purposes, with or without drugs, along with standard medical and, when required, oxygen therapy; inhalation therapies with mineral waters; physical activity and psychological support. In conclusion, we believe that spa facilities can be a proper setting for respiratory rehabilitation and that already existing programs employed in occupational medicine can be a good starting point to plan rehabilitative strategies for post-COVID-19 patients. In particular, health spa centers can be useful not only to offer tailored programs of physical rehabilitation but also to provide patients with a psychologically supportive and health-promoting environment. Further studies on the topic are advised to properly assess and quantify with adequate outcome measurements the beneficial effect of a spa-based rehabilitative program in post-COVID-19 patients.","Antonelli, Michele; Donelli, Davide",Int J Biometeorol,465,26

To enter human cells, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-RBD) initially binds to the peptidase domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2-PD). Using peptides to inhibit SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding to ACE2 is a potential therapeutic solution for COVID-19. A previous study identified a 23-mer peptide (SBP1) that bound to SARS-CoV-2-RBD with comparable KD to ACE2. We employed computational protein design and molecular dynamics (MD) to design SARS-CoV-2-RBD 25-mer peptide binders (SPB25) with better predicted binding affinity than SBP1. Using residues 21-45 of the &#945;1 helix of ACE2-PD as the template, our strategy is employing Rosetta to enhance SPB25 binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2-RBD and avoid disrupting existing favorable interactions by using residues that have not been reported to form favorable interactions with SARS-CoV-2-RBD as designed positions. Designed peptides with better predicted binding affinities, by Rosetta, than SPB25 were subjected to MD validation. The MD results show that five designed peptides (SPB25F8N, SPB25F8R, SPB25L25R, SPB25F8N/L25R, and SPB25F8R/L25R) have better predicted binding affinities, by the MM-GBSA method, than SPB25 and SBP1. This study developed an approach to design SARS-CoV-2-RBD peptide binders, and these peptides may be promising candidates as potential SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.","Sitthiyotha, Thassanai; Chunsrivirot, Surasak",J Phys Chem B,465,26

CDWs have been observed and extensively studied in many materials since their first discovery in 1972. Yet they present ample opportunities for discovery. Here, we report a large tunability in the optical response of a quasi-2D CDW material, 1T-TaS2, upon incoherent light illumination at room temperature. We hypothesize that the observed tunability is a consequence of light-induced rearrangement of CDW stacking across the layers of 1T-TaS2. Our model, based on this hypothesis, agrees reasonably well with experiments suggesting that the interdomain CDW interaction is a vital potentially knob to control the phase of strongly correlated materials.","Li, Weijian; Naik, Gururaj V",Nano lett,465,16

Currently, COVID-19 vaccine rollouts are finally upon us carrying the hope of herd immunity once a sufficient proportion of the population has been vaccinated or infected, as a new horizon. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants brought concerns since, as the virus is exposed to environmental selection pressures, it can mutate and evolve, generating variants that may possess enhanced virulence. Codon usage analysis is a strategy to elucidate the evolutionary pressure of the viral genome suffered by different hosts, as possible cause of the emergence of new variants. Therefore, to get a better picture of the SARS-CoV-2 codon bias, we first identified the relative codon usage rate of all Betacoronaviruses lineages. Subsequently, we correlated putative cognate transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNAs) to reveal how those viruses adapt to hosts in relation to their preferred codon usage. Our analysis revealed seven preferred codons located in three different open reading frame which appear preferentially used by SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the tRNA adaptation analysis indicates a wide strategy of competition between the virus and mammalian as principal hosts highlighting the importance to reinforce the genomic monitoring to prompt identify any potential adaptation of the virus into new potential hosts which appear to be crucial to prevent and mitigate the pandemic.","Lopes, Elisson N; Fonseca, Vagner; Frias, Diego; Tosta, Stephane; Salgado, Álvaro; Assunção Vialle, Ricardo; Paulo Eduardo, Toscano S; Barreto, Fernanda K; Ariston de Azevedo, Vasco; Guarino, Michele; Angeletti, Silvia; Ciccozzi, Massimo; Junior Alcantara, Luiz C; Giovanetti, Marta",J Med Virol,465,20

This study evaluated a novel patient-centered method for constructing a longitudinal ultrasound score in RA patients. METHODS: Fifty-four RA patients starting intravenous tocilizumab were evaluated with power Doppler ultrasound (PDUS) of 34 joints and DAS28-ESR was assessed at baseline and weeks 4, 12, 16, and 24. The sentinel joint score (SJS) was derived from the reduced subset of joints with PDUS &#8805; 1 at baseline. Total PDUS (tPDUS) score and US7 were also calculated. Changes in tPDUS and SJS were correlated. Effect sizes were calculated for tPDUS, SJS, and US7. The proportion of ""flipped"" joints without baseline PDUS signal that later developed PDUS signal was estimated. RESULTS: At baseline, 1236/1829 joints scanned (67.5%) did not have PDUS signal. The proportion of ""flipped"" joints at 24 weeks was 5.6% for &#8805; 1, 2.9% for &#8805; 2, and 1.0% for = 3 PD. tPDUS and SJS scores were highly correlated (r = 0.91 to 0.97). Overall the effect sizes for tPDUS, SJS, and US7 increased over 24 weeks, where SJS was the highest (SJS 1.00 4-week, 1.07 12-week, 1.26 24-week) and tPDUS and US7 were comparable (tPDUS 0.32 4-week, 0.52 12-week, 0.84 24-week; US7 0.23 4-week, 0.52 12-week, 0.74 24-week). CONCLUSION: In RA patients starting a biologic, scanning only joints with baseline PDUS signal can substantially reduce the number of joints requiring follow-up scanning by 67.5% and improves feasibility. ""Flipped"" joints are infrequently seen after starting therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01717859 Key messages â¢ Only a small percent of joints develop power Doppler signal after baseline scanning. â¢ Changes in the SJS correlate well with changes in clinical activity measured by DAS28-ESR over time. â¢ The SJS effect size is higher than total PDUS and US7 scores, and may improve examination feasibility.","Kuo, Daniel; Morris, Nicolette T; Kaeley, Gurjit S; Ben-Artzi, Ami; Brook, Jenny; Elashoff, David A; Ranganath, Veena K",Clin. rheumatol,465,1

This modified gravity scenario introduces a fifth force between dark matter particles, mediated by a scalar field that plays the role of dark energy. The mass of the dark matter particles does not remain constant, but changes with time as a function of the scalar field. Here we focus on the phenomenological behavior of the model, and assess its ability to describe updated cosmological data sets that include the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature, polarization and lensing, baryon acoustic oscillations, the Pantheon compilation of supernovae of Type Ia, data on $H(z)$ from cosmic chronometers, and redshift-space distortions. We also study which is the impact of the local measurement of $H_0$ from SH0ES and the strong-lensing time delay data from the H0LICOW collaboration on the parameter that controls the strength of the interaction in the dark sector. We find a peak corresponding to a coupling $\beta>0$ and to a potential parameter $\alpha>0$, more or less evident depending on the data set combination. We show separately the impact of each data set and remark that it is especially CMB lensing the one data set that shifts the peak the most towards $\Lambda$CDM. When a model selection criterion based on the full Bayesian evidence is applied, however, $\Lambda$CDM is still preferred in all cases, due to the additional parameters introduced in the CDE model.","G'omez-Valent, Adria; Pettorino, Valeria; Amendola, Luca",,465,16

This allows us to model the human behavior and the impact of public health policies on the dynamics of the curve of active infected individuals during a COVID-19 epidemic outbreak. After proving the existence and global asymptotic stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points of the model with constant parameters, we consider a family of Cauchy problems, with piecewise constant parameters, and prove the existence of pseudo-oscillations between a neighborhood of the disease-free equilibrium and a neighborhood of the endemic equilibrium, in a biologically feasible region. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this pseudo-periodic solutions are related to the emergence of epidemic waves. Then, to capture the impact of mobility in the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemics, we propose a complex network with six distinct regions based on COVID-19 real data from Portugal. We perform numerical simulations for the complex network model, where the objective is to determine a topology that minimizes the level of active infected individuals and the existence of topologies that are likely to worsen the level of infection.

Older people and those with chronic noncommunicable diseases are more likely to develop serious illnesses, require ventilatory support, and die from complications. Objective: To establish deaths from respiratory infections and some chronic non-communicable diseases that occurred in Cali, before the SARS-CoV-2 disease pandemic. Methods: During the 2003-2019 period, 207,261 deaths were registered according to the general mortality database of the Municipal Secretary of Health of Cali. Deaths were coded with the International Classification of Diseases and causes of death were grouped according to WHO guidelines. Rates were standardized by age and are expressed per 100,000 people-year. Results: A direct relationship was observed between aging and mortality from respiratory infections and chronic non-communicable diseases. Age-specific mortality rates were highest in those older than 80 years for all diseases evaluated. Seasonal variation was evident in respiratory diseases in the elderly. Comments: Estimates of mortality rates from respiratory infections and chronic non-communicable diseases in Cali provide the baseline that will serve as a comparison to estimate the excess mortality caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Health authorities and decision makers should be guided by reliable estimates of mortality and of the proportion of infected people who die from SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.","Bravo, Luis Eduardo; Collazos, Paola; Grillo Ardila, Elvia Karina; García, Luz Stella; Millan, Erquinovaldo; Mera, Patricia; Holguín, Jorge",Colomb Med (Cali),465,8

The exact pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the role of each component of the innate and adaptive immune system is still unknown. However, available data from other coronavirus families, such as SARS-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome and also new findings could be useful for a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2. Toll-like receptors (TLR) play an important role in recognition of viral particles and activation of the innate immune system. Activation of TLR pathways leads to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, as well as type 1 interferon. Different TLRs, like TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are potentially important in COVID-19 infection. It is also worth mentioning that we should bear in mind both the beneficial and harmful effects of TLR in confronting COVID-19 infection. TLRs could be a potential target in controlling the infection in the early stages of disease and production of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.","Khanmohammadi, Shaghayegh; Rezaei, Nima",J. med. virol,465,26

This dramatically decreased case volumes for orthopaedic sports medicine fellows at academic institutions. Purpose: To describe how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the education of the sports medicine fellowship class of 2020 as well as the subsequent effects on their career plans and psychological well-being. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: A 33-item survey was distributed via email to all American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM) 2020 fellow members on April 22, 2020. Frequencies are presented as raw totals and percentages of respondents. The Fisher exact test was used to determine statistical significance between nominal variables, with significance set at P < .05. Results: Of 210 registered fellows, 101 (48.1%) responded. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, the typical case volume per week for most fellows (47.5%) was 11 to 15 cases. From the enactment of COVID-19 mitigation policies to the date of survey completion, 90.1% of fellows had performed fewer than 20 cases. A total of 32 fellows were presented with redeployment options by their fellowship program, with 10 redeployed mandatorily to other hospital departments. Fellows reported that web-based didactics (n = 100) and web-based journal clubs (n = 72) were utilized as alternative supplements in the absence of clinical education. There were 8 respondents who had either their prior contract or job offer rescinded, while 1 had a signed contract voided. As a result, 6 fellows now plan to matriculate into a previously unplanned fellowship. Also, 10 respondents' intended practice start date was being delayed by their employer. Respondents whose postfellowship plans were affected were statistically more likely to experience doubts about readiness for practice (58.8% vs 20.3%, respectively; P = .005), anxiety about future career plans (94.4% vs 63.8%, respectively; P = .01), anxiety about their financial situation (86.7% vs 50.8%, respectively; P = .018), stress in personal relationships (58.8% vs 29.9%, respectively; P = .045), and signs or symptoms of depression (41.2% vs 11.1%, respectively; P = .007) compared with those whose plans were not affected. Conclusion: This survey illustrates that during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent suspension of elective surgery, there have been downstream effects to this group's education, careers, board certification timeline, and potentially their social and/or emotional well-being.","Perrone, Michael A; Youssefzadeh, Keon; Serrano, Brian; Limpisvasti, Orr; Banffy, Michael",Orthop J Sports Med,465,16

Objective: To determine which and how many admissions to intensive care units are identified as having the lowest priority for ventilator allocation using 2 distinct sets of proposed triage criteria. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study conducted in spring 2020 used data collected from US hospitals and reported in the Philips eICU Collaborative Research Database. Adult admissions (N = 40â¯439) to 291 intensive care units from 2014 to 2015 who received mechanical ventilation and were not elective surgery patients were included. Exposures: New York State triage criteria and original triage criteria proposed by White and Lo. Main Outcomes and Measures: Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores were calculated for admissions. The proportion of patients who met initial criteria for the lowest level of priority for mechanical ventilation using each set of criteria and their characteristics and outcomes were assessed. Agreement was compared between the 2 sets of triage criteria, recognizing differences in stated criteria aims. Results: Among 40â¯439 intensive care unit admissions of patients who received mechanical ventilation, the mean (SD) age was 62.6 (16.6) years, 54.9% were male, and the mean (SD) SOFA score was 4.5 (3.7). Using the New York State triage criteria, 8.9% (95% CI, 8.7%-9.2%) were in the lowest priority category; these lowest priority admissions had a mean (SD) age of 62.9 (16.6) years, used a median (interquartile range) of 57.3 (20.1-133.5) ventilator hours each, and had a hospital survival rate of 38.6% (95% CI, 37.0%-40.2%). Using the White and Lo triage criteria, 4.3% (95% CI, 4.1%-4.5%) were in the lowest priority category; these admissions had a mean (SD) age of 68.6 (13.2) years, used a median (interquartile range) of 61.7 (24.3-142.8) ventilator hours each, and had a hospital survival rate of 56.2% (95% CI, 53.8%-58.7%). Only 655 admissions (1.6%) were in the lowest priority category for both guidelines, with the &#954; statistic for agreement equal to 0.20 (95% CI, 0.18-0.21). Conclusions and Relevance: Use of 2 initially proposed ventilator triage guidelines identified approximately 1 in every 10 to 25 admissions as having the lowest priority for ventilator allocation, with little agreement. Clinical assessment of different potential criteria for triage decisions in critically ill populations is important to ensure valid and equitable allocation of resources.","Wunsch, Hannah; Hill, Andrea D; Bosch, Nicholas; Adhikari, Neill K J; Rubenfeld, Gordon; Walkey, Allan; Ferreyro, Bruno L; Tillmann, Bourke W; Amaral, Andre C K B; Scales, Damon C; Fan, Eddy; Cuthbertson, Brian H; Fowler, Robert A",JAMA Netw Open,465,1

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was a survey-based e-learning research among dental students in the clinical study phase of a department of prosthetic dentistry at a German university hospital. A total of 44 questions were answered in four main sections: 1. general technical components; 2. acceptance; 3. evaluation and functionality; and 4. overall evaluation and grades of the various digital concepts. The use of Zoom conference, livestream, and prerecorded PowerPoint was compared to the conventional lecture setup (control group/CG). Data were analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, followed by an exploratory data analysis and Cronbach's alpha test (&#945; = 0.05). RESULTS: Students were very satisfied with the provision, quality, and benefit of the digital concepts. The asynchronous concept was significantly more satisfying than the synchronous concepts in many aspects but was less successful in interactions. In the overall evaluation and grading, the asynchronous concept was rated significantly better than the other synchronous concepts (p &#8804; 0.007), followed by Zoom conference, conventional lecture (CG), and livestream, while Zoom conference and the conventional lecture showed no significant difference (p = 0.784). CONCLUSIONS: Students significantly preferred the asynchronous concept to the synchronous concepts.

Alternative sampling procedures that are less invasive and do not require a health care professional, such as saliva collection, would be more preferable. We compared saliva specimens and nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs with respect to sensitivity in detecting SARS-CoV-2. We obtained a nasopharyngeal and two saliva specimens (collected by spitting or oral swabbing) from >2500 individuals. All samples were tested by RT-qPCR, detecting RNA of SARS-CoV-2. We compared the test sensitivity on the two saliva collections with the nasopharyngeal specimen for all subjects and stratified by symptom status and viral load. Of the 2850 patients for whom all three samples were available, 105 were positive on NP swab, whereas 32 and 23 were also positive on saliva spitting and saliva swabbing samples, respectively. The sensitivity of the RT-qPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 among NP-positive patients was 30.5% (95% CI, 1.9%-40.2%) for saliva spitting and 21.9% (95% CI, 14.4%-31.0%) for saliva swabbing. However, when focusing on subjects with medium to high viral load, sensitivity on saliva increased substantially: 93.9% (95% CI, 79.8%-99.3%) and 76.9% (95% CI, 56.4%-91.0%) for spitting and swabbing, respectively, regardless of symptomatic status.

The duration of quarantine impacts the psychological status of the general population. However, until now no study has explored the psychological impact of the pandemic and quarantine together with longitudinal changes in the mental health status of Italian elderly. METHODS: An online questionnaire including an assessment of depression, anxiety, anger, post-traumatic stress, subjective cognitive failures, resilience, coping style, and other dimensions related to the pandemic was completed by participants during (T0) and two months after the end (T1) of the quarantine. RESULTS: The sample recruited at T0 included 334 elderly participants. About 45% of the participants experienced depression, anxiety, or anger. Moreover, more fear of getting infected was related to more severe depression, anxiety, and anger, but resilience was found to mediate these relationships. More severe depressive and anger symptoms were related to more severe cognitive failures. No significant difference was observed in mental health scores between T0 and T1. Finally, more severe depression at T0 was associated with the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms at T1. CONCLUSIONS: The fear of getting infected, probably due to perceived vulnerability to disease, seems to play a crucial role in the development of psychological symptoms in the elderly, but resilience seems to mediate the impact of fear. The presence of long-term psychological consequences and the possible risk of developing PTS symptoms in the elderly suggest the need for targeted interventions to reduce possible long-term psychological and cognitive consequences.","Maggi, Gianpaolo; Baldassarre, Ivana; Barbaro, Andrea; Cavallo, Nicola Davide; Cropano, Maria; Nappo, Raffaele; Santangelo, Gabriella",Psychogeriatrics,465,24

There is an urgent need for therapeutics, both through the repurposing of approved drugs and the development of new treatments. In addition to the viral drug targets, a number of human drug targets have been suggested. In theory, targeting human proteins should provide an advantage over targeting viral proteins in terms of drug resistance, which is commonly a problem in treating RNA viruses. This paper focuses on the human protein TMPRSS2, which supports coronavirus life cycles by cleaving viral spike proteins. The three-dimensional structure of TMPRSS2 is not known and so we have generated models of the TMPRSS2 in the apo state as well as in complex with a peptide substrate and putative inhibitors to aid future work. Importantly, many related human proteases have 80% or higher identity with TMPRSS2 in the S1-S1' subsites, with plasminogen and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) having 95% identity. We highlight 376 approved, investigational or experimental drugs targeting S1A serine proteases that may also inhibit TMPRSS2. Whilst the presence of a relatively uncommon lysine residue in the S2/S3 subsites means that some serine protease inhibitors will not inhibit TMPRSS2, this residue is likely to provide a handle for selective targeting in a focused drug discovery project. We discuss how experimental drugs targeting related serine proteases might be repurposed as TMPRSS2 inhibitors to treat coronaviruses.","Huggins, David J",J Mol Graph Model,465,14

METHODS: The patients with nAMD having IVI appointments between March 16 and June 1, 2020 (RP in Turkey) were included in this retrospective study. For adherence analysis, the patients who attended (Group 1, n = 44) and who did not attend (Group 2, n = 60) their IVI appointment visits during the RP (VRP) were evaluated according to their last visit before the RP (V0). For outcome analysis, the patients who attend VRP and have follow-up (Group 1a, 46 eyes) and who did not attend VRP but later attended for follow-up (Group 2a, 33 eyes) were evaluated for functional (best-corrected visual acuity, BCVA [logMAR]) and anatomical (optical coherence tomography [OCT] disease activity) outcomes at the first visit after RP (V1) and last visit within six months after RP (V2). Patients received a complete ophthalmologic evaluation with anti-VEGF (Aflibercept) IVI administration at all visits. RESULTS: The adherence rate of the patients to VRP was 42.3% (44/104). The patients in Group 1 were significantly younger (mean ± SD years, 71.0 ± 8.1 vs. 74.7 ± 8.0, p = 0.024), had better median [IQR] BCVA at their first presentation (0.30 [0.54] vs. 0.61 [1.08], p = 0.023) and V0 (0.40 [0.48] vs. 0.52 [0.70], p = 0.031), and had less hypertension (36.4% vs. 58.3%, p = 0.044) than Group 2. The mean ± SD delay of planned IVI at VRP in Group 2a was 13.9 ± 6.2 weeks. Disease activity in OCT was significantly higher in Group 2a than Group 1a at V1 (60.6% vs. 32.6%, p = 0.025). In Group 2a, the median (IQR) BCVA was significantly worse at V1 (0.70 [0.58]) and V2 (0.70 [0.59]) than V0 (0.52 [0.40], p = 0.047 and p = 0.035, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the scheduled nAMD patients in TAE protocol missed their IVI visits during the RP, which resulted in a delay of their treatments. The delay of IVI treatment in those patients resulted in an increase in OCT disease activity and a decrease in BCVA.","Sevik, Mehmet Orkun; Aykut, Aslan; Özkan, Gamze; Dericioglu, Volkan; Sahin, Özlem",Int. ophthalmol,465,26

Proliferation of CAR T-cells after infusion and their persistence have been reported as important factors. Laboratory tools are needed for the monitoring of patients. We developed a vector-based, simple and accurate real-time qPCR to measure axi-cel vector copy number (VCN) in peripheral blood samples. Primers and probe targeting the 5'LTR region of the gammaretroviral vector (mouse stem cell virus or MSCV) were designed for amplification. To generate standard curves MSCV plasmid was subcultured and quantified using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The method was applied to quantify VCN in blood samples from patients treated with axi-cel. The limit of quantification of the qPCR assay was established at 2.2 copies/µL in DNA eluate. The qPCR method was well correlated with flow cytometry (FC) findings; however, the assay appeared to be more sensitive than FC. The kinetics observed in blood samples from treated patients was in agreement with previously reported findings. In conclusion, we developed a sensitive and accurate qPCR assay for the quantification of transgenic CAR T-cells, which can be a useful additional tool for the monitoring of patients treated with of axi-cel.","Baras, Agathe; Bocket, Laurence; Beauvais, David; Hallaert, Christophe; Varlet, Pauline; Agha, Ibrahim Yakoub; Hober, Didier; Alidjinou, Enagnon Kazali",J. mol. diagn,465,1

We developed this model when the COVID-19 epidemic was at its early phase. We reasoned that, with our model, the effects of different measures could be assessed for infection control. Unlike the homogeneous models, our model accounts for human population heterogeneity, where subpopulations (e.g., age groups) have different infection risks. The heterogeneous model estimates several characteristics of the epidemic more accurately compared to the homogeneous models. According to our analysis, the total number of infections and their peak number are lower compared to the assessment with the homogeneous models. Furthermore, the early-stage infection increase is little changed when population heterogeneity is considered, whereas the late-stage infection decrease slows. The model predicts that the anti-epidemic measures, like the ones undertaken in China and the rest of the world, decrease the basic reproductive number but do not result in the development of a sufficient collective immunity, which poses a risk of a second wave. More recent developments confirmed our conclusion that the epidemic has a high likelihood to restart after the quarantine measures are lifted.","Gerasimov, Andrey; Lebedev, Georgy; Lebedev, Mikhail; Semenycheva, Irina",Front Public Health,465,20

Improved cleaning can reduce the incidence of infection and is cost effective but relies on healthcare personnel to correctly apply cleaning measures. As nurses and midwives have the most contact with patients and as an important first step in improving compliance, this study sought to explore nurses' and midwives' knowledge on the role of the environment in infection prevention and control and identify challenges in maintaining clean patient environments. METHODS: Cross-sectional online survey of 96 nurses (RN/EN) and midwives (RW) employed in clinical settings (e.g. hospital, aged care, medical centre, clinic) in Australia. RESULTS: Nurses and midwives broadly stated that they understood the importance of cleaning. However, cleaning responsibilities varied and there was confusion regarding the application of different disinfectants when cleaning after patients with a suspected or diagnosed infection post-discharge. Most would not be confident being placed in a room where a previous patient had a diagnosed infection such as multi-drug resistant organism. CONCLUSION: Greater organisational support and improving applied knowledge about infection control procedures is needed. This includes correct use of disinfectants, which disinfectant to use for various situations, and cleaning effectively following discharge of a patient with known infection. The cleanliness of shared medical equipment may also pose current risk due to lack of cleaning.","Mitchell, Brett G; Russo, Philip L; Kiernan, Martin; Curryer, Cassie",Infect. Dis. Health,465,14

OBJECTIVE: This study used data collected from the online survey study on COVID-19 in Taiwan to examine what major COVID-19 information sources are available and which sources are significantly related to the self-confidence of people in coping with COVID-19 in Taiwan. METHODS: A total of 1904 participants (1270 non-health-care workers and 634 health care workers) were recruited from the Facebook advertisement. Their major sources of information about COVID-19, the relationships between the sources and demographic factors, and the relationships between the sources and the self-confidence in coping with COVID-19 were surveyed. RESULTS: Most Taiwanese people relied on the internet for COVID-19 information. Many respondents also used a variety of sources of information on COVID-19; such variety was associated with sex, age, and the level of worry toward COVID-19, as well as if one was a health care worker. For health care workers, the use of formal lessons as an information source was significantly associated with better self-confidence in coping with COVID-19. The significant association between receiving information from more sources and greater self-confidence was found only in health care workers but not in non-health-care workers.

METHODS: A survey was administered in a Singapore ED (June 2016-June 2017). A convenience sample of parents/carers accompanying pediatric patients completed a self-administered questionnaire. The primary outcome measures were prevalence of CAM use and perceptions of CAM. RESULTS: Parents/carers of 610 patients participated. Four hundred seventy-five (78.0%, 95% confidence interval, 74.5-81.0) had taken a CAM within the previous 12 months and 110 (18.1%; 95% confidence interval, 14.8-21.0) had taken a CAM on the day of presentation. There were no sex differences between CAM users and nonusers (P = 0.691). The use of CAM was more common among preschool children and younger (62.9%). There was no difference in CAM use among those with and without chronic disease (P = 0.878). Vitamins/supplements, cod liver oil, and probiotics were the most commonly used CAM. A total of 0.7% of CAM use was reported to the ED doctor. There were no adverse effects reported. The perception that CAMs are safe was more common among parents or caregivers who had administered CAM (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Complementary and alternative medicine use is very common among pediatric ED patients in Singapore and is more prevalent than in Australia and the United Kingdom. However, it is not always reported to the doctor. Parents or caregivers who administer CAM are more likely to perceive CAMs to be safe.","Sathiyan, Jayapriya; Faeyza, Noorul; Ramasamy, Krishnapriya; Ng, Wei Sheng; Ganapathy, Sashikumar",Pediatr. emerg. care,465,1

Nine days later in Brazil, community transmission was deemed ongoing, and following what was already being put in place in various affected countries, restrictive and physical distancing measures that varied in severity across the different states were adopted. Adherence to restrictive and physical distancing measures depends on the general acceptance of public health measures as well as communities' financial leverage. This article aims to explore and discuss ethical facilitators and barriers to the implementation of physical distancing measures within three dimensions: political, socio-economic, and scientific. Furthermore, we would like to discuss ways to ethically promote restrictive and physical distancing measures in a large and unequal country like Brazil.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of Brazilian civil servants participating in the fourth wave (2012-2013) of the longitudinal Pró-Saúde Study. Associations were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI), estimated by multivariate logistic regression models. Results: Among 2,828 participants, 15.9% would not be willing to vaccinate in the future if the Brazilian Ministry of Health promoted a new vaccination campaign against pandemic influenza. Not willing to vaccinate in the future was strongly associated with not taking the pandemic influenza vaccine in 2010 (OR = 9.0, 95%CI 6.9 - 11.6). Among the unvaccinated, females, those aged &gt; 60 years, and non-health care workers were less willing to vaccinate in the future. Again, in the vaccinated group, females were less willing to vaccinate. Conclusion: Multidisciplinary efforts should be encouraged in order to identify reasons for refusing vaccination, focusing on the individual and group perceptions of susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers to vaccination. Such information is needed to identify target groups for the delivery of customized interventions towards preventing emerging pandemics, such as avian influenza and COVID-19.","Werneck, Guilherme Loureiro; Faerstein, Eduardo",Rev. bras. epidemiol,465,21

The aim of this study was to analyze the genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2 in Jordan, with a special focus on the UK variant of concern. A total of 579 SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected in Jordan were subjected to maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. Genetic lineage assignment was undertaken using the Pango system. Amino acid substitutions were investigated using the Protein Variation Effect Analyzer (PROVEAN) tool. A total of 19 different SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages were detected, with the most frequent being the first Jordan lineage (B.1.1.312), first detected in August 2020 (n = 424, 73.2%). This was followed by the second Jordan lineage (B.1.36.10), first detected in September 2020 (n = 62, 10.7%), and the UK variant of concern (B.1.1.7; n = 36, 6.2%). In the spike gene region, the molecular signature for B.1.1.312 was the non-synonymous mutation A24432T resulting in a deleterious amino acid substitution (Q957L), while the molecular signature for B.1.36.10 was the synonymous mutation C22444T. Bayesian analysis revealed that the UK variant of concern (B.1.1.7) was introduced into Jordan in late November 2020 (mean estimate); four weeks earlier than its official reporting in the country. In Jordan, an exponential increase in COVID-19 cases due to B.1.1.7 lineage coincided with the new year 2021. The highest proportion of phylogenetic clustering was detected for the B.1.1.7 lineage. The amino acid substitution D614G in the spike glycoprotein was exclusively present in the country from July 2020 onwards. Two Jordanian lineages dominated infections in the country, with continuous introduction/emergence of new lineages. In Jordan, the rapid spread of the UK variant of concern should be monitored closely. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 mutants appeared to be related to the founder effect; nevertheless, the biological impact of certain mutations should be further investigated.","Sallam, Malik; Mahafzah, Azmi",,465,15

Methods: We collected epidemiological and clinical information of patients with COVID-19 admitted to a makeshift Fangcang hospital between 7 and 26 February, 2020. The waiting time of each step during the medical care-seeking process was also analysed. Results: Of the 205 patients with COVID-19 infection, 31% had presumed transmission from a family member. 10% of patients had hospital-related transmission. It took as long as a median of 6 days from the first medical visit to receive the COVID-19 nucleic acid test and 10 days from the first medical visit to hospital admission, indicating early recognition of COVID-19 was not achieved at the early stage of the outbreak, although these delays were shortened later. After clinical recovery from COVID-19, which took a mean of 21 days from illness onset, there was still a substantial proportion of patients who had persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions: The diagnostic evaluation process of suspected patients needs to be accelerated at the epicentre of the outbreak and early isolation of infected patients in a healthcare setting rather than at home is urgently required to stop the spread of the virus. Clinical recovery is not an appropriate criterion to release isolated patients and as long as 4 weeks’ isolation for patients with COVID-19 is not enough to prevent the spread of the virus.","Hua, Jing; Chen, Rongzhang; Zhao, Liming; Wu, Xiaodong; Guo, Qian; He, Chunfeng; Li, Tian; Ren, Xiaoyu; Liu, Zhongmin; Li, Qiang; Wang, Feilong",ERJ Open Res.,465,6

Age-old passive immunization with protective antibodies to neutralize the virus is one of the strategies for emergency prophylaxis and therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, the authors discuss up-to-date advances in immune-based therapy for COVID-19. The use of convalescent plasma therapy as the first line of defense to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been established, with encouraging results. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or block the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor have been found to be very promising as a countermeasure for tackling the SARS-CoV-2 infection, and clinical trials are underway. Considering the counterproductive antibody-dependent enhancement of the virus, mAbs therapy that is safe and efficacious, even in people with underlying conditions, will be a significant breakthrough. In addition, emerging immunotherapeutic interventions using nanobodies and cellular immunotherapy are promising avenues for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors also discuss the implication of mAbs as mediators of cytokine storm syndrome to modify the immune response of COVID-19 patients, thus reducing the fatality rate of COVID-19 infection.","Sajna, Kuttuvan Valappil; Kamat, Siya",Cytotherapy,465,26

Online teaching has suddenly become the main form of medical education, a form that may be used as long as the pandemic continues. We aimed at analyzing how online teaching was perceived by both teachers and learners to help determine how to adapt curricula in the next few years. An anonymous cross-sectional survey of medical students, pediatric residents, neonatal fellows, and their respective teachers was conducted between June and August 2020 to assess feelings about quality, attendance, equivalence, and sustainability of online teaching programs. 146 Students and 26 teachers completed the survey. 89% of students agreed that the offered online teaching was an appropriate way of teaching during the pandemic. Less than half of learners and teachers felt they have received or provided a training of an equivalent level and quality as in usual courses. About one-third thought that this online teaching should continue after the crisis ends. Medical school students had significantly more mixed opinions on online teaching than residents and fellows did. Attendance of learners significantly improved with synchronous online classes (p < 0.001), and among more advanced learners (p < 0.002). Our study is the first of this kind to assess simultaneously the feelings of learners at different levels (medical students, residents, and fellows) and their respective teachers of pediatric on programs taught online. It showed that online programs were perceived as appropriate ways of teaching during the COVID pandemic.

Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was administered among DHCWs in Saudi Arabia using convenience sampling. A questionnaire collected data on demographic characteristics and the 43 items from the TPB construct. One-way ANOVA and Independent sample t-tests were used to establish factors associated with TPB-construct scores. Multiple regression analyses with adjusted effects were used to identify significant predictors for intention from attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control variables.

The constructs of attitude toward behavior (p<0.001) and subjective norms (p<0.001) significantly predicted the DHCWs' intention to practice COVID-19 IPC behavior, accounting for 44.3% of the variance. Conclusion: The current study suggests that the attitudes and subjective norms of DHCWs significantly predicted their intentions regarding COVID-19 IPC behavior. As such, it is recommended that comprehensive education and training programs on infection control pertaining to COVID-19 be implemented among DHCWs in Saudi Arabia so that their attitudes and behavior toward infection prevention are amplified.","Shubayr, Mosa A; Mashyakhy, Mohammed; Al Agili, Dania E; Albar, Nassreen; Quadri, Mir Faeq",J Multidiscip Healthc,465,22

In July 2020, 'remote-first' became long-term government policy. AIM: To explore how this change was portrayed in national newspapers and how depictions changed over time. DESIGN AND SETTING: Thematic analysis of newspaper articles referring to remote GP consultations from two time periods: 2 March-31 May 2020 (period 1) and 30 July-12 August 2020 (period 2). METHOD: Articles were identified through, and extracted from, LexisNexis Academic UK. A coding system of themes and narrative devices was developed and applied to the data. The analysis was developed iteratively, amending the coding structure as new data were added. RESULTS: Remote consulting was widely covered in newspapers. Articles in period 1 depicted it positively, equating digital change with progress and linking novel technological solutions with improved efficiency and safety (for example, infection control) in a service that was overdue for modernisation. Articles in period 2 questioned the persistence of a remote-first service now that the pandemic was waning, emphasising, for example, missed diagnoses, challenges to the therapeutic relationship, and digital inequalities. CONCLUSION: As the first wave of the pandemic came and went, media depictions of remote consulting evolved from an 'efficiency and safety' narrative to a 'risks, inequalities, and lack of choice' narrative. To restore public trust in general practice, public communication should emphasise the wide menu of consulting options now available to patients and measures being taken to assure safety and avoid inequity.","Mroz, Gilly; Papoutsi, Chrysanthi; Rushforth, Alex; Greenhalgh, Trisha",Br J Gen Pract,465,1

Moreover, the number of deaths is going to increase over the next few months until the pandemic comes to an end, and a second wave has also been reported in few countries. Most interestingly, the death rate among certain populations from the same COVID-19 infection is highly variable. For instance, the European populations show a very high death rate, in contrast to the populations from Chinese ethnicities. Amongst all the closed cases with an outcome (total recovered + total died), the death rate in Italy is 13%, Iran is 6%, China is 5%, Brazil is 3%, The United States of America is 2%, India 2%, Israel is 1% as of October 08, 2020. However, the percentage was higher during the early phase of the pandemic. Moreover, the global death rate amongst all the patients with an outcome is 4%. Here we have reviewed virus-transmitted various respiratory tract infections and postulated a better understanding of SARS-CoV2 using lung stem cell organoids in vitro. Hence, here we propose the strategies of understanding first the infectivity/severity ratio of COVID-19 infections using various ethnicity originated induced pluripotent stem cell-derived lung stem cell organoids in vitro. The greater the infectivity to severity ratio, the better the disease outcome with the value of 1 being the worst disease outcome. This strategy will be useful for understanding the infectivity/severity ratio of virus induced respiratory tract infections for a possible betterment of community-based disease management. Also, such a strategy will be useful for screening the effect of various antiviral drugs/repurposed drugs for their efficacy in vitro.","Bose, Bipasha; Kapoor, Saketh; Nihad, Muhammad",Adv. exp. med. biol,465,23

However, the relationship between abdominal obesity and CXR severity score has not yet been fully explored. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed the association of different adiposity indexes, including waist circumference and body mass index (BMI), with CXR severity score in 215 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Patients with abdominal obesity showed significantly higher CXR severity scores and had higher rates of CXR severity scores &#8805; 8 compared to those without abdominal obesity (P < 0.001; P = 0.001, respectively). By contrast, patients with normal weight, with overweight and those with BMI-based obesity showed no significant differences in either CXR severity scores or in the rates of CXR severity scores &#8805; 8 (P = 0.104; P = 0.271, respectively). Waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) correlated more closely with CXR severity scores than BMI (r = 0.43, P < 0.001; r = 0.41, P < 0.001; r = 0.17, P = 0.012, respectively). The area under the curves (AUCs) for waist circumference and WHtR were significantly higher than that for BMI in identifying a high CXR severity score (&#8805; 8) (0.68 [0.60-0.75] and 0.67 [0.60-0.74] vs 0.58 [0.51-0.66], P = 0.001). A multivariate analysis indicated abdominal obesity (risk ratio: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.25-2.45, P < 0.001), bronchial asthma (risk ratio: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.07-2.81, P = 0.026) and oxygen saturation at admission (risk ratio: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.94-0.97, P < 0.001) as the only independent factors associated with high CXR severity scores. CONCLUSION: Abdominal obesity phenotype is associated with a high CXR severity score better than BMI-based obesity in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Therefore, when visiting the patient in a hospital setting, waist circumference should be measured, and patients with abdominal obesity should be monitored closely.

Thus, we aimed to explore TCM characteristics of clinical efficacy to NCP, as well as to optimize Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPDD) and the recommended formulas to NCP by National Health Commission (NHC). Methods: Chinese medical sciences theory and clinical application of TCM were analyzed. A total of 54 NCP patients were observed in a hospital from Wuhan, whose clinical characteristics and utilization of Chinese Medicines (CMs) were described. Paired t test was used to measure the change of patients' hemogram during hospitalization period, indicating the effect of CMs. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to explore the factors affecting the length of hospital stay. Network pharmacology analysis was applied to figure out the performance of NHC-recommended formulas of five disease stages at levels of compounds, targets and pathways. Result: The average length of hospital stay was 8.96 days. Patients over 45 stayed 9.79 days in hospital in average, longer than 7.64 days of patients under 45. Comparing the hemograms between admission and discharge of hospital, the number of leukocytes, neutrophil, lymphocyte and platelet increased, while the numbers of erythrocytes, hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit decreased. According to the standard coefficients of regression, the factor affecting the length of stay for the most was CMs in category of invigorating spleen and removing dampness (ISRD), followed by administrating CMs, male, and cough. Thirty-two CMs were screened after deleting duplication from QFPDD and NHC-recommended formulas. Compound quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, acacetin etc., were all involved in the treatment of various disease stages on the compound level both in generality and individuality. Conclusion: TCM has a systemic theoretical understanding on the pathological evolution and a positive clinical efficacy on NCP. The CMs of ISRD improved patients' recovery, suggesting the importance of regulating intestinal function and keeping microenvironmental balance in TCM treatment of NCP. The active compounds from QFPDD and NHC-recommended formulas contribute to recovery of varied disease progresses during TCM treating NCP.","Luo, Erdan; Zhang, Daiyan; Luo, Hua; Liu, Bowen; Zhao, Keming; Zhao, Yonghua; Bian, Ying; Wang, Yitao",Chin.

Our goal is to explore how SARS-CoV-2 could interfere with various host cell functions, and to identify drug targets amongst the host genes that could potentially be modulated against COVID-19 by repurposing existing drugs. The machine learning model employed here involves gene embeddings that leverage causal gene expression signatures curated from literature. In contrast to other network-based approaches for drug repurposing, our approach explicitly takes the direction of effects into account, distinguishing between activation and inhibition. RESULTS: We have constructed 70 networks connecting SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins to various biological functions, diseases, and pathways reflecting viral biology, clinical observations, and co-morbidities in the context of COVID-19. Results are presented in the form of interactive network visualizations through a web interface, the Coronavirus Network Explorer (CNE), that allows exploration of underlying experimental evidence. We find that existing drugs targeting genes in those networks are strongly enriched in the set of drugs that are already in clinical trials against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The approach presented here can identify biologically plausible hypotheses for COVID-19 pathogenesis, explicitly connected to the immunological, virological and pathological observations seen in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The discovery of repurposable drugs is driven by prior knowledge of relevant functional endpoints that reflect known viral biology or clinical observations, therefore suggesting potential mechanisms of action. We believe that the CNE offers relevant insights that go beyond more conventional network approaches, and can be a valuable tool for drug repurposing.

Numerous machine learning algorithms have been developed to identify different diseases, e.g., leukemia. Leukemia is a white blood cells- (WBC-) related illness affecting the bone marrow and/or blood. A quick, safe, and accurate early-stage diagnosis of leukemia plays a key role in curing and saving patients' lives. Based on developments, leukemia consists of two primary forms, i.e., acute and chronic leukemia. Each form can be subcategorized as myeloid and lymphoid. There are, therefore, four leukemia subtypes. Various approaches have been developed to identify leukemia with respect to its subtypes. However, in terms of effectiveness, learning process, and performance, these methods require improvements. This study provides an Internet of Medical Things- (IoMT-) based framework to enhance and provide a quick and safe identification of leukemia. In the proposed IoMT system, with the help of cloud computing, clinical gadgets are linked to network resources. The system allows real-time coordination for testing, diagnosis, and treatment of leukemia among patients and healthcare professionals, which may save both time and efforts of patients and clinicians. Moreover, the presented framework is also helpful for resolving the problems of patients with critical condition in pandemics such as COVID-19. The methods used for the identification of leukemia subtypes in the suggested framework are Dense Convolutional Neural Network (DenseNet-121) and Residual Convolutional Neural Network (ResNet-34). Two publicly available datasets for leukemia, i.e., ALL-IDB and ASH image bank, are used in this study. The results demonstrated that the suggested models supersede the other well-known machine learning algorithms used for healthy-versus-leukemia-subtypes identification.","Bibi, Nighat; Sikandar, Misba; Ud Din, Ikram; Almogren, Ahmad; Ali, Sikandar",J Healthc Eng,465,16

METHODS: A systematic research was performed on the major international online databases; Thirty-five articles were selected. RESULTS: A statistically significant reduction in testosterone levels and sperm quality in subjects with COVID-19 has been highlighted in several papers; however, in many cases the tests have been conducted in patients with active disease and long-term consequences are still not known. Some studies have confirmed the presence of the virus in the testis in a low percentage of patients; viral presence in sperm has only been found in one study. Testicular discomfort, which could indicate viral orchitis, was highlighted in several works, with an incidence of up to 19% percent of patients. The presence of inflammatory lymphocytic infiltrates, IgG and inflammatory cytokines have been documented in several works; pathological signs of inflammation were found in 60.9% of testicular biopsies performed in one study. The entry of the virus into the testis cells, both stromal and seminal cells appeared to be Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) mediated, as it also occurs in other tissues. DNA fragmentation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, autoantibody production and ACE2 mediated effect have all been hypothesized as cause of cellular damage. CONCLUSIONS: The results on effects of COVID-19 infection on the male reproductive system are currently insufficient as they are based on a small number of patients and therefore are often contradictory.Certain mechanisms of testicular damage are still to be assessed, as any risk categories like age, ethnicity, or others. As for the transmission of the virus through sperm, there is insufficient evidence to ensure that this cannot happen.","Delle Fave, Rocco Francesco; Polisini, Giordano; Giglioni, Gianluca; Parlavecchio, Arnaldo; Dell039,; Atti, Lucio; Galosi, Andrea Benedetto",Arch Ital Urol Androl,465,16

IB is one of the most highly contagious diseases, which results in many economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. The nature of this virus is such that it generates new genotypes continuously. Proper vaccination is the most suitable way of combatting IB. One of the novel genotypes of IBV, which has been circulating in the Middle Eastern countries, is the variant 2 (IS-1494/GI-23) genotype. This study aims to design and produce an autogenous variant 2 vaccines. After isolation and characterization of the Iranian variant 2, the inactivated vaccine was formulated according to the OIE guidelines, and its different aspects (Purity, titration, inactivation, immunization) were evaluated. The designed vaccine passed all of OIE quality control standards. In the assessment process, the protection rate in the groups receiving the variant 2 and commercial vaccines was 67 % and 60 %, respectively. Although the differences were not significant, they indicated better protection, and the viral load in the feces and the kidney of the group receiving the variant 2 vaccine was lower than that in the commercial vaccine. It is suggested that the variant2 strain should be added as one of the local strains to the commercial inactivated vaccines in areas affected by this genotype. The use of this vaccine in layer and breeder flocks can help to protect them against variant 2 during the production phase. Also, the transfer of maternal antibodies to offspring can provide strain-specific immunity for one-day-old chickens.","Erfanmanesh, Ahmad; Ghalyanchilangeroudi, Arash; Nikaein, Donya; Hosseini, Hossein; Mohajerfar, Tahereh",Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,465,16

However, the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on physical activity and glycemic control in such individuals is not known. We studied the physical activity and glycemic control during lockdown in comparison to pre-lockdown parameters in individuals with long-standing type 2 diabetes. Methods: This prospective, observational study includes 2240 people with T2DM regularly attending diabetes clinic prior to lockdown. Glycemic record, HbA1c, and physical activity assessed with Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) as metabolic equivalents (MetS min/week) were obtained during lockdown (minimum duration of 3 months). Results: A total of 422 out of 750 participants (nest) responded. The median (IQR) for age was 58 (52 to 64) years, duration of diabetes 11 (6 to 16) years, prevalent foot complications in 59.7%, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in 21.3% of participants.

COVID-19 has also disproportionately affected older adults. In the context of COVID-19, decision-making surrounding place of care and place of death in older adults involves significant new challenges. AIMS: To explore key factors that influence place of care and place of death decisions in older adults. A secondary aim was to investigate key factors that influence the process and outcome of these decisions in older adults. To apply findings from current evidence to the context of COVID-19. METHODS: Rapid review of reviews, undertaken using WHO guidance for rapid reviews for the production of actionable evidence. Data extracted was synthesised using narrative synthesis, with thematic analysis and tabulation. RESULTS: Ten papers were included for full data extraction. These papers were published between 2005-2020. Papers included discussed actual place of death, as well as preferred. Results were divided into papers that explored the process of decision-making, and those that explored decision-making outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The process and outcomes of decision-making for older people are affected by many factors-all of which have the potential to influence both patients and caregivers experience of illness and dying.

Its successes lead to applications of modeling methods not only to HIV but a plethora of other viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), which along with HIV cause chronic diseases, and viruses such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), West Nile virus (WNV), Zika virus, and SARS-CoV-2, which generally cause acute infections. Here we first review the historical development of mathematical models to understand HIV and HCV infections and the effects of treatment by fitting the models to clinical data. We then focus on recent efforts and contributions of applying these models towards understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight outstanding questions where modeling can provide crucial insights and help to optimize non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The review is written from our personal perspective emphasizing the power of simple target cell limited models that provided important insights and then their evolution into more complex models that captured more of the virology and immunology.

The Older Adult Mental Health Wards in Bridgend were relocated from the district general hospital (Princess of Wales) and merged at Angelton Clinic, an off site separate unit. It was therefore essential that patients had clear escalation of care plans as access to medical input was limited and transfer to hospital potentially not appropriate in the later stages of chronic illness such as dementia.The initial aim of the PDSA cycle was to assess the level of compliance with Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) discussions and if appropriate, DNAR documentation. The other aim was to assess the utilisation of Escalation of Care plans.MethodAn audit of patients MDT medical notes on 38 admitted to Angelton clinic was carrired out in March. It was documented if the patient had a clear DNAR or Escalation plan that was easily accessible in the front of the notes. The guidelines compared to were the GMC recommendations that patients 12 months of should have a discussion about risks and benefits associated with Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. If the patient lacks capacity a best interest decision should be made with nearest relatives. Discussions should also be had with patients and family in in regards to and transfer to a medical ward.Upon completion of the initial PDSA cycle, views were sought from the wider MDT a new escalation of care proforma was designed. This was implemented by education and communication with members of the medical team. This was to be clearly placed in the notes, with the DNAR form if that was appropriate.ResultAll inpatient notes were audited at Angelton Clinic in March 2020. It was found that only 18% of patients had Escalation of Care plans in comparison to 84% of notes which had DNAR forms. Previous escalation of care forms were not being utilised appropriately.Upon implementation of the Escalation of Care proforma, a re-audit of the audit cyle was completed. In July 2020 it was found that 78% of notes had completed Escalation of Care forms with 83% had completed DNAR forms.ConclusionTo enable ongoing sustained improvement, the unit Nurse Practitioner will champion its completion. The audit findings have been shared with the newly rotated junior doctors and proformas were made available on all inpatient wards.","McDermott, Alexander Rankin Jennifer",BJPsych Open,465,11

Characteristics and clinical significance of myocardial injury remain unclear. METHODS: This retrospective single-center study analyzed 189 patients who received a COVID-19 diagnosis out of all 758 subjects with a high sensitive troponin I (Hs-TnI) measurement within the first 24 h of admission at the Policlinico A.Gemelli (Rome, Italy) between February 20th 2020 to April 09th 2020. RESULTS: The prevalence of myocardial injury in our COVID-19 population is of 16%. The patients with cardiac injury were older, had a greater number of cardiovascular comorbidities and higher values of acute phase and inflammatory markers and leucocytes. They required more frequently hospitalization in Intensive Care Unit (10 [32.3%] vs 18 [11.4%]; p = .003) and the mortality rate was significantly higher (17 [54.8%] vs. 15 [9.5%], p < .001). Among patients in ICU, the subjects with myocardial injury showed an increase need of endotracheal intubation (8 out of 9 [88%] vs 7 out of 19[37%], p = .042). Multivariate analyses showed that hs-TnI can significantly predict the degree of COVID-19 disease, the intubation need and in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we demonstrate that hs-Tn can significantly predict disease severity, intubation need and in-hospital death. Therefore, it may be reasonable to use Hs-Tn as a clinical tool in COVID-19 patients in order to triage them into different risk groups and can play a pivotal role in the detection of subjects at high risk of cardiac impairment during both the early and recovery stage.","Maino, Alessandro; Di Stasio, Enrico; Grimaldi, Maria Chiara; Cappannoli, Luigi; Rocco, Erica; Vergallo, Rocco; Biscetti, Federico; Baroni, Silvia; Urbani, Andrea; Landolfi, Raffaele; Biasucci, Luigi Marzio",Int J Cardiol,465,24

The IL-6-receptor blocker tocilizumab may control the aberrant host immune response in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) . In this pandemic, kidney transplant (KT) recipients are a high-risk population for severe infection and showed poor outcomes. We present a multicenter cohort study of 80 KT patients with severe COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab during hospital admission. High mortality rate was identified (32.5%), related with older age (hazard ratio [HR] 3.12 for those older than 60 years, P = .039). IL-6 and other inflammatory markers, including lactic acid dehydrogenase, ferritin, and D-dimer increased early after tocilizumab administration and their values were higher in nonsurvivors. Instead, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels decreased after tocilizumab, and this decrease positively correlated with survival (mean 12.3 mg/L in survivors vs. 33 mg/L in nonsurvivors). Each mg/L of CRP soon after tocilizumab increased the risk of death by 1% (HR 1.01 [confidence interval 1.004-1.024], P = .003). Although patients who died presented with worse respiratory situation at admission, this was not significantly different at tocilizumab administration and did not have an impact on outcome in the multivariate analysis. Tocilizumab may be effective in controlling cytokine storm in COVID-19 but randomized trials are needed.","Pérez-Sáez, María J; Blasco, Miquel; Redondo-Pachón, Dolores; Ventura-Aguiar, Pedro; Bada-Bosch, Teresa; Pérez-Flores, Isabel; Melilli, Edoardo; Sánchez-Cámara, Luis A; López-Oliva, María O; Canal, Cristina; Shabaka, Amir; Garra-Moncau, Núria; Martín-Moreno, Paloma L; López, Verónica; Hernández-Gallego, Román; Siverio, Orlando; Galeano, Cristina; Espí-Reig, Jordi; Cabezas, Carlos J; Rodrigo, María T; Llinàs-Mallol, Laura; Fernández-Reyes, María J; Cruzado-Vega, Leónidas; Pérez-Tamajón, Lourdes; Santana-Estupiñán, Raquel; Ruiz-Fuentes, María C; Tabernero, Guadalupe; Zárraga, Sofía; Ruiz, Juan C; Gutiérrez-Dalmau, Alex; Mazuecos, Auxiliadora; Sánchez-Álvarez, Emilio; Crespo, Marta; Pascual, Julio",Am. j. transplant,465,10

Host preparation to combat the virus is an important strategy to avoid COVID-19 severity. Thus, the relationship between eating habits, nutritional status and their effects on the immune response and further implications in viral respiratory infections is an important topic discussed in this review. Malnutrition causes the most diverse alterations in the immune system, suppressing of the immune response and increasing the susceptibility to infections such as SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, obesity induces low-grade chronic inflammation caused by excess adiposity, which increases angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. It decreases the immune response favouring SARS-CoV-2 virulence and promoting respiratory distress syndrome. The present review highlights the importance of food choices considering their inflammatory effects, consequently increasing the viral susceptibility observed in malnutrition and obesity. Healthy eating habits, micronutrients, bioactive compounds and probiotics are strategies for COVID-19 prevention. Therefore, a diversified and balanced diet can contribute to the improvement of the immune response to viral infections such as COVID-19.","Morais, Ana Heloneida de Araújo; Aquino, Jailane de Souza; da Silva-Maia, Juliana Kelly; Vale, Sancha Helena de Lima; Maciel, Bruna Leal Lima; Passos, Thaís Sousa",Br J Nutr,465,24

Our primary outcome was mortality. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission, intubation, vasopressor, and renal replacement therapy requirements were secondary outcomes. Multivariate regression analysis determined whether MT-DNA levels were independent of other reported COVID-19 risk factors. Receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve assessments were used to compare MT-DNA levels with established and emerging inflammatory markers of COVID-19.ResultsCirculating MT-DNA levels were highly elevated in patients who eventually died or required ICU admission, intubation, vasopressor use, or renal replacement therapy.

We also found that circulating MT-DNA levels had a similar or superior area under the curve when compared against clinically established measures of inflammation and emerging markers currently of interest as investigational targets for COVID-19 therapy.ConclusionThese results show that high circulating MT-DNA levels are a potential early indicator for poor COVID-19 outcomes.FundingWashington University Institute of Clinical Translational Sciences COVID-19 Research Program and Washington University Institute of Clinical Translational Sciences (ICTS) NIH grant UL1TR002345.","Scozzi, Davide; Cano, Marlene; Ma, Lina; Zhou, Dequan; Zhu, Ji Hong; O039,; Halloran, Jane A; Goss, Charles; Rauseo, Adriana M; Liu, Zhiyi; Sahu, Sanjaya K; Peritore, Valentina; Rocco, Monica; Ricci, Alberto; Amodeo, Rachele; Aimati, Laura; Ibrahim, Mohsen; Hachem, Ramsey; Kreisel, Daniel; Mudd, Philip A; Kulkarni, Hrishikesh S; Gelman, Andrew E",JCI insight,465,16

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 among people living with HIV (PLWH) in Tehran, Iran. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A total of 200 PLWH were recruited through the positive club via sampling, and completed the symptom-based questionnaire for COVID-19, which was delivered by trained peers. RESULTS: Of 200 participants, respiratory symptoms, including cough, sputum, and shortness of breath, were the most prevalent among participants, but only one person developed symptoms collectively suggested COVID-19 and sought treatments. CONCLUSION: It appears that existing infection with HIV or receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) might reduce the susceptibility to the infection with SARS-CoV-2 or decrease the severity of the infection acquired.

It has impacted the world medically, financially, politically and socially, with countries such as China and Italy adopting a full lockdown of their cities to mitigate the transmission. The current mortality rate is 5.4%, with 1 056 159 people infected worldwide. The disease is reminiscent of SARS in 2002, from which the healthcare system of Singapore has garnered many lessons and applied them in the current climate. As a result of the high transmissibility of the virus, hospitals in Singapore have reduced clinic loads and elective treatments to halt propagation of the virus and also to allow redistribution of healthcare workforce to the frontline. Cancer patients, who are often immunocompromised, are at risk of contracting the disease and becoming seriously ill. At the same time, delaying treatment such as radiotherapy in cancer patients can be detrimental. Here, we describe our experience as a large radiation oncology department in Singapore, including the challenges we encountered and how we managed our patient flow.","Tan, B F; Tuan, J K L; Yap, S P; Ho, S Z; Wang, M L C",Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol),465,6

One of the approaches often employed towards preventing the entry and proliferation of viruses is computer-aided inhibition studies to identify potent compounds that can inhibit activity of viral targets in the host through binding at the active site. In this study, we developed a pharmacophore model of reportedly potent drugs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV-1 and -2). The model was used to screen the ZINC database for commercially available compounds having similar features with the experimentally tested drugs. The top 3000 compounds retrieved were docked into the active sites of a homology-modelled TMPRSS2. Docking scores of the top binders were validated and the top-ranked compounds were subjected to ADME, Lipinski's and medicinal Chemistry property predictions for druglikeness analyses. Two lead compounds, ZINC64606047 and ZINC05296775, were identified having binding affinities higher than those of the reference inhibitors, favorable interactions with TMPRSS2 active site residues and good ADME and medicinal chemistry properties. Molecular dynamics simulation was used to assess the stability and dynamics of the interactions of these compounds with TMPRSS2. Binding free energy and contribution energy evaluations were determined using MMPBSA method. Analyses of the trajectory dynamics collectively established further that the lead compounds bound and interacted stably with active site residues of TMPRSS2. Nonetheless, experimental studies are needed to further assess the potentials of these compounds as possible therapeutics against coronaviruses. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

METHODS: Data were collected on presentations of newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes as well as on all paediatric presentations to the emergency department of a tertiary centre between 2015 and 2020. Data from the period of initial COVID restrictions in Australia (March to May 2020) were compared to the period March to May of the previous 5 years (pre-pandemic periods). RESULTS: The number of new diagnoses of type 1 diabetes was comparable in the pandemic period and pre-pandemic periods (11 in 2020 vs range 6-10 in 2015-2019). The frequency of severe diabetic ketoacidosis was significantly higher in the pandemic period compared to the pre-pandemic periods (45% vs 5%; P <0.003), odds ratio 16.7 (95% CI 2.0, 194.7). The overall frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis was also significantly higher during the pandemic period (73% vs 26%; P <0.007), odds ratio 7.5 (95% CI 1.7, 33.5).

Presentations of people aged <18 years to the emergency department decreased by 27% in the pandemic period compared to the average of the pre-pandemic periods (4799 vs 6550; range 6268 to 7131). CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase in the frequency of severe diabetic ketoacidosis at presentation of type 1 diabetes was observed during the initial period of COVID-19 restrictions. We hypothesize that concern about presenting to hospital during a pandemic led to a delay in diagnosis. These data have important implications for advocacy of seeking healthcare for non-pandemic-related conditions during a global pandemic.","Lawrence, C; Seckold, R; Smart, C; King, B R; Howley, P; Feltrin, R; Smith, T A; Roy, R; Lopez, P",Diabet Med,465,23

Both the “U2” combination (anti-CD20 mAb ublituximab + the PI3Kδ-CK1ϵ inhibitor umbralisib) and BTK inhibition are highly active in treatment-naïve (TN) and relapsed/ refractory (R/R) CLL, each having previously demonstrated superiority over standard chemoimmunotherapy. Herein we report the results of the dose escalation of TG-1701 monotherapy and TG-1701+U2. Methods: Patients (pts) with R/R CLL, MCL and Waldenström's (WM) were enrolled in an ongoing Ph 1 study initially evaluating dose escalation (DE) of oral TG-1701 QD continuously administered in 28-day cycles (100, 200, 300, and 400 mg). After characterizing the safety profile of TG-1701 monotherapy, we implemented a parallel DE arm of TG-1701+U2. Select dose levels of TG-1701 monotherapy were expanded. All pts were treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or investigator/patient decision to withdraw. Results: As of 03 February 2021, 123 pts were treated with TG-1701 as follows: 25 in the monotherapy DE arm, 61 in the 200 mg disease-specific cohorts (20 CLL [5 TN], 21 MCL [4 TN], 20 WM [8 TN]), 20 in the 300 mg CLL cohort (4 TN), and 17 in the 1701+U2 DE arm. The median # of prior therapies was 1 (range, 1-10). All pts were BTKi-naïve. All 123 pts were evaluable for safety. TG-1701 was well tolerated and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for monotherapy was not reached at 400 mg (demonstrating near 100% saturation of the BTK at all dose levels studied). Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) of clinical interest included atrial fibrillation (AF 4.0% of pts, G ≥3 in 1 case), G ≥3 hypertension (2.4%), and bleeding events (18.7%, all G1-2). No cases of ventricular tachyarrhythmia were reported. TEAEs leading to TG-1701 dose reduction occurred in 6.5% of pts. TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 1.6% of pts (AF, COVID-19). At the data cut-off, 119 pts were evaluable for response, including 40 in DE (Table). The median duration of response has not been reached among responders overall. The median follow-up (mFU range) was 15.9 mos (1.3-28.6+) in DE and 8.5 mos (1.4-15.6+) in disease-specific cohorts. Best change from baseline in tumor burden in pts in the 1701+U2 combination arm is presented in the figure below. Conclusions: TG-1701 exhibits an encouraging safety and efficacy profile. The combination of 1701+U2 has been well tolerated and dose escalation continues. The combination shows enhanced depth of response over TG-1701 monotherapy.","Cheah, C.

The present study examined the demographic, socioeconomic, and health system-related vulnerabilities shaping COVID-19 risk across 36 states and union territories in India. STUDY DESIGN: Using secondary data from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India; Census of India, 2011; National Family Health Survey, 2015-16; and various rounds of the National Sample Survey, we examined socioeconomic vulnerabilities associated with COVID-19 risk at the sub-national level in India from March 16, 2020 to May 03, 2020. METHODS: Descriptive statistics, principal component analysis (PCA), and the negative binomial regression model were used to examine the predictors of COVID-19 risk in India. RESULTS: There persist substantial heterogeneities in the COVID-19 risk across states and union territories in India. The underlying demographic, socioeconomic and health infrastructure characteristics drive the vulnerabilities related to COVID-19 in India.

We aimed to compare projected COVID-19 mortality under four different strategies for the prioritisation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. METHODS: We developed a coupled social-epidemiological model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in which social and epidemiological dynamics interact with one another. We modelled how population adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions responds to case incidence. In the model, schools and workplaces are also closed and reopened on the basis of reported cases. The model was parameterised with data on COVID-19 cases and mortality, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, population mobility, and demography from Ontario, Canada (population 14·5 million). Disease progression parameters came from the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological literature. We assumed a vaccine with 75% efficacy against disease and transmissibility. We compared vaccinating those aged 60 years and older first (oldest-first strategy), vaccinating those younger than 20 years first (youngest-first strategy), vaccinating uniformly by age (uniform strategy), and a novel contact-based strategy. The latter three strategies interrupt transmission, whereas the first targets a vulnerable group to reduce disease. Vaccination rates ranged from 0·5% to 5% of the population per week, beginning on either Jan 1 or Sept 1, 2021. FINDINGS: Case notifications, non-pharmaceutical intervention adherence, and lockdown undergo successive waves that interact with the timing of the vaccine programme to determine the relative effectiveness of the four strategies. Transmission-interrupting strategies become relatively more effective with time as herd immunity builds. The model predicts that, in the absence of vaccination, 72 000 deaths (95% credible interval 40 000-122 000) would occur in Ontario from Jan 1, 2021, to March 14, 2025, and at a vaccination rate of 1·5% of the population per week, the oldest-first strategy would reduce COVID-19 mortality by 90·8% on average (followed by 89·5% in the uniform, 88·9% in the contact-based, and 88·2% in the youngest-first strategies). 60 000 deaths (31 000-108 000) would occur from Sept 1, 2021, to March 14, 2025, in the absence of vaccination, and the contact-based strategy would reduce COVID-19 mortality by 92·6% on average (followed by 92·1% in the uniform, 91·0% in the oldest-first, and 88·3% in the youngest-first strategies) at a vaccination rate of 1·5% of the population per week. INTERPRETATION: The most effective vaccination strategy for reducing mortality due to COVID-19 depends on the time course of the pandemic in the population. For later vaccination start dates, use of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to interrupt transmission might prevent more deaths than prioritising vulnerable age groups.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel. The government can further strengthen restrictions and reduce spread within the nation more effectively by implementing restrictions on interstate travel.","Shah, Nita H; Sheoran, Nisha; Jayswal, Ekta; Shukla, Dhairya; Shukla, Nehal; Shukla, Jagdish; Shah, Yash",J Math Anal Appl,465,18

Patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection were assigned to recovery group if they made a full recovery and to death group if they died within 2 months of hospitalization. Chest CT examinations for ground-glass opacity, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation, and fibrosis were scored by two reviewers. The total CT score comprised the sum of lung involvement (5 lobes, scores 1-5 for each lobe, range; 0, none; 25, maximum). 40 patients who recovered from COVID-19 and six patients who died were enrolled. The initial chest CTs showed 27 (58.7%) patients had ground-glass opacity, 19 (41.3%) had ground glass and consolidation, and 35 (76.1%) patients had crazy-paving pattern. None of the patients who died had fibrosis in contrast to six (15%) patients who recovered from COVID-19. Most patients had subpleural lesions (89.0%) as well as bilateral (87.0%) and lower (93.0%) lung lobe involvement. Diffuse lesions were present in four (67%) patients who succumbed to coronavirus but only one (2.5%) patient who recovered (p < 0.001). In the death group of patients, the total CT score was higher than that of the recovery group (p = 0.005). Patients in the death group had lower lymphocyte count and higher C-reactive protein than those in the recovery group (p = 0.011 and p = 0.041, respectively).

The frontline health workers are in constant risk due to the etiology and mode of transmission of the disease. Thus, the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is very crucial during this pandemic. This study is to assess the knowledge regarding the handling of personal protective equipment among frontline allied health professionals who are directly in contact with COVID-19 patients. A standard questionnaire was prepared in Google forms and circulated within the network of healthcare workers via online platforms. A total of 143 frontline health workers participated in the questionnaire Survey. It was found that only 44.1% of the total participants had previously undergone training regarding the handling of PPE. About 86.0% of participants gave correct response to the safety etiquette questions. For another knowledge-based question about using the N95 respirator in conjunction with a Face shield, 86.7% of participants responded correctly. Only 67.8% of participants gave the right response to the question regarding the sequence of donning and doffing of PPE. The last question was regarding knowledge about the disposal of PPE, where 95.8% of PPE responded correctly.

An evidence-based opinion,19.695435,3.2407217,2021,"PURPOSE FOR REVIEW: Since the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in China in late 2019 turned into a global pandemic, numerous studies have reported associations between environmental factors, such as weather conditions and a range of air pollutants (particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, etc.) and the first wave of COVID-19 cases. This review aims to offer a critical assessment of the role of environmental exposure risk factors on SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 disease severity. RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, we provide a critical assessment of COVID-19 risk factors, identify gaps in our knowledge (e.g., indoor air pollution), and discuss methodological challenges of association and causation and the impact lockdowns had on air quality. In addition, we will draw attention to ethnic and socioeconomic factors driving viral transmission related to COVID-19. The complex role angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays in COVID-19 and future promising avenues of research are discussed. To demonstrate causality, we stress the need for future epidemiologic studies integrating personal air pollution exposures, detailed clinical COVID-19 data, and a range of socioeconomic factors, as well as in vitro and in vivo mechanistic studies.","Brandt, Eric B; Mersha, Tesfaye B",Curr Allergy Asthma Rep,465,27

METHODS: A survey was conducted in all 6 neurosurgical departments in the Veneto region to collect data about surgical, inpatient care and endovascular procedures during the month of March for each year from 2016 to 2020. Safety measures to avoid infection from SARS-CoV-2 and any COVID-19 cases reported among neurosurgical patients or staff members were considered. RESULTS: The mean number of neurosurgical admissions for the month of March over the 2016-2019 period was 663, whereas in March 2020 admissions decreased by 42%. Emergency admissions decreased by 23%. The average number of neurosurgical procedures was 697, and declined by 30% (range -10% to -51% in individual centers). Emergency procedures decreased in the same period by 23%. Subarachnoid hemorrhage and spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage both decreased in Veneto-by 25% and 22%, respectively. Coiling for unruptured aneurysm, coiling for ruptured aneurysm, and surgery for ruptured aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation diminished by 49%, 27%, and 78%, respectively. Endovascular procedures for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) increased by 33% in 2020 (28 procedures in total). There was a slight decrease (8%) in brain tumor surgeries. Neurosurgical admissions decreased by 25% and 35% for head trauma and spinal trauma, respectively, while surgical procedures for head trauma diminished by 19% and procedures for spinal trauma declined by 26%. Admissions and surgical treatments for degenerative spine were halved. Eleven healthcare workers and 8 patients were infected in the acute phase of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter study describes the effects of a COVID-19 outbreak on neurosurgical activities in a vast region in Italy. Remodulation of neurosurgical activities has resulted in a significant reduction of elective and emergency surgeries compared to previous years. Most likely this is a combined result of cancellation of elective and postponable surgeries, increase of conservative management, increase in social restrictions, and in patients' fear of accessing hospitals. Curiously, only endovascular procedures for AIS have increased, possibly due to reduced physical activity or increased thrombosis in SARS-CoV-2. The confounding effect of thrombectomy increase over time cannot be excluded. No conclusion can be drawn on AIS incidence. Active monitoring with nasopharyngeal swabs, wearing face masks, and using separate pathways for infected patients reduce the risk of infection.","Raneri, Fabio; Rustemi, Oriela; Zambon, Giampaolo; Del Moro, Giulia; Magrini, Salima; Ceccaroni, Yuri; Basso, Elisabetta; Volpin, Francesco; Cappelletti, Martina; Lardani, Jacopo; Ferraresi, Stefano; Guida, Franco; Chioffi, Franco; Pinna, Giampietro; Canova, Giuseppe; d039,; Avella, Domenico; Sala, Francesco; Volpin, Lorenzo",Neurosurg Focus,465,16

A quality-quantity tradeoff was recently discovered in spore forming bacteria, but whether it impacts fitness is unclear. Here we show both theoretically and experimentally that the nutrient supply during spore revival determines the fitness advantage associated with different sporulation behaviors in Bacillus subtilis. By tuning sporulation rates we generate spore-yield and spore-quality strategists that compete with each other in a microscopic life-cycle assay. The quality (yield) strategist is favored when spore revival is triggered by poor (rich) nutrients. We also show that natural isolates from the gut and soil employ different life-cycle strategies that result from genomic variations in the number of rap-phr signaling systems. Taken together, our results suggest that a spore quality-quantity tradeoff contributes to the evolutionary adaptation of sporulating bacteria.","Mutlu, Alper; Kaspar, Charlotte; Becker, Nils; Bischofs, Ilka B",,465,26

We describe a case series of three patients each of whom tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal swab specimens and presented with pneumothorax. These patients were treated at the New York City Health and Hospitals (NYC H+H) system, a network of eleven hospitals in four different boroughs of New York City. None of these patients had a history of lung disease and one patient was a previous smoker. One out of three patients died. Inflammatory markers were noted to be elevated in each of these patients to levels that have been associated with severe COVID-19 infection. CT scans in these patients showed bilateral air space disease consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia and pneumothorax with other features including pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, and pneumatoceles. This may indicate the underlying pathogenesis of pneumothorax in these patients to involve inflammation-induced pulmonary parenchymal injury and necrosis with subsequent development of air leaks into the pleural cavity, a mechanism similar to that noted in patients during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. Conservative management with chest tube drainage or observation was adequate for two of three patients while one patient developed multi-organ system dysfunction and eventual death.","Mallick, Taha; Dinesh, Anant; Engdahl, Ryan; Sabado, Mario",Cureus,465,30

In New York City during the surge in COVID-19 cases, a systematic approach to monitoring and triaging immunocompromised transplant patients was required in the context of strained healthcare resources, limited outpatient testing, and heightened hospital exposure risks. Public health guidance at the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak recommended outpatient monitoring of mildly symptomatic patients without specific recommendations for special populations such as transplant recipients. We developed and implemented a systematic monitoring algorithm for kidney transplant recipients at our transplant center who reported mild symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. We describe the outcomes of the first 44 patients monitored through this algorithm. A total of 44 kidney transplant recipients thought to be symptomatic for COVID-19 disease were followed for a minimum of 14 days. The majority of mildly symptomatic patients (34/44) had clinical progression of disease and were referred to the emergency department where they all tested PCR positive and required hospitalization. More than half of these patients presented with hypoxia requiring supplemental oxygen, 39% were intubated within 48 hours, and 53% developed acute kidney injury but did not require dialysis. There were 6 deaths. During surge outbreaks, kidney transplant patients with even mild symptoms have a high likelihood of COVID-19 disease and most will worsen requiring hospitalization for supportive measures.

Hence, we assessed the impact of dental pain, fear of COVID-19 and psychological distress during lockdown on the oral health related quality of life of individuals visiting a tertiary dental care center during COVID-19 pandemic. Cross sectional study conducted among patients between 18-60 years. Demographics, access to pain killers, dental care (yes/no), duration (> 15 days) and intensity of pain were self reported. Fear of COVID-19 was assessed using fear of corona virus scale (FCV-19S); psychological distress in the last 30 days and oral health related quality of life was evaluated. Oral examination was performed and dental caries status (DMFT) was assessed using the world health organization method.

METHODS: Data from a longitudinal adult population-based cohort from the provinces of Madrid and Barcelona were analysed (n = 1103). Structured face-to-face home-based interviews (pre-pandemic) and telephone interviews were performed. Both depression and suicidal ideation were assessed through an adaptation of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI 3.0). A variety of validated instruments and sociodemographic variables including age, sex, educational level, occupational status, home quietness, screen time, resilience, loneliness, social support, physical activity, disability, economic situation and COVID-19-related information were also considered. Population prevalence estimates and multivariable logistic regressions were computed. RESULTS: Overall, prevalence rates of depression and suicidal ideation did not change significantly from before to after the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the rates of depression among individuals aged 50+ years showed a significant decrease compared to before the pandemic (from 8.48 to 6.41%; p = 0.01). Younger individuals (odds ratio (OR) = 0.97 per year older; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.95-0.99) and those feeling loneliness (OR = 1.96; 95% CI = 1.42-2.70) during the lockdown were at an increased risk of developing depression during the confinement. Resilience showed a protective effect against the risk of depression (OR = 0.46; 95% CI = 0.32-0.66) and suicidal ideation (OR = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.16-0.68), whereas individuals perceiving social support were at a lower risk of developing suicidal thoughts (OR = 0.35; 95% CI = 0.18-0.69).

The goal of this review is to systematically identify and describe the survey data and findings to date examining the effect on individual gambling and gambling disorder. RECENT FINDINGS: Of the 17 publications meeting inclusion criteria, the majority reported cross-sectional assessments (nâ=â11, 65%) and remainder were longitudinal in that they had earlier gambling data for participants (nâ=â6, 35%). Not surprisingly given the closure of land-based gambling, an overall reduction in gambling frequency and expenditure was reported in all studies. The estimate of the proportion of participants in both the general population and the population that gambles who increased overall gambling or online gambling was variable. The most consistent correlates of increased gambling during the lockdown were increased problem gambling severity, younger age groups, and being male. SUMMARY: These results suggest that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on gambling and problematic gambling are diverse - possibly causing a reduction in current or future problems in some, but also promoting increased problematic gambling in others. The longer-term implications of both the reduction in overall gambling, and the increase in some vulnerable groups are unclear, and requires assessment in subsequent follow-up studies. However, in the short term, individuals with existing gambling problems should be recognized as a vulnerable group.","Hodgins, David C; Stevens, Rhys M G",Curr Opin Psychiatry,465,16

RESULTS: Children presenting with moderate-severe COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease shock-like syndrome exhibit peripheral blood picture analogous to HLH. HScore, a validated tool to diagnose HLH, has been suggested to screen severe COVID-19 patients for cytokine storm. However, HScore faces certain limitations in this scenario. It may be more pragmatic to use 'high D-dimer' (> 3 µg/mL) instead of 'low fibrinogen' to facilitate early detection of cytokine storm. COVID-19 associated coagulopathy resembles hypercoagulable form of DIC with bleeding being rarely reported. Although the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) interim guidance recommends low molecular weight heparin in all hospitalized patients, data is lacking in population below 14 years of age. However, in the presence of life-threatening thromboembolic event or symptomatic acro-ischemia, unfractionated heparin (UFH) should be used with caution. CONCLUSION: HScore can be used as a complement to clinical decision for initiating immunosuppression.

A major effort was completed to compare 17 serological tests available in April 2020 in Switzerland. METHODS: In a preliminary phase, we compared 17 IgG, IgM, IgA and pan Ig serological tests including ELISA, LFA, CLIA and ECLIA on a panel of 182 sera, comprising 113 sera from hospitalized patients with a positive RT-PCR, and 69 sampled before 1st November 2019, expected to give a positive and negative results, respectively. In a second phase, the five best performing and most available tests were further evaluated on a total of 582 sera (178 and 404 expected positive and negative, respectively), allowing the assessment of 20 possible cross-reactions with other viruses. RESULTS: In the preliminary phase, among eight IgG/pan-Ig ELISA or CLIA/ECLIA tests, five had a sensitivity and specificity above 90 % and 98 % respectively, and on six IgM/IgA tests, only one was acceptable. Only one LFA test on three showed good performances for both IgG and IgM. For all the tests IgM and IgG aroused concomitantly. In the second phase, no test showed particular cross-reaction. We observed an important heterogeneity in the development of the antibody response. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the evaluated tests exhibited high performances of IgG/pan-Ig sensitivity and specificity to detect the serological response of moderately to critically ill hospitalized patients. The IgM and IgA tests showed mostly insufficient performances with no added value for the early diagnostic on the cohort tested in this study.","Coste, Alix T; Jaton, Katia; Papadimitriou-Olivgeris, Matthaios; Greub, Gilbert; Croxatto, Antony",J Clin Virol,465,25

B cell depletion via the targeting of the surface molecule CD20 has proven to be highly effective; however, continuous absence of an integral component of the immune system may cause safety concerns over time. Declining humoral competence and potential immune system impairments are key issues, and moreover, unselective removal of B cells reduces immune system control functions which should preferably be maintained in inflammatory CNS disease. AREAS COVERED: This paper illuminates the novel approach of specific interference with B cell signaling by targeting Bruton´s tyrosine kinase (BTK). We discuss the role of BTK within the B cell receptor (BCR) signaling cascade and BTK inhibition as a promising strategy to control inflammatory CNS disease which crucially excludes immune-cell depletion. We searched PubMed or clinicaltrials.gov for the terms 'BTK inhibition' or 'Bruton´s Tyrosine Kinase' or 'anti-CD20' and 'Multiple Sclerosis'. EXPERT OPINION: BTK inhibition has shown effectiveness in preclinical models of CNS disease and MS clinical trials. Further studies are necessary to differentiate this approach from B cell depletion and to position it in the armamentarium of therapeutics.","Torke, Sebastian; Weber, Martin S",Expert Opin Investig Drugs,465,5

These unintended consequences can be far-reaching and just as important as the intended ones. The World Health Organization identified the assessment of unintended consequences of COVID-19 mitigation measures as a top priority. Thus far, however, their systematic assessment has been neglected due to the inattention of researchers as well as the lack of training and practical tools. MAIN TEXT: Over six years our team has gained extensive experience conducting research on the unintended consequences of complex health interventions. Through a reflexive process, we developed insights that can be useful for researchers in this area. Our analysis is based on key literature and lessons learned reflexively in conducting multi-site and multi-method studies on unintended consequences. Here we present practical guidance for researchers wishing to assess the unintended consequences of COVID-19 mitigation measures. To ensure resource allocation, protocols should include research questions regarding unintended consequences at the outset. Social science theories and frameworks are available to help assess unintended consequences. To determine which changes are unintended, researchers must first understand the intervention theory. To facilitate data collection, researchers can begin by forecasting potential unintended consequences through literature reviews and discussions with stakeholders. Including desirable and neutral unintended consequences in the scope of study can help minimize the negative bias reported in the literature. Exploratory methods can be powerful tools to capture data on the unintended consequences that were unforeseen by researchers. We recommend researchers cast a wide net by inquiring about different aspects of the mitigation measures. Some unintended consequences may only be observable in subsequent years, so longitudinal approaches may be useful. An equity lens is necessary to assess how mitigation measures may unintentionally increase disparities. Finally, stakeholders can help validate the classification of consequences as intended or unintended. CONCLUSION: Studying the unintended consequences of COVID-19 mitigation measures is not only possible but also necessary to assess their overall value. The practical guidance presented will help program planners and evaluators gain a more comprehensive understanding of unintended consequences to refine mitigation measures.","Turcotte-Tremblay, Anne-Marie; Gali Gali, Idriss Ali; Ridde, Valéry",BMC Med Res Methodol,465,16

associated with diverse clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic infection to lethal complications Small studies have suggested inferior outcomes in patients (pts) on active cancer treatment This finding was not independently validated in our prior report on 928 pts, which included treatments administered within 4 weeks of COVID-19 diagnosis Here, we examine outcomes related to systemic cancer treatment within one year of lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in an expanded cohort Methods: The COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) registry (NCT04354701) was queried for pts ever receiving systemic treatment Treatment type, cancer type, stage, and COVID-19 outcomes were examined Pts were stratified by time from last treatment administration: &lt;2 wk, 2-4 wk, 1-3 mo, or 3-12 mo Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) of mortality by treatment type and timing were calculated Results: As of 31 July 2020, we analyzed 3920 pts;42% received systemic anti-cancer treatment within 12 mo (Table) 159 distinct medications were administered The highest rate of COVID-19-associated complications were observed in pts treated within 1-3 months prior to COVID-19;all-cause mortality in this group was 26% 30-day mortality by most recent treatment type was 20% for chemotherapy, 18% for immunotherapy, 17% for chemoradiotherapy, 29% for chemoimmunotherapy, 20% for targeted therapy, and 11% for endocrine therapy SIR of mortality was highest for chemoimmunotherapy or chemotherapy &lt;2 wks, and lowest for endocrine treatments A high SIR was also found for targeted agents within 3-12 mo Pts untreated in the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis had a mortality of 14% [Formula presented] Conclusions: 30-day mortality was highest amongst cancer pts treated 1-3 months prior to COVID-19

Presently this has affected 216 countries, areas or territories worldwide, spreading of this disease is very fast in USA, Brazil, and Russia than in the country of its origin, China. Like other coronaviruses, this may develop respiratory tract infections in the patients range from mild to fatal illness like pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). As of now, no effective drug, vaccine, or any procedure is available and experiments are underway. However, empirical therapy is being followed to manage and save the lives of the patients. There is a need for pharmacological alternatives to combat this deadly virus and its complications. Based on the previous experiences with similar coronavirus management and present preliminary data from uncontrolled studies, drugs like chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and favipiravir have been recommended by the researchers to manage COVID-19. This review had assessed the potential mechanisms, safety profile, availability and cost of these drugs. This review concludes that the drugs mentioned above are having different properties and act differently in combating the COVID-19 viruses. Instead of single drug, combination of antivirals with different mechanism of action may be more effective and at the same time their adverse events should not be underestimated.","Venkatasubbaiah, Meda; Dwarakanadha Reddy, P.; Satyanarayana, Suggala V.",Curr.

However, we find that the existing systems lack functionality and flexibility, which may hurt the success of the contact tracing. Specifically, they cannot detect indirect contact (e.g., people may be exposed to coronavirus because of used the same elevator even without direct contact); they also cannot flexibly change the rules of""risky contact"", such as how many hours of exposure or how close to a COVID-19 patient that is considered as risk exposure, which may be changed with the environmental situation. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure contact tracing system that enables both direct contact and indirect contact. To address the above problems, we need to utilize users' trajectory data for private contact tracing, which we call trajectory-based PCT. We formalize this problem as Spatiotemporal Private Set Intersection. By analyzing different approaches such as homomorphic encryption that could be extended to solve this problem, we identify that Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is a proposing method to achieve our requirements. The major challenge is how to design algorithms for spatiotemporal private set intersection under limited secure memory of TEE. To this end, we design a TEE-based system with flexible trajectory data encoding algorithms. Our experiments on real-world data show that the proposed system can process thousands of queries on tens of million records of trajectory data in a few seconds.","Kato, Fumiyuki; Cao, Yang; Masatoshi, Yoshikawa",,465,16

Cellular modules are key units of adaptive evolution because organismal fitness depends on their performance. Theory shows that in rapidly evolving populations, such as those of many microbes, adaptation is driven primarily by common beneficial mutations with large effects, while other mutations behave as if they are effectively neutral. As a consequence, if a module can be improved only by rare and/or weak beneficial mutations, its adaptive evolution would stall. However, such evolutionary stalling has not been empirically demonstrated, and it is unclear to what extent stalling may limit the power of natural selection to improve modules. Here we empirically characterize how natural selection improves the translation machinery (TM), an essential cellular module. We experimentally evolved populations of Escherichia coli with genetically perturbed TMs for 1,000 generations. Populations with severe TM defects initially adapted via mutations in the TM, but TM adaptation stalled within about 300 generations. We estimate that the genetic load in our populations incurred by residual TM defects ranges from 0.5 to 19%. Finally, we found evidence that both epistasis and the depletion of the pool of beneficial mutations contributed to evolutionary stalling. Our results suggest that cellular modules may not be fully optimized by natural selection despite the availability of adaptive mutations.","Venkataram, Sandeep; Monasky, Ross; Sikaroodi, Shohreh H; Kryazhimskiy, Sergey; Kacar, Betul",Proc.

The anti-tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) demonstrates non-specific protective innate immune-boosting effects. Here, we determined if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion in a retrospective observational study of a diverse cohort of health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: We assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and collected medical questionnaires, including BCG vaccination status and pre-existing demographic and clinical characteristics, from an observational cohort of HCWs in a multi-site Los Angeles healthcare organization. We used multi-variate analysis to estimate if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion. RESULTS: Of the 6,201 HCWs, 29.6% reported a history of BCG vaccination whereas 68.9% did not receive BCG vaccination. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG as well as incidence of self-reported clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 were significantly decreased among HCWs with a history of BCG vaccination compared to those without BCG vaccination. After adjusting for age and sex, we found that history of BCG vaccination, but not meningococcal, pneumococcal or influenza vaccination, was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion. CONCLUSIONS: History of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and reduced reported COVID-19-related clinical symptoms in this cohort of HCWs. Therefore, large randomized prospective clinical trials of BCG vaccination are urgently needed to confirm if BCG vaccination can induced a protective effect against SARS-CoV2 infection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included infants who received liver MRI examinations to evaluate cholestasis from July 2009 to October 2017. Liver ADC, ADC ratio of liver/spleen, aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), and spleen size were compared between the BA and non-BA groups. The diagnostic performances of all parameters for significant fibrosis (F3-4) were obtained by receiver-operating characteristics (ROCs) curve analysis. RESULTS: Altogether, 227 infants (98 males and 129 females, mean age = 57.2 ± 36.3 days) including 125 BA patients were analyzed. The absolute ADC difference between two reviewers was 0.10 mm²/s for both liver and spleen. Liver ADC value was specific (80.4%) and ADC ratio was sensitive (88.0%) for the diagnosis of BA with comparable performance. There were 33 patients with F0, 15 with F1, 71 with F2, 35 with F3, and 11 with F4. All four parameters of APRI (&#964; = 0.296), spleen size (&#964; = 0.312), liver ADC (&#964; = -0.206), and ADC ratio (&#964; = -0.288) showed significant correlation with fibrosis grade (all, p < 0.001). The cutoff values for significant fibrosis (F3-4) were 0.783 for APRI (area under the ROC curve [AUC], 0.721), 5.9 cm for spleen size (AUC, 0.719), 1.044 × 10-3 mm²/s for liver ADC (AUC, 0.673), and 1.22 for ADC ratio (AUC, 0.651). CONCLUSION: Liver ADC values and ADC ratio of liver/spleen showed limited additional diagnostic performance for differentiating BA from non-BA and predicting significant hepatic fibrosis in infants with cholestasis.","Kim, Jisoo; Shin, Hyun Joo; Yoon, Haesung; Han, Seok Joo; Koh, Hong; Kim, Myung Joon; Lee, Mi Jung",Korean j. radiol,465,16

DESIGN: Individuals at 'high risk' of COVID-19 were identified using the published national 'Shielded Patient List' criteria. Individual-level information, including current chronic conditions, historical healthcare utilisation and demographic and socioeconomic status, was used for descriptive analyses of this group using PHM methods. Segmentation used k-prototypes cluster analysis. SETTING: A major healthcare system in the South West of England, for which linked primary, secondary, community and mental health data are available in a system-wide dataset. The study was performed at a time considered to be relatively early in the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: 1 013 940 individuals from 78 contributing general practices. RESULTS: Compared with the groups considered at 'low' and 'moderate' risk (ie, eligible for the annual influenza vaccination), individuals at high risk were older (median age: 68 years (IQR: 55-77 years), cf 30 years (18-44 years) and 63 years (38-73 years), respectively), with more primary care/community contacts in the previous year (median contacts: 5 (2-10), cf 0 (0-2) and 2 (0-5)) and had a higher burden of comorbidity (median Charlson Score: 4 (3-6), cf 0 (0-0) and 2 (1-4)).

In hospitals, health-care workers wear facemasks as a minimum medical “droplet precaution” to protect themselves. Due to the shortage of masks during the pandemic, priority is given to hospitals for their distribution. As a result, the availability/use of medical masks is discouraged for the public. However, for asymptomatic individuals, not wearing masks in public could easily cause the spread of COVID-19. The prevention of “environmental droplet contamination” (EnvDC) from coughing/sneezing/speech is fundamental to reducing transmission. As an immediate solution to promote “public droplet safety,” we assessed household textiles to quantify their potential as effective environmental droplet barriers (EDBs). The synchronized implementation of a universal “community droplet reduction solution” is discussed as a model against COVID-19. Using a bacterial-suspension spray simulation model of droplet ejection (mimicking a sneeze), we quantified the extent by which widely available clothing fabrics reduce the dispersion of droplets onto surfaces within 1.8 m, the minimum distance recommended for COVID-19 “social distancing.” All textiles reduced the number of droplets reaching surfaces, restricting their dispersion to &lt;30 cm, when used as single layers. When used as double-layers, textiles were as effective as medical mask/surgical-cloth materials, reducing droplet dispersion to &lt;10 cm, and the area of circumferential contamination to ~0.3%. The synchronized implementation of EDBs as a “community droplet reduction solution” (i.e., face covers/scarfs/masks and surface covers) will reduce COVID-19 EnvDC and thus the risk of transmitting/acquiring COVID-19.","Rodriguez-Palacios, Alex; Cominelli, Fabio; Basson, Abigail R.; Pizarro, Theresa T.; Ilic, Sanja",Front.

In September 2020, six months after the COVID-19 pandemic hit the UK and caused a major disruption of surgical services, we decided to investigate the usefulness of the project and the impact of COVID-19 in the operating theatres, looking through the eyes of the Human Factors Champions. Results pointed to a consensus about ONSeT having helped during the pandemic, with regards to how teams worked and in enabling team leaders to be more responsive. Human Factors Champions found that feedback on performance was received in a non-threatening way and observation of performance became 'second nature'.

The clinical management has dramatically altered and it was necessary to change and/or adapt it to the new situation. Regarding relapses management, the use of intravenous corticosteroids and hospitalization during MS relapses increase the risk of viral exposure. OBJECTIVE: To review the efficacy and safety of high dose oral corticosteroids in acute relapses treatment compared to intravenous corticosteroids. METHODS: Descriptive review of the utility of high dose oral corticosteroids for MS relapses treatment was performed. We searched the literature available on PubMed and Scientific Electronic Library Online (Scielo). We focused on different trials comparing the use of high dose intravenous vs oral corticosteroids. RESULTS: Five studies were selected. One hundred and eighty two patients receiving treatment with high dose oral corticosteroids were included. The most frequent schedule was oral methylprednisolone 1000 mg (over three days). There were no significant differences between both routes of corticosteroids administration. CONCLUSION: Neurologists should be aware of the current evidence on the similar efficacy of both oral and intravenous corticosteroids for MS relapses. Using oral steroids during the pandemic would be a safe option for patients.","Segamarchi, Constanza; Silva, Berenice; Saidon, Patricia; Garcea, Orlando; Alonso, Ricardo",Mult Scler Relat Disord,465,16

Nurses on the frontlines are particularly vulnerable to the adversity of working under these conditions, particularly with regard to mental health. Thus, understanding risk and protective factors for this vulnerable and essential group is critical for identifying potential targets of interventions. We had two aims for the current study: (a) to examine work functioning and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress (PTSD) among nurses who did and did not care for patients with COVID-19;and (b) to determine if resilience and social support moderate these relationships. Methods: For three weeks in July 2020, nurses across the United States were invited to participate in an online survey collecting data on demographics, resilience, social support, and screening measures of depression, PTSD, anxiety, and distracted practice. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and hierarchical regression for each outcome measure. Conclusions: Our findings support a growing body of research reporting that nurses are experiencing mental health sequelae during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially those providing direct care to patients with the virus. We found that compared to nurses who did not care for patients with COVID-19, those who did reported increased symptoms of PTSD, depression, and anxiety. A novel contribution is our finding that nurses providing direct COVID-19 care also experienced increased levels of distracted practice, a behavioral measure of distraction linking to a potential impact on patient care. We also found that resilience and social support acted as moderators of some of these relationships. Fostering resilience and social support may help buffer the effects of providing care to patients with COVID-19 and could potentially decrease nurse vulnerability to developing psychological symptoms and impairment on the job. © The Author(s) 2021.","Schierberl Scherr, A.

Using this SEIR model, and projections of critical driving covariates (pneumonia seasonality, mobility, testing rates and mask use per capita), we assessed scenarios of social distancing mandates and levels of mask use. Projections of current non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies by state-with social distancing mandates reinstated when a threshold of 8 deaths per million population is exceeded (reference scenario)-suggest that, cumulatively, 511,373 (469,578-578,347) lives could be lost to COVID-19 across the United States by 28 February 2021. We find that achieving universal mask use (95% mask use in public) could be sufficient to ameliorate the worst effects of epidemic resurgences in many states.

BACKGROUND: Nurses' job performance is important in the effective and efficient provision of health care. DESIGN: A descriptive, cross-sectional study. The STROBE guidelines were used in this study. METHODS: The sample of this descriptive, correlational and cross-sectional study comprised 370 nurses working at one private and two university hospitals in Turkey. A demographic information form, the Practice Work Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index (PES-NWI) and the Nursing Job Performance Scale (JPS) were used to collect the data. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Spearman's correlation and multiple linear (stepwise) regression. RESULTS: There was a significant and positive correlation between the scores on the PES-NWI and the JPS (r: 0.65, p < .05). Regression analysis showed that nurses' job performance was affected by five variables (R2 : 59%, p < .05, Durbin-Watson: 2.06). CONCLUSION: The results of the study show that three sub-dimensions of the PES-NWI (nursing foundations for quality of care; staffing and resource adequacy; nurse manager abilities, leadership and support for nurses), colleague solidarity and education level were important factors affecting job performance.

The aim of our study was to develop a new chemo-prophylactic/-therapeutic strategy that effectively prevents COVID-19 and related complications. METHODS: In in vitro studies, COVID-19 infection-sensitive cells were incubated with human oropharyngeal fluids containing high SARS-CoV-2 loads. Levels of infection were determined via intra-cellular virus loads using quantitative PCR (qPCR). Efficacies for infection prevention were determined using several antiviral treatments: lipid-encapsulated ozonized oil (HOO), water-soluble HOO (HOOws), UV, and hydrogen peroxide. In in vivo studies, safety and efficacy of HOO in fighting COVID-19 infection was evaluated in human subjects. RESULTS: HOO in combination with HOOws was the only treatment able to fully neutralize SARS-CoV-2 as well as its capacity to penetrate and reproduce inside sensitive cells. Accordingly, the feasibility of using HOO/HOOws was tested in vivo. Analysis of expired gas in healthy subjects indicates that HOO administration increases oxygen availability in the lung. For our human studies, HOO/HOOws was administered to 52 cancer patients and 21 healthy subjects at high risk for COVID-19 infection, and all of them showed clinical safety. None of them developed COVID-19 infection, although an incidence of at least 11 cases was expected. Efficacy of HOO/HOOws was tested in four COVID-19 patients obtaining recovery and qPCR negativization in less than 10 days. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our experience, the HOO/HOOws treatment can be administered at standard doses (three pills per day) for chemo-prophylactic purposes to healthy subjects for COVID-19 prevention and at high doses (up to eight pills per day) for therapeutic purposes to infected patients. This combined prevention strategy can provide a novel protocol to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.","Izzotti, Alberto; Fracchia, Enzo; Au, William; Colombo, Monica; Pfeffer, Ulrich; Emionite, Laura; Pavan, Simone; Miotto, Daniele; Lova, Paola; Grasselli, Elena; Faelli, Emanuela; Piero, Ruggeri; Tiso, Micaela; Pulliero, Alessandra",,465,25

Osteosarcoma (OS) is one of the most common primary malignant bone tumors. This study aimed to assess the expression and clinical significance of miR-541 in OS patients and explore the biological function of miR-541 in tumor progression. METHODS: Expression of miR-541 was detected by quantitative real-time PCR, and its prognostic value was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The biological function of miR-541 was examined by analyzing its effects on OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Additionally, the underlying potential target of miR-541 was predicated and analyzed. RESULTS: The expression of miR-541 was significantly decreased in OS tissues and cell lines. The deregulated expression of miR-541 in tumor tissues was associated with the overall survival of OS patients and was a potential independent prognostic indicator. In OS cells, the overexpression of miR-541 could inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The luciferase activity results indicated that TGIF2 was a potential target of miR-541. CONCLUSION: The results of this study revealed that the decreased miR-541 expression in OS patients may serve as a prognostic biomarker, and that the overexpression of miR-541 in OS cells results in inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, indicating the potential of miR-541 as a therapeutic target in OS treatment.","Liu, Chunlei; Yi, Xiuling",Diagn Pathol,465,20

High levels of social connection are positively associated with beneficial health outcomes, while social isolation is associated with poor long-term health outcomes including reduced life expectancy. The present study evaluates the impact of social distancing measures during the early period of COVID-19 on substance use behaviors among those in the United States. Methods: We used an internet-based survey with participants (n = 157; 86 male) reporting a history of problems related to drug use. We relied on ANOVA and logistic regression techniques to assess the associations between social connection and substance use. Results: People with more severe drug use problems reported feeling more socially isolated during social distancing. Those who primarily use alcohol reported higher global feelings of social connection than those who primarily use opioids. During social distancing, participants reported an increase in alcohol and cigarette consumption, and a decrease in cocaine use. Lastly, those who reported using drugs for social reasons were less likely to have decreased substance use during social distancing. Conclusions: The current study provides evidence that social distancing guidelines have impacted both substance use behaviors and feelings of social and physical connection. Further, there are differential impacts based on drug of choice. These results advance delineation of the connection between sociality and drug use.","Christie, Nina C; Vojvodic, Vanya; Monterosso, John R",Subst Use Misuse,465,20

A total of 151 cases from Jan. 26 to Mar. 20, 2020, were included. Then we followed 5 steps to predict and evaluate the model: data preprocessing, data splitting, feature selection, model building, prevention of overfitting, and Evaluation, and combined with artificial neural network algorithms. We processed the results in the 5 steps. In feature selection, ALB showed a strong negative correlation (r = 0.771, P < 0.001) whereas GLB (r = 0.661, P < 0.001) and BUN (r = 0.714, P < 0.001) showed a strong positive correlation with severity of COVID-19. TensorFlow was subsequently applied to develop a neural network model. The model achieved good prediction performance, with an area under the curve value of 0.953(0.889-0.982). Our results showed its outstanding performance in prediction. GLB and BUN may be two risk factors for severe COVID-19. Our findings could be of great benefit in the future treatment of patients with COVID-19 and will help to improve the quality of care in the long term. This model has great significance to rationalize early clinical interventions and improve the cure rate.","Kang, Jianhong; Chen, Ting; Luo, Honghe; Luo, Yifeng; Du, Guipeng; Jiming-Yang, Mia",Infect Genet Evol,465,20

Fracture neck of femur (NOF) patients is high-risk surgical patients, often with multiple comorbidities and advanced age. We quantify the 30-day mortality rate in fractured NOF patients with a positive peri-operative COVID-19 antigen test and identify risk factors for increased mortality. METHODS: This is a retrospective multi-centre review of all patients admitted with a fractured NOF and a confirmed laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 between 1 March and 26 April 2020. Demographic data, comorbidities, ASA grade and date of death (if applicable) were collected. RESULTS: There were 64 patients in the cohort with an overall 30-day mortality rate of 32.8% (n = 21). Thirty-five (55%) were female, and mean age was 83 (SD 9, range 46-100) years. There was significantly increased mortality for those with a history of myocardial infarction (p = 0.03). Sixty-four percent of patients underwent surgery within the 36-h target, which is comparable to previous data for the same time of year. Overall mortality increased to 50% (n = 32) at 45 days post-operatively. CONCLUSION: This is a large review of 30-day mortality in NOF patients with concurrent COVID-19 infection. We report a substantial increase from the pre-COVID-19 mean 30-day mortality rate (6.5% in 2019). We highlight the need for counselling patients when presenting with a NOF in relation to peri-operative COVID-19 infection and the associated increased risks.","Dupley, Leanne; Oputa, Tobenna J; Bourne, James T",Eur. j. orthop. surg. traumatol,465,20

The characterization and understanding of the inflammatory metabolic pathways involved into volatile organic compounds (VOCs) production could bring exhaled breath analysis into clinical practice and thus open new therapeutic routes for inflammatory diseases. In this study, lung inflammation was simulated in vitro using A549 epithelial cells. We compared the VOC production from A549 epithelial cells after a chemically induced oxidative stress in vitro, exposing the cells to H2O2, and a biological stress, exposing the cells to an inflammatory pool of sputum supernatants. Special attention was devoted to define proper negative and positive controls (8 different types) for our in vitro models, including healthy sputum co-culture. Sputum from 25 asthmatic and 8 healthy patients were collected to create each pool of supernatants. Each sample type was analyzed in 4 replicates using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography hyphenated to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC×GC-TOFMS). This approach offers high resolving power for complex VOC mixtures. According to the type of inflammation induced, significantly different VOCs were produced by the epithelial cells compared to all controls. For both chemical and biological challenges, an increase of carbonyl compounds (54%) and hydrocarbons (31%) was observed. Interestingly, only the biological inflammation model showed a significant cell proliferation together with an increased VOC production linked to asthma airway inflammation. This study presents a complete GC×GC-TOFMS workflow for in vitro VOC analysis, and its potential to characterize complex lung inflammatory mechanisms.","Zanella, Delphine; Henket, Monique; Schleich, Florence; Dejong, Thibaut; Louis, Renaud; Focant, Jean-François; Stefanuto, Pierre-Hugues",Analyst,465,10

Methods In this retrospective study, we first compared the number of patients who were diagnosed with DR or DME in our clinic during the period of the lockdown and during the same period of the previous year. In addition, we included consecutive patients with DR or DME, who were followed up and treated regularly in our clinic and their appointments deferred due to lockdown, so as to compare the visual acuity, fundoscopy, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings prior to and post lockdown. Results During the lockdown period, there was a statistically significant decrease in patients with DR and DME as compared to the same period in the previous year. Regarding patients with previously diagnosed DME, there was a statistically significant worsening in their visual acuity and central retinal thickness after lockdown as compared to the last visit before lockdown (p&lt;0.001 for both comparisons).

However, gynecological emergencies and malignancies must be addressed despite the restricted resources and the need for protective measures against COVID-19. This study aimed to determine the types of gynecological surgeries performed, difficulties encountered, and their outcomes in the setting of the pandemic. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study over 6 months at a single tertiary center, including 60 women with gynecological complaints, categorized as emergencies and semi-emergencies, who underwent further surgery. Their surgical outcomes were measured through various parameters. Results: We found that 68.3% were emergency cases, while the rest were classified as semi-emergencies. Fibroid and adenomyosis with failed medical management (48.3%), followed by CIN (10%), and malignancies (10%) accounted for the semi-emergency cases, while ruptured ectopic pregnancies (13.3%) and torsion and ovarian cysts (18.4%) comprised the emergency cases. The decision to incision time between emergency and semi-emergency cases varied widely due to the safety prerequisites during the pandemic, ranging from 1 hour in emergency cases to 48 hours in semi-emergency cases. In addition, we studied the ease of preoperative preparation, patient satisfaction, and the average number of personnel available to run the operation theaters at these times.

However, bacterial infections remain a major concern during wound healing and tissue bonding. Hence, the development of bioadhesives with antibacterial properties is necessary. In this study, a hydrogel bioadhesive based on silk fibroin (SF) and tannic acid (TA) was combined with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) generated in situ during hydrogel formation to improve its antibacterial abilities. In this system, TA can be regarded as a phenolic glue molecule to spontaneously co-assemble with SF to fabricate the adhesive matrix network and also as a reductant to induce silver nitrate to form AgNPs evenly within the adhesive network. Furthermore, the influence of the amount of silver nitrate was considered. The produced hybrid hydrogel bioadhesives with different amounts of AgNPs exhibited self-healing capabilities, considerable wet tissue adhesion strengths (14.32 ± 1.85 kPa-28.80 ± 2.29 kPa) and good cytocompatibility. When the initial concentration of silver nitrate was more than 0.05 wt%, the produced STA bioadhesive showed effective antibacterial properties in vitro. These results demonstrate that these STA bioadhesives have the potential to be used in tissue/wound closure, especially when bacterial infections are a main problem.","Ke, Xiang; Dong, Zhiyun; Tang, Shuxian; Chu, Wenlin; Zheng, Xiaoran; Zhen, Li; Chen, Xingyu; Ding, Chunmei; Luo, Jun; Li, Jianshu",Biomater Sci,465,16

METHODS: A narrative report based on the evolution of key published guidelines, systematic reviews and medical policies since the 1940s. RESULTS: Case reports of the value of exercise in cardiac disease can be dated back to 1772. Formative groundwork for exercise-based CR was published between 1940 and 1970. However, it was not until the late 1980s that a large enough data set of controlled trials was available to show significant reductions in premature all-cause and cardiac mortality. Since the mid 1990s, cardiac mortality has been greatly reduced due to enhanced public health, emergency care and more sensitive diagnostic techniques and aggressive treatments. As a result, there appears to be an associated reduced potency of CR to affect mortality. New rationales for why, how and where CR is delivered have emerged including: adapting to a longer surviving ageing multi-morbid population, where healthcare cost savings and quality of life have become increasingly important. CONCLUSIONS: In light of these results, an emerging focus for CR, and in some cases ""pre-habilitation"", is that of a chronic disability management programme increasingly delivered in community and home settings. Within this delivery model, the use of remote personalised technologies is now emerging, especially with new needs accelerated by the pandemic of COVID-19.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONWith continued advances in medical science and better long term survival, the nature of cardiac rehabilitation has evolved over the past eight decades. It was originally an exercise-focused intervention on short term recovery and reducing cardiac and all-cause mortality, to now being one part of a multi-factor lifestyle, behavioural, and medical chronic disease management programme.Throughout history, the important influence of psycho-social well-being and human behaviour has, however, always been of key importance to patients.The location of rehabilitation can now be suited to patient need, both medically and socially, where the same components can be delivered in either a traditional outpatient clinic, community settings, at home and more recently all of these being supported or augmented with the advent of mobile technology.","Buckley, John P",Disabil Rehabil,465,1

As sleep disturbances are a risk factor concerning mental and physical health, prevention and early intervention are necessary. Thus, the aim of this study was to implement a self-learning prevention and early intervention training for university staff members. We adapted an established cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) intervention as an online version for use during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) crisis. Methods: Development and adaptation procedure of the internet-based CBT­I (iCBT-I) prevention and early intervention training is described. Sessions and topics are shown in detail. The Online Sleep Prevention and Treatment Acceptance questionnaire (OSTA) and the Online Sleep Prevention and Treatment Feedback questionnaire (OSTF) were used to assess acceptance. Sleep problems of university staff members were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Questionnaire (PSQI). Results: The online-adapted version consisted of seven modules. Contents of sessions and topics were implemented based on video clips. Drawings were added to information regarding sleep and sleep hygiene as well as addressing stress and cognitions. In all, 15 individuals participated in this pilot study. The new iCBT­I self-learning prevention training was well accepted.

The widespread use of these devices and the long-term nature of the recorded data provides a valuable source of physical activity data for epidemiological research. The challenges include the large heterogeneity between activity tracker models in terms of available data types, the accuracy of recorded data, and how this data can be shared between different providers and third-party systems. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop a system to record data on physical activity from different providers of consumer-based activity trackers and to examine its usability as a tool for physical activity monitoring in epidemiological research. The longitudinal nature of the data and the concurrent pandemic outbreak allowed us to show how the system can be used for surveillance of physical activity levels before, during, and after a COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: We developed a system (mSpider) for automatic recording of data on physical activity from participants wearing activity trackers from Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, Oura, Polar, Samsung, and Withings, as well as trackers storing data in Google Fit and Apple Health. To test the system throughout development, we recruited 35 volunteers to wear a provided activity tracker from early 2019 and onward. In addition, we recruited 113 participants with privately owned activity trackers worn before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown in Norway. We examined monthly changes in the number of steps, minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and activity energy expenditure between 2019 and 2020 using bar plots and two-sided paired sample t tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. RESULTS: Compared to March 2019, there was a significant reduction in mean step count and mean activity energy expenditure during the March 2020 lockdown period. The reduction in steps and activity energy expenditure was temporary, and the following monthly comparisons showed no significant change between 2019 and 2020. A small significant increase in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was observed for several monthly comparisons after the lockdown period and when comparing March-December 2019 with March-December 2020. CONCLUSIONS: mSpider is a working prototype currently able to record physical activity data from providers of consumer-based activity trackers. The system was successfully used to examine changes in physical activity levels during the COVID-19 period.","Henriksen, André; Johannessen, Erlend; Hartvigsen, Gunnar; Grimsgaard, Sameline; Hopstock, Laila Arnesdatter",JMIR Public Health Surveill,465,1

The ample research on fitness of environment has been proved that the strict imposition of lockdown was the blessings of environment. The river Damodar has historical significance and lifeline for huge population of Jharkhand and West Bengal state of India but in the recent years the water quality has been deteriorated due to untreated industrial effluents and urban sewage. The main objective of this study is to examine the water quality of river Damodar during and prelockdown phase for domestic use and restoration of river ecosystem. A total of eleven (11) effluent discharge sites were selected in prelockdown and during lockdown phase. A new approach of water quality assessment, i.e., water pollution index (WPI) has been applied in this study. WPI is weightage free, unbiased method to analysis of water quality. The result shows that the physical, chemical and heavy elements were found beyond the standard limit in prelockdown period. The cation and anion were arranged in an order of Na2+ > K+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ and Cl- > So4 - > No3 - > F- in both the sessions. WPI of prelockdown showed that about 100% water samples are of highly polluted. WPI of lockdown period showed that around 90.90% samples improved to 'good quality' and 9.10% of samples are of 'moderately polluted.' Hypothesis testing by 't' test proved that there was a significant difference (&#961; = 0.05%) in values of each parameter between two periods. Null hypothesis was rejected and indicated the improvement of river water quality statistically. Spatial mapping using Arc GIS 10.4 interpolation (IDW) helps to understand spatial intensity of pollution load in two periods. This research study should be helpful for further management and spatial diagnosis of water resource of river Damodar.","Chakraborty, Baisakhi; Roy, Sambhunath; Bera, Amit; Adhikary, Partha Pratim; Bera, Biswajit; Sengupta, Debashish; Bhunia, Gouri Sankar; Shit, Pravat Kumar",Environ Dev Sustain,465,1

A lack of effective methods for screening potential patients, rapidly diagnosing suspected cases, and accurately monitoring of the epidemic in real time to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19 raises significant difficulties in mitigating the epidemic in many countries. As effective point-of-care diagnosis tools, simple, low-cost and rapid sensors have the potential to greatly accelerate the screening and diagnosis of suspected patients to improve their treatment and care. In particular, there is evidence that multiple pathogens have been detected in sewage, including SARS-CoV-2, providing significant opportunities for the development of advanced sensors for wastewater-based epidemiology that provide an early warning of the pandemic within the population. Sensors could be used to screen potential carriers, provide real-time monitoring and control of the epidemic, and even support targeted drug screening and delivery within the integration of emerging mobile health (mHealth) technology. In this communication, we discuss the feasibility of an integrated point-of-care biosensor system with mobile health for wastewater-based epidemiology (iBMW) for early warning of COVID-19, screening and diagnosis of potential infectors, and improving health care and public health.

Many HIV clinics share staff and logistics with infectious disease facilities, which are now on the frontline in tackling COVID-19. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of the current pandemic situation on HIV care and continuity of antiretroviral treatment (ART) supplies in CEE countries. METHODS: The Euroguidelines in Central and Eastern Europe (ECEE) Network Group was established in February 2016 to review standards of care for HIV in the region. The group consists of professionals actively involved in HIV care. On March 19, 2020 we decided to review the status of HIV care sustainability in the face of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Europe. For this purpose, we constructed an online survey consisting of 23 questions. Respondents were recruited from ECEE members in 22 countries, based on their involvement in HIV care, and contacted via email. RESULTS: In total, 19 countries responded: Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Macedonia, Poland, Republic of Moldova, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine. Most of the respondents were infectious disease physicians directly involved in HIV care (17/19). No country reported HIV clinic closures. HIV clinics were operating normally in only six countries (31.6%). In 11 countries (57.9%) physicians were sharing HIV and COVID-19 care duties. None of the countries expected shortage of ART in the following 2 weeks; however, five physicians expressed uncertainty about the following 2 months. At the time of providing responses, ten countries (52.6%) had HIV-positive persons under quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: A shortage of resources is evident, with an impact on HIV care inevitable. We need to prepare to operate with minimal medical resources, with the aim of securing constant supplies of ART. Non-governmental organizations should re-evaluate their earlier objectives and support efforts to ensure continuity of ART delivery.","Kowalska, J D; Skrzat-Klapaczynska, A; Bursa, D; Balayan, T; Begovac, J; Chkhartishvili, N; Gokengin, D; Harxhi, A; Jilich, D; Jevtovic, D; Kase, K; Lakatos, B; Matulionyte, R; Mulabdic, V; Nagit, A; Papadopoulos, A; Stefanovic, M; Vassilenko, A; Vasylyev, M; Yancheva, N; Yurin, O; Horban, A",Int J Infect Dis,465,6

While theoretically effective, this policy places a substantial social and economic burden on both the individual and wider society, which might result in low adherence and reduced policy effectiveness. We aimed to assess the merit of testing contacts to avert onward transmission and to replace or reduce the length of quarantine for uninfected contacts. METHODS: We used an agent-based model to simulate the viral load dynamics of exposed contacts, and their potential for onward transmission in different quarantine and testing strategies. We compared the performance of quarantines of differing durations, testing with either PCR or lateral flow antigen (LFA) tests at the end of quarantine, and daily LFA testing without quarantine, against the current 14-day quarantine strategy. We also investigated the effect of contact tracing delays and adherence to both quarantine and self-isolation on the effectiveness of each strategy. FINDINGS: Assuming moderate levels of adherence to quarantine and self-isolation, self-isolation on symptom onset alone can prevent 37% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 12-56) of onward transmission potential from secondary cases. 14 days of post-exposure quarantine reduces transmission by 59% (95% UI 28-79). Quarantine with release after a negative PCR test 7 days after exposure might avert a similar proportion (54%, 95% UI 31-81; risk ratio [RR] 0·94, 95% UI 0·62-1·24) to that of the 14-day quarantine period, as would quarantine with a negative LFA test 7 days after exposure (50%, 95% UI 28-77; RR 0·88, 0·66-1·11) or daily testing without quarantine for 5 days after tracing (50%, 95% UI 23-81; RR 0·88, 0·60-1·43) if all tests are returned negative. A stronger effect might be possible if individuals isolate more strictly after a positive test and if contacts can be notified faster. INTERPRETATION: Testing might allow for a substantial reduction in the length of, or replacement of, quarantine with a small excess in transmission risk. Decreasing test and trace delays and increasing adherence will further increase the effectiveness of these strategies. Further research is required to empirically evaluate the potential costs (increased transmission risk, false reassurance) and benefits (reduction in the burden of quarantine, increased adherence) of such strategies before adoption as policy.

DNA sequence polymorphisms representing alternate alleles at gRNA target sites may confer a drive-resistant phenotype in individuals carrying them. Modeling predicts that, for observed levels of SGV at potential target sites and observed rates of de novo DRA formation, population modification strategies are uniquely resilient to DRAs. We conclude that gene drives can succeed when fitness costs incurred by drive-carrying mosquitoes are low enough to prevent strong positive selection for DRAs produced de novo or as part of the SGV and that population modification strategies are less prone to failure due to drive resistance.","Lanzaro, Gregory C; Sánchez C, Hector M; Collier, Travis C; Marshall, John M; James, Anthony A",Bioessays,465,23

However, the rapid development of SCF leads to more complex credit risks. How to effectively discriminate and manage SMEs to reduce credit risk has become one of the most critical issues in SCF. In addition, sustainable SCF (SSCF) has received increasing attention, and credit risk management is important to achieve SSCF. Therefore, it is significant to identify the key factors influencing the credit risk of SMEs and construct a prediction model to promote SSCF. This study uses the lasso-logistic model to identify factors influencing the credit risk of SMEs and to predict the credit risk of SMEs. The empirical results show that (i) the key factors influencing SMEs’ credit risk include six variables—the matching degree of order data, ratio of contract enforcement, number of contract defaults, degree of business concentration, and number of administrative penalties;and (ii) the lasso-logistic model can identify the key factors influencing credit risk and have a better prediction performance. Moreover, transaction credit and reputation supervision significantly influence the credit risk of SMEs.","Yang, Yubin Chu Xuejian Liu Feng Yang Peifang",Sustainability,465,10

The integration of antimicrobial and hydrophobic catheter materials, and pressure-activated valves, into polyurethane PICCs are innovations designed to prevent infective and/or thrombotic complications. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multicentre, parallel group, superiority randomised controlled trial with two experimental arms ((1) hydrophobic PICC (with pressure-activated valve); (2) chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated PICC (with external clamp)) and one control group ((3) conventional polyurethane PICC (with external clamp)). Recruitment of 1098 adult and paediatric patients will take place over 2 years at three tertiary-referral hospitals in Queensland, Australia. Patients are eligible for inclusion if their PICC is to be inserted for medical treatment, with a vascular size sufficient to support a 4-Fr PICC or larger, and with informed consent. The primary outcome is PICC failure, a composite of thrombotic (venous thrombosis, breakage and occlusion) and infective complications (PICC-associated bloodstream infection and local infection). Secondary outcomes include: all-cause PICC complication; thrombotic complications; infective complications; adverse events (local or systemic reaction); PICC dwell time; patient/parent satisfaction; and healthcare costs.

Habitat loss, the creation of artificial environments, the manipulation and trade of wild animals and more generally the destruction of biodiversity are mainly affecting the dynamic balance of the biosphere, as is confirmed by the first world report on the world’s ecosystems, i.e. the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. The changes in the use of land and the destruction of natural habitats, such as tropical forests, may be the main origin of more than half of emergent zoonosis. Given the magnitude of the current health crisis and the potential of pandemic risks, the world needs to pay attention to climate change and the broader sustainability agenda at this time. As the current health crisis is turning worldwide interest on climate change there is an urgent need to assess the response to COVID-19 from the financial and insurance perspective. In doing this our analysis points out the relationship between pandemic risk and sustainable development by considering both negative and positive impacts on the achievement of the SDG 13 targets. The ongoing COVID-19 shows the urgent need to strengthen sustainability by reducing and managing climate and environmental risks that can be supported by radical solutions provided by sustainable finance, as the European Commission emphasized in its consultation on Renewed Sustainable Finance Strategy. From the insurance industry view, it is clear that potential actions will be needed to limit the impacts of extreme weather events and related effects on global supply chain. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Doni, F.; Johannsdottir, L.",World Sustainability Series,465,20

OBJECTIVE: We review the current evidence on hypoxemia in COVID-19 and place it in the context of known evidence-based management of hypoxemic respiratory failure in the emergency department. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 causes mortality primarily through the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with hypoxemia arising from shunt, a mismatch of ventilation and perfusion. Management of patients developing ARDS should focus on mitigating derecruitment and avoiding volutrauma or barotrauma. CONCLUSIONS: High flow nasal cannula and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation have a more limited role in COVID-19 because of the risk of aerosolization and minimal benefit in severe cases, but can be considered. Stable patients who can tolerate repositioning should be placed in a prone position while awake. Once intubated, patients should be managed with ventilation strategies appropriate for ARDS, including targeting lung-protective volumes and low pressures. Increasing positive end-expiratory pressure can be beneficial. Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators do not decrease mortality but may be given to improve refractory hypoxemia. Prone positioning of intubated patients is associated with a mortality reduction in ARDS and can be considered for patients with persistent hypoxemia. Neuromuscular blockade should also be administered in patients who remain dyssynchronous with the ventilator despite adequate sedation. Finally, patients with refractory severe hypoxemic respiratory failure in COVID-19 should be considered for venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.","Wilcox, Susan R; Condella, Anna",J. emerg. med,465,24

If left unchecked, these outbreaks can easily spill over the prison walls to threaten the general public. Moreover, these risks are heightened by preexisting environmental conditions, especially overcrowding. It is thus paramount to establish effective protocols for prevention, early detection and outbreak management. The purpose of this article is to document a strategy that been at least partially successful in reducing the damage that could potentially be caused by a sustained SARS-CoV-2 outbreak within a correctional facility. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The authors conducted a retrospective analysis on patients' and health-care workers' medical records to obtain demographic and clinical information. Descriptive data analysis was then carried out. FINDINGS: In total, the authors tested 453 people with oropharyngeal swabs from March 15, 2020, to June 30, 2020. Of these people, 58 were positive and 395 were negative, with a prevalence of 12.8%.Of the 453 patients, 60 were health workers: 24 tested positive for SARS-CoV2 ribonucleic acid (RNA); 18 developed symptoms; and three needed hospitalization.Among patients in detention, 34 resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Two were hospitalized and later died. Both had severe preexisting conditions; they were aged 76 and 59 years old, respectively. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: In this study, the authors describe the design and effective implementation of prevention and containment measures against SARS-CoV-2 within the walls of a correctional facility. The authors describe how they rapidly created clean confinement sections to isolate cases in an environment designed for security at the expense of virus containment and how educational efforts have played a vital role in their strategy.","Cerrato, Ferdinando; Esposito, Michele; Drusiani, Agnese; Moi, Iuri; Franciosi, Eugenia; Assueri, Nadialina; Campalastri, Raffaella; Fioritti, Angelo",International journal of prisoner health (Online),465,24

It is essential to use various data to analyze and predict the level of aviation safety. This paper used a combined prediction model based on Induced Ordered Weighted Averaging (IOWA) operator to forecast the civil aviation incident rate. We compiled and calculated civil aviation incident data and total flight hours from 2008 to 2019 in China and took the civil aviation incident rate (incident numbers per ten thousand flight hours) as the prediction object. First, this paper used the nonlinear regression model, Grey Verhulst model, and Holt-Winters exponential smoothing model to forecast the civil aviation incident rate individually. Then, it used the smallest sum of squared errors as the principle to use a combined prediction model based on the IOWA operator. It can be seen from the experimental results that the prediction accuracy of the combined model is better than single models. Finally, this paper forecasted the civil aviation incident rate in 2020 and 2021. The results showed that the predicted rates are 0.524 and 0.551. Most notably the incident rate will increase significantly compared with 2019.","Sun, Yixiang Geng Nana",Journal of Advanced Transportation,465,16

Recent bioinformatics evidence suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2-the main cell entry target of SARS-CoV-2-was predominantly enriched in spermatogonia, Leydig and Sertoli cells, which suggests the potential vulnerability of the male reproductive system to SARS-CoV-2 infection. OBJECTIVES: To identify SARS-CoV-2 RNA in seminal plasma and to determine semen characteristics from male patients in the acute and recovery phases of infection. METHODS: From February 26 to April 2, 2020, 23 male patients with COVID-19 were recruited. The clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography scans of all patients were recorded in detail. We also investigated semen characteristics and the viral RNA load in semen from these patients in the acute and recovery phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection using approved methods. RESULTS: The age range of the 23 patients was 20-62 years. All patients tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in semen specimens. Among them, the virus had been cleared in 11 patients, as they tested negative. The remaining 12 patients tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in semen samples, but were positive in sputum and fecal specimens. The median interval from diagnosis to providing semen samples was 32 days, when total sperm counts, total motile sperm counts, and sperm morphology of the patients were within normal ranges. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In this cohort of patients with a recent infection or recovering from COVID-19, there was no SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in semen samples, which indicates the unlikely possibility of sexual transmission through semen at about 1 month after first detection.","Guo, Liqiang; Zhao, Shengtian; Li, Weiguang; Wang, Yong; Li, Leping; Jiang, Shujuan; Ren, Wanhua; Yuan, Qun; Zhang, Fubin; Kong, Feng; Lei, Jie; Yuan, Mingzhen",Androl.

Thus, to better guide decisions in these circumstances, in this article we argue that there is a need to follow fundamental principles in order to guide best public health practices. We purpose the usefulness of the framework of principalism in public which has been proved useful in real life conditions as a guide in the absence of reliable evidence.

RESULTS: Results:The analysis results indicate that under pandemic conditions informational space of Ukraine is charging with low-quality and diverse information and is getting out of control, which entails adverse effects on societal resilience. Besides, a survey conducted by the SSU Center for Social Studies endorses the availability of communication gaps. The poll claims 38.6% of Ukrainians to be dissatisfied with their awareness level of Covid-19 because the information is contradictory and unreliable. The opinion poll also proves the low level of Ukrainians' trust in state institutions and official details on the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, violations of quarantine restrictions are socially acceptable, and a significant part of the population tends to ignore such violations by others. That is, among Ukrainians, compliance with quarantine restrictions has not become a social norm. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: An essential component for molding social resilience is the development and adoption of communication policies to change human behavior in the long-term in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government should also develop a Public Health Awareness Concept in the pandemic with appropriate implementation plans at the state, regional and territorial community levels.","Kostenko, A.

These potentially deadly infections are further exacerbated due to the growing incidence of antimicrobial resistance. To combat these infections there is a need to better understand immune mechanisms that promote microbial clearance. This need in the context of lung infections has been further heightened with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are a recently discovered tissue resident innate immune cell found at mucosal sites that respond rapidly in the event of an infection. ILC3s have clear roles in regulating mucosal immunity and tissue homeostasis in the intestine, though the immunological functions in lungs remain unclear. It has been demonstrated in both viral and bacterial pneumonia that stimulated ILC3s secrete the cytokines IL-17 and IL-22 to promote both microbial clearance as well as tissue repair. In this review, we will evaluate regulation of ILC3s during inflammation and discuss recent studies that examine ILC3 function in the context of both bacterial and viral pulmonary infections.","Hoffmann, Joseph P; Kolls, Jay K; McCombs, Janet E",Front Immunol,465,29

With the advent of remote learning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the school moved its admissions process, including the multiple mini-interview (MMI), from an in-person to online format in mid-March 2020. APPROACH: The UH COM selected Zoom as the video conferencing platform for its virtual admissions process, including the MMI. On each interview day (3-4 hours), 14-16 applicants joined administrators, faculty, and staff in a virtual meeting room. Applicants were divided into two groups: one viewed short presentations about the school, curriculum, and departments, while the other participated in 7 MMI stations (one-on-one interactions with interviewers) via virtual breakout rooms; the groups then switched. The MMI stations were the same as those used in person in early March. Applicants were able to ask questions at multiple points during the day. Technical support was provided for participants with connectivity issues or unfamiliar with Zoom. OUTCOMES: Of the 180 applicants interviewed in March-April 2020, 134 (74%) participated in the virtual process and 46 (26%) in the on-site process. Twenty-five (83%) of the 30 members of the inaugural class of 2025 interviewed virtually. Advantages of the virtual format included ease of access for faculty and more flexibility and less expense for applicants. Challenges included the need for applicants to decide whether to accept an offer of admission from a new school without visiting and missed opportunities for faculty to have relatively unstructured interactions with applicants. NEXT STEPS: This virtual admissions process was a feasible alternative for the inaugural class but is not sustainable. The UH COM plans to leverage lessons learned to refine the virtual format for use in future admissions cycles, even when in-person interviews are possible.","Carroll Turpin, Michelle A; Steele, Kenya; Matuk-Villazon, Omar; Rowland, Kevin; Dayton, Catherine; Horn, Kathryn",Acad. med,465,30

Since, no specific antiviral drug is proven effective for treatment against COVID-19, identification of new therapeutics is an urgent need. In this study, flavonoid compounds were analyzed for its inhibitory potential against important protein targets of SARS-CoV-2 using computational approaches. Virtual docking was performed for screening of flavonoid compounds retrieved from PubChem against the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 using COVID-19 docking server. The cut off of dock score was set to >-9kcal/mol and screened compounds were individually docked against main protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and spike proteins using AutoDock 4.1 software. Finally, lead flavonoid compounds were subjected to ADMET analysis. A total of 458 flavonoid compounds were virtually screened against main protease target and 36 compounds were selected based on the interaction energy value >-9kcal/mol. Furthermore, these compounds were individually docked against protein targets and top 10 lead compounds were identified. Among the lead compounds, agathisflavone showed highest binding energy value of -8.4 kcal/mol against main protease, Albireodelphin showed highest dock score of -9.8 kcal/mol and -11.2 kcal/mol against RdRp, and spike proteins, respectively. Based on the high dock score and ADMET properties, top 5 lead molecules such as Albireodelphin, Apigenin 7-(6''-malonylglucoside), Cyanidin-3-(p-coumaroyl)-rutinoside-5-glucoside, Delphinidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside 5-O-(6-coumaroyl-beta-D-glucoside) and (-)-Maackiain-3-O-glucosyl-6''-O-malonate were identified as potent inhibitors against main protease, RdRp, and spike protein targets of SARS-CoV-2.

This systematic review aims to stratify studies as high or low risk of bias to determine the true sensitivity of CT for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection according to the unbiased (low risk) studies, a topic of particular importance given the insufficient quantity of RT-PCR kits in many countries. We focus on sensitivity as that is the chief advantage perceived of CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This systematic review involved searching the PubMed and Google Scholar databases for articles conducted and published between January 1 and April 15, 2020. The quality assessment tool QUADAS-2 was used to stratify studies according to their risk of bias, and exclusion criteria included not providing the information deemed relevant for such a stratification, such as not indicating if the patients were symptomatic or asymptomatic, or identifying the source of the specimen for the reference standard, RT-PCR (eg, nasal, oropharyngeal, etc). Sensitivity values were then extracted, and random effects meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of 641 search results, 37 studies (n = 9610 patients) were included in the analysis. The mean sensitivity of RT-PCR for COVID-19 reported by the biased studies was 70% (n = 5409/7 studies; 95% confidence interval [CI], 43-97; I = 99.1%), compared with 78% by unbiased studies (n = 534/4 studies; 95% CI, 69-87, I = 89.9%). For chest CT, the mean sensitivity reported by biased studies was 94% (n = 3371 patients/24 studies; 95% CI, 92-96; I = 93.1%), compared with 75% by unbiased studies (n = 957/10 studies; 95% CI, 67-83; I = 89.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The difference between the sensitivities of CT and RT-PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection is lower than previously thought, as after stratifying the studies, the true sensitivity for CT based on the unbiased studies is limited.","Waller, Joseph V; Allen, Isabel E; Lin, Keldon K; Diaz, Michael J; Henry, Travis S; Hope, Michael D",Invest Radiol,465,4

Therefore, rapid diagnosis in conjunction with infection prevention measures is important to prevent transmission of the diseases. Recently, a new Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV (Xpert 4-in-1) assay enables the detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2, flu A, flu B, and RSV in upper respiratory tract specimens. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the Xpert 4-in-1 assay by comparing it with that of the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV assays for the detection of the four viruses in nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens. A total of 279 NP specimens, including 66, 56, 64, and 53 specimens positive for SARS-CoV-2, flu A, flu B, and RSV, respectively, were included. The Xpert 4-in-1 assay demonstrated high concordance with the comparator assays, with overall agreement for SARS-CoV-2, flu A, flu B, and RSV at 99.64%, 100%, 99.64%, and 100%, respectively, and a high Cohen's kappa (&#954;) value ranging from 0.99 to 1.00, indicating an almost perfect correlation between assays. The cycle threshold value association between positive samples also showed a good correlation between assays. In conclusion, the overall performance of the Xpert 4-in-1 assay was highly comparable to that of the Xpert SARS-CoV-2 and Xpert Flu/RSV assays for the detection and differentiation of SARS CoV-2, flu A, flu B, and RSV in NP specimens.","Leung, Eddie Chi-Man; Chow, Viola Chi-Ying; Lee, May Kin-Ping; Tang, Kevin Pui-San; Li, Daniel Kwok-Cheung; Lai, Raymond Wai-Man",J. clin. microbiol,465,21

We aimed to study the epidemiology, clinical features and short-term outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. METHODS: We performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital, including 55 severe patients and 166 non-severe patients, from January 2, 2020 to February 10, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 221 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea. On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia. In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications. As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died. 80% of severe cases received ICU (intensive care unit) care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with elder age, chronic comorbidities, blood leukocyte/lymphocyte count, procalcitonin level, co-infection and severe complications might increase the risk of poor clinical outcomes.","Zhang, Guqin; Hu, Chang; Luo, Linjie; Fang, Fang; Chen, Yongfeng; Li, Jianguo; Peng, Zhiyong; Pan, Huaqin",J Clin Virol,465,16

Here, we have successfully synthesized hierarchical structures (Ni3B/Ni(BO2)2@NixCoyMoO4) by boronizing NixCoyMoO4 nanosheets on flexible carbon cloth substrates. Benefitting from the synergistic effect among Ni3B, Ni(BO2)2 and NixCoyMoO4 in hybrid architectures, the electrode material possesses higher capacity of 394.7 mA h g-1 at 1 A g-1 and a good rate performance (309.5 mA h g-1 maintained at 20 A g-1). Then, a hybrid supercapacitor assembled with Ni3B/Ni(BO2)2@NixCoyMoO4 and activated carbon as the positive and the negative electrode, displays a high specific capacitance of 370.7 F g-1 at 1 A g-1 (210 F g-1 at 10 A g-1), a high voltage of 1.7 V, and a high energy density of 131.8 W h kg-1 at the power density of 800 W kg-1 (still 74.7 W h kg-1 maintained at 8000 W kg-1).

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) units have been forced to change their practices to address the disease and to ensure the quality of care. METHODS: We conducted a national survey among IBD gastroenterologist members of the Spanish Working Group on Crohn's Disease and Colitis regarding changes of practice, IBD treatments, and diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19. RESULTS: We received 54 answers from Spanish hospitals. One hundred percent of the IBD units rescheduled onsite visits to telematic consultation, and elective endoscopic and surgical procedures were delayed. Protective measures were also taken in the infusion units (100% of health centers) and hospital pharmacies, with 40.7% sending subcutaneous medications to patients. No switching between intravenous and subcutaneous anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs were made. We also found that 96.1% of IBD units advised their patients to maintain treatment if they were asymptomatic for COVID-19. For patients with COVID-19 symptoms, 92.6% of IBD units referred them to primary care or the emergency department. In addition, 7.5% of IBD units made a COVID-19 diagnosis through polymerase chain reaction and/or chest x-ray.Modifications in IBD treatment and treatment recommended for COVID-19 are also discussed.

The study's context is Nigeria's banking, manufacturing and healthcare sectors, which have a history of high employee stress levels. Design/methodology/approach Using a qualitative, interpretive methodology, the study adopts the thematic analysis process (TAP) to draw and analyse data from semi-structured telephone interviews with 10 banking, 11 manufacturing and 9 frontline healthcare workers in Nigeria. Findings It was found that a compassionate managerial leadership can drive a considerate response to employees' ""fear of job (in)security"", ""healthcare risk"" and concerns about ""work overload, underpayment and delayed payment"", which respondents considered to be some of the key causes of increased stress among employees during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Research limitations/implications The study is limited to exploring the relationship between compassionate managerial leadership and an organisation's ability to manage employee stress in the COVID-19 situation, using 30 samples from organisations operating in three Nigerian cities and sectors. Future studies may involve more Nigerian cities, sectors and samples. It may also possibly include quantitative combination to allow generalisation of findings. Practical implications In order to survive in extreme situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, organisations are forced to take drastic and often managerialist-driven work measures which can trigger high stress levels, low productivity and absenteeism among employees. Hence, organisations would benefit from implementing compassion-driven policies that are more inclusive and responsive to the workplace stressors facing employees. Originality/value Employee stress has been widely explored in many areas, including definitions, stressors, strains, possible interventions and coping strategies. There remains, however, a dearth of scholarship on how management-leadership compassion can help to reduce employee stress levels in extreme conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic - particularly in emerging economies.","Oruh, E.

The national government enforced an “enhanced community quarantine (ECQ)” that restricted the movement of the population. The Philippine General Hospital (PGH), a tertiary government hospital, was designated as one of three COVID-19 referral centers in the capital. These curtailed the delivery of services offered to non-COVID-19 cases, such as malignancy. Cancer management, however, should remain a priority as any delay would potentially cause disease progression. For locally-advanced, non-metastatic rectal cancer, neoadjuvant therapy may be given for specific indications. At the PGH, long-course chemoradiotherapy (LCCRT) followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy is the often-employed regimen for patients with stage II-III rectal cancer. Methods/Interventions: This was an observational single cohort study that included all patients with non-metastatic rectal cancer who were managed at the PGH from March 16 to May 31, 2020, coinciding with the lockdown. The management received, including modifications;and their outcomes were investigated. Results/Outcome(s): Of the 52 patients included-majority were female (58%), belonging to the 50-69 years age group (54%), and residing outside the capital (60%). On following-up them up, 13 (25%) had no disease progression, 8 (15%) had local progression, 15 (29%) had metastatic progression, 10 (19%) have died, and 6 (12%) were lost to follow-up. Among those with non-metastatic disease, 2 were to undergo outright resection, but 1 decided to have her surgery done in her locality. The remaining 19 required neoadjuvant therapy-9 LCCRT, 5 LCCRT with chemotherapy, 2 short-course radiotherapy with chemotherapy (RAPIDO), 3 neoadjuvant chemotherapy. As of writing, 8 have completed their neoadjuvant treatment, 8 are undergoing treatment, 2 had their treatment interrupted, and 1 has yet to begin treatment. No treatment-associated complication was reported. The initial plan for 10 patients, as agreed upon by a multidisciplinary team, was changed. Among those who completed neoadjuvant therapy (9 patients), only 1 was able to undergo resection on time. The rest were delayed, with a median time of 4 months. One had postoperative complications (i.e. ileus and superficial surgical site infection). One has repeatedly failed to arrive for her surgery. There was one adjuvant chemotherapy- related mortality. Conclusions/Discussion: Delays in rectal cancer management due to the pandemic resulted in disease progression in several patients. Alternative neoadjuvant treatment options based on sound evidence should be considered, while taking into account oncologic outcomes, acceptable toxicity, and limitation of potential COVID-19 exposure. Investigating the long-term effects of these management principles in a larger population may provide data that support the applicability of these regimens in our setting.","Manlubatan, S.

This is true for semiconducting nanostructures as well as for plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs). Indeed, improvement of photocatalytic efficiencies by combining semiconductor and plasmonic nanostructures is one of the reasons why their ultrafast dynamics are intensively studied. In this work, we will review our activity on ultrafast spectroscopy in nanostructures carried out in the recently established EuroFEL Support Laboratory. We have investigated the dynamical plasmonic responses of metal NPs both in solution and in 2D and 3D arrays on surfaces, with particular attention being paid to the effects of the nanoparticle shape and to the conversion of absorbed light into heat on a nano-localized scale. We will summarize the results obtained on the carrier dynamics in nanostructured perovskites with emphasis on the hot-carrier dynamics and in semiconductor nanosystems such as ZnSe and Si nanowires, with particular attention to the band-gap bleaching dynamics. Subsequently, the study of semiconductor-metal NP hybrids, such as CeO$_2$-Ag NPs, ZnSe-Ag NPs and ZnSe-Au NPs, allows the discussion of interaction mechanisms such as charge carrier transfer and F{\""o}rster interaction.

In this study, we explored COVID-19 testing and the impact of the pandemic among participants from the Miami Adult Studies on HIV cohort, predominantly composed of lowincome minorities living with and without HIV. Methods: Between July and August 2020, a telephone survey was administered to 299 Miami Adult Studies on HIV participants to assess COVID-19 testing, prevention behaviors, and psychosocial stressors. Health care utilization, antiretroviral adherence, food insecurity, and substance use during the pandemic were compared with those of their last cohort visit (7.8 6 2.9 months earlier). Results: Half of surveyed participants had been tested for COVID-19, 8 had tested positive and 2 had been hospitalized. PLWH (n = 183) were 42% times less likely than HIV-uninfected participants to have been tested. However, after adjustment for age, employment, COVID-19 symptoms, mental health care, and substance use, the effect of HIV status was no longer significant. PLWH were more likely to have seen a health care provider, use face coverings, and avoid public transportation and less likely to be food insecure and drink hazardously. There were significant changes in substance use patterns during the pandemic when compared with those before. Conclusion: PLWH, compared with their HIV-uninfected peers, were more likely to engage in preventive measures and health care during the pandemic, potentially reducing their exposure to COVID-19. There were no reported changes in antiretroviral adherence or health care utilization, but there were changes in substance use;these need to be monitored as this crisis progresses.

It has exposed unexpected cardiovascular vulnerabilities at all stages of the disease (pre-infection, acute phase and subsequent chronic phase). The major cardiometabolic drivers identified to have epidemiological and mechanistic associations with COVID-19 are abnormal adiposity, dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Hypertension is of particular interest, because components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which are critically involved in the pathophysiology of hypertension, are also implicated in COVID-19. Specifically ACE2, a multifunctional protein of the RAS, which is part of the protective axis of the RAS, is also the receptor through which SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells causing viral infection. Cardiovascular and cardiometabolic co-morbidities not only predispose to COVID-19, but are complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, increasing evidence indicates that acute kidney injury is common in COVID-19, that it occurs early and in temporal association with respiratory failure and is associated with poor prognosis, especially in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. Here we discuss cardiovascular and kidney disease in the context of COVID-19 and provide recent advances on putative pathophysiological mechanisms linking cardiovascular disease and COVID-19, focusing on the RAS and ACE2 as well as the immune system and inflammation. We provide up-to-date information on the relationship between hypertension, diabetes, and COVID-19 and emphasize the major cardiovascular diseases associated with COVID-19.

Twenty COVID-19 patients received two 200 ml transfusions of convalescent patient CP over 24-h compared with 20 who received standard of care. The primary outcome was the requirement for ventilation (non-invasive or mechanical ventilation). The secondary outcomes were biochemical parameters and mortality at 28 days. The CP group were a higher risk group with higher ferritin levels (p < 0.05) though respiratory indices did not differ. The primary outcome measure was required in 6 controls and 4 patients on CP (risk ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.22-2.0, p = 0.72); mean time on ventilation (NIV or MV) did not differ.

Travel has been restricted, economies slashed, borders sealed, and billions quarantined at their residences, in an attempt to contain the outbreak. Social distancing and lockdown measures have disrupted human lives in terms of social relationships and emotional bonds. Every individual is facing unique challenges to cope with these unprecedented times. However, certain sections of the population, like the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) community, are particularly vulnerable to not only the infective risks of the virus, but also the psycho-social offshoots of the global lockdown and the pandemic aftermath. The various factors range from the immunocompromised state, increased comorbidities of sexually transmitted diseases, other chronic medical disorders and substance abuse, as well as reduced access to health care, to stigma and social discrimination, administrative apathy, economic constraints, and uncertainty of social rituals like the Pride Celebrations. These can lead to the underdetection of the viral load, increased physiological risks to COVID-19, decreased help-seeking, and inequality in health and legal care. Their emotional and psychosexual well-being also gets impaired, with increased risks for psychiatric disorders and suicidality. Keeping these factors in the background, this article glances at the disproportionate risk related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the sexual minorities, explores the psycho-social factors behind the same, and highlights specific ways to mitigate these risks for better care. Adopting a rights-based perspective for the LGBTQ community through public health measures during such crises can help reduce stigma and promote their social inclusion.","Banerjee, Debanjan; Nair, Vasundharaa S.",J.

The guidance supports immediate post-partum mother-infant contact and breastfeeding with appropriate respiratory precautions. Although many countries have followed WHO guidance, others have implemented infection prevention and control (IPC) policies that impose varying levels of post-partum separation and discourage or prohibit breastfeeding or provision of expressed breast milk. These policies aim to protect infants from the potential harm of infection from their mothers, yet they may fail to fully account for the impact of separation. Global COVID-19 data are suggestive of potentially lower susceptibility and a typically milder course of disease among children, although the potential for severe disease in infancy remains. Separation causes cumulative harms, including disrupting breastfeeding and limiting its protection against infectious disease, which has disproportionate impacts on vulnerable infants. Separation also presumes the replaceability of breastfeeding-a risk that is magnified in emergencies. Moreover, separation does not ensure lower viral exposure during hospitalizations and post-discharge, and contributes to the burden on overwhelmed health systems. Finally, separation magnifies maternal health consequences of insufficient breastfeeding and compounds trauma in communities who have experienced long-standing inequities and violence, including family separation. Taken together, separating PUI/confirmed SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers and their infants may lead to excess preventable illnesses and deaths among infants and women around the world. Health services must consider the short-andlong-term impacts of separating mothers and infants in their policies.","Tomori, Cecília; Gribble, Karleen; Palmquist, Aunchalee E L; Ververs, Mija-Tesse; Gross, Marielle S",Matern Child Nutr,465,15

(Shanghai, China). It combines a Carm linac with a diagnostic-quality 16-slice CT imager, providing seamless workflow from simulation to treatment. The aim of this report is to assess the technical characteristics, commissioning results and preliminary experiences stemming from clinical usage. METHODS: The mechanical and imaging test procedures, commissioning data collection and TPS validation were summarized. CTIGRT accuracy was investigated with different loads and couch extensions. A series of end-to-end cases for different treatment sites and delivery techniques were tested preclinically to estimate the overall accuracy for the entire treatment scheme. The results of patient-specific QA and machine stability during a one-year operation are also reported. RESULTS: Gantry/couch/collimator isocentricity was measured as 0.63 mm in radius. The TPS models were in agreement with the beam commissioning data within a deviation of 2%. An overall submillimeter accuracy was demonstrated for the CT-IGRT process under all conditions. The absolute point dose difference for all the preclinical end-to-end tests was within 3%, and the gamma passing rate of the 2D dose distribution measured by EBT3 film was better than 90% (3% DD, 3 mm DTA and 10% threshold). Pretreatment QA of clinical cases resulted with better than 3% point dose difference and more than 99% gamma passing rate (3% DD/2 mm DTA/10% threshold) tested with Delta4. The output of the linac was mostly within 1% of variation in a one-year operation. CONCLUSION: The commissioning results and clinical QA results show that the uRT-linac 506c platform exhibits good and stable performance in mechanical and dosimetric accuracy. The integrated CT system provides an efficient workflow for image guidance with submillimeter localization precision, and will be a good starting point to proceed advanced adaptive radiotherapy.","Yu, Lei; Zhao, Jun; Zhang, Zhen; Wang, Jiazhou; Hu, Weigang",J. appl. clin. med. phys,465,23

In this study, chlorhexidine gluconate was investigated as a topical antimicrobial agent against SARS-CoV-2. This was a randomized, prospective cohort study using chlorhexidine as an oral rinse and posterior oropharyngeal spray in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The primary outcome was presence or absence of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in the oral and oropharyngeal cavities after 4 days of chlorhexidine use and standard of care (study group) or standard of care only (control group). SARS-CoV-2 was eliminated from the oropharynx in 62.1% of patients who used chlorhexidine as an oral rinse, versus 5.5% of the control group patients. Among patients who used a combination of oral rinse and oropharyngeal spray, 86.0% eliminated oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2, versus 6.3% of control patients. Chlorhexidine is a simple and safe addition to current COVID-19 prevention guidelines and may play a significant role in reducing disease spread.","Huang, Y Hanna; Huang, Jong T",J Med Virol,465,16

Significant efforts to improving safety have been employed, including the use of personal protective equipment, preoperative COVID-19 testing, and recently the use of a modified surgical mask barrier. OBJECTIVE: To reduce the risks of pathogen transmission during endoscopic skull base surgery. METHODS: This study was exempt from Institutional Review Board approval. Our study utilizes a 3-dimensional (3D)-printed mask with an anterior aperture fitted with a surgical glove with ports designed to allow for surgical instrumentation and side ports to accommodate suction ventilation and an endotracheal tube. As an alternative, a modified laparoscopic surgery trocar served as a port for instruments, and, on the contralateral side, rubber tubing was used over the endoscrub endosheath to create an airtight seal. Surgical freedom and aerosolization were tested in both modalities. RESULTS: The ventilated mask allowed for excellent surgical maneuverability and freedom. The trocar system was effective for posterior surgical procedures, allowing access to critical paramedian structures, and afforded a superior surgical seal, but was limited in terms of visualization and maneuverability during anterior approaches. Aerosolization was reduced using both the mask and nasal trocar. CONCLUSION: The ventilated upper airway endoscopic procedure mask allows for a sealed surgical barrier during endoscopic skull base surgery and may play a critical role in advancing skull base surgery in the COVID-19 era. The nasal trocar may be a useful alternative in instances where 3D printing is not available. Additional studies are needed to validate these preliminary findings.","Helman, Samuel N; Soriano, Roberto M; Tomov, Martin L; Serpooshan, Vahid; Levy, Joshua M; Pradilla, Gustavo; Solares, C Arturo",Oper Neurosurg (Hagerstown),465,24

However, such performance is only guaranteed if the input to a trained model is similar to the training samples, i.e., the input follows the probability distribution of the training set. Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples do not follow the distribution of training set, and therefore the predicted class labels on OOD samples become meaningless. Classification-based methods have been proposed for OOD detection; however, in this study we show that this type of method is theoretically ineffective and practically breakable because of dimensionality reduction in the model. We also show that Glow likelihood-based OOD detection is ineffective as well. Our analysis is demonstrated on five open datasets, including a COVID-19 CT dataset. At last, we present a simple theoretical solution with guaranteed performance for OOD detection.","Liang, Liang; Ma, Linhai; Qian, Linchen; Chen, Jiasong",,465,1

METHODS: All confirmed cases with COVID-19 in Wenzhou from January 19 to February 20, 2020, were collected and analyzed. Of the 116 patients with COVID-19, 27 were diagnosed as severe cases. Among severe cases, 9 were treated in ICU. The data of blood routine examination were analyzed and compared among common patients (as common group), severe patients admitted to intensive care unit (as severe ICU group) and severe patients not admitted to ICU (as severe non-ICU group). The blood routine examination results were dynamically observed in the above groups after admission. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 have lower counts of leucocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils, platelets, and hemoglobin, but have higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and monocyte-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), which were compared with controls (P < 0.001). In severe ICU group, patients have the lowest count of lymphocytes, but the highest neutrophil count and NLR among the above three groups (all P values < 0.05); NLR and MLR indicators were combined for diagnostic efficacy analysis of severe COVID-19, and its area under the curve reached 0.925. The odds ratio of the delay in days to the start of the increase of eosinophil count for predicting the outcome of patients with severe COVID-19 was 2.291 after age adjusted. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 have abnormal peripheral blood routine examination results. Dynamic surveillance of peripheral blood system especially eosinophils is helpful in the prediction of severe COVID-19 cases.","Sun, Suyu; Cai, Xuejiao; Wang, Huaguo; He, Guiqing; Lin, Yin; Lu, Bibi; Chen, Chaoyue; Pan, Yong; Hu, Xingzhong",Clin Chim Acta,465,16

We performed a meta-analysis to understand efficacy and safety. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases (from January 1, 2020 to November 5, 2020). We included RCTs comparing the efficacy and safety of remdesivir to control/placebo in COVID-19. Two independent investigators abstracted data, assessed the quality of evidence, and rated the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: A total of 4 RCTs with 7334 patients with COVID-19 were included. At a follow-up of 28-29 days from randomization, very low certainty evidence showed that use of remdesivir compared with control group (placebo and/or standard of care) was not associated with a significant decrease in time to clinical improvement (standardized mean difference -0.80 day; [CI, -2.12, 0.53]). However, moderate certainty of evidence showed that remdesivir was associated with higher rates of recovered patients (risk difference [RD] 0.07 [0.05, 0.08]) and discharged patients (RD 0.07 [0.03, 0.11]) and lower rates of developing serious adverse events (RD -0.05 [-0.10, -0.01]) compared with control. Moderate and very low certainty of evidence showed there was no significant difference in deaths at 28-29 days follow-up (RD -0.01 [-0.03, 0.01]) and developing any adverse events (RD 0.01 [-0.17, 0.19]) between both groups, respectively.

Data sourcesWe utilized individual-level data on health care use, vaccination, employment, and demographics available in the Norwegian emergency preparedness register BeredtC19. Study designUsing an event-study design with a matched comparison group and multiple time periods, we compared the change in primary and inpatient specialist care use for vaccinated health care workers from 14 days before to 14 days after the information shock on March 11th, 2021. Data collectionNot applicable. Principal findingsPrimary health care use rose sharply by 66% (95%CI 60.7 to 71.3) the week following March 11th for those vaccinated with AstraZeneca (n = 87,632), compared with no rise for the unvaccinated comparison group (n = 175,264). Utilization of inpatient care also rose by 20% (95%CI -3.7 to 43.7) in week one and 61% (95%CI 27.1 to 94.9) in week two after March 11th. The sharpest increase in primary health care use was found for women aged 18-44 (83%, 95%CI 76.6 to 89.5) and for cleaners working in the health care sector (103 %, 95%CI 36.1 to 166.9). ConclusionsHealth care use was highly affected by the media reports of a few fatal or severe side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Our results suggest that the reports did not only lead vaccinated individuals to contact primary health care more, but also that physicians referred and treated more cases to specialist care because of the new information.","Larsen, Vilde Bergstad; Grøsland, Mari; Telle, Kjetil Elias; Magnusson, Karin",,465,24

METHODS: Between December 31, 2019 and March 7, 2020, 23 hospitalized pregnant patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Clinical presentations were collected retrospectively from records, including laboratory testing, chest CT imaging, and symptoms. Descriptive analysis and correlation of patients' clinical and CT characteristics were performed. Laboratory results from time of first admission and CT absorption (defined as reduction in lesion area, decrease in density, and absorption of some solid components) were compared between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. RESULTS: Fifteen (65.2%) patients were asymptomatic with patchy ground-glass opacity in a single lung lobe. Eight (34.8%) patients were symptomatic with multiple patchy ground-glass shadows, consolidation, and fibrous stripes. Differences in lymphocyte percentage and neutrophil granulocyte rate between first admission and CT absorption were significant (P<0.001). Median absorption time was shorter in the asymptomatic group compared with the symptomatic group (5 vs 10 days; P<0.001). Median hospitalization time between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients was 14 vs 25.5 days; P>0.001. Median absorption time and length of hospitalization for all patients was 6 days (IQR 5-8) and 17 days (IQR 13-25), respectively. CONCLUSION: Radiological findings and clinical characteristics in pregnant women with COVID-19 were similar to those of non-pregnant women with COVID-19. Median absorption time and length of hospitalization in asymptomatic patients were significantly shorter than in symptomatic patients. Lymphocyte percentage and neutrophil granulocyte rate may be used as laboratory indicators of CT absorption.","Wu, Xiaoqing; Sun, Ruihong; Chen, Jianpu; Xie, Yuanliang; Zhang, Shutong; Wang, Xiang",Int J Gynaecol Obstet,465,24

Thus, female predisposition to pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is an inevitable topic. To better understand the nature of sexual differentiation in the pulmonary circulation, and how heritable factors, in vivo- and/or in vitro-altered estrogen circumstances and changes in the live environment work in concert to discern the sex bias, this chapter reviews pulmonary events characterized by sex-different features, concomitant with exploration of how alterations of genetic expression and estrogen metabolisms trigger the female-predominant pathological signaling. We address the following: PAH (Sect.7.2) is characterized as an estrogenic promotion of its incidence (Sect. 7.2.2), as a function of specific germline mutations, and as an estrogen-elicited protection of its prognosis (Sect.7.2.1). More detail is provided to introduce a less recognized gene of Ephx2 that encodes soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to degrade epoxyeicosatrienic acids (EETs). As a susceptible target of estrogen, Ephx2/sEH expression is downregulated by an estrogen-dependent epigenetic mechanism. Increases in pulmonary EETs then evoke a potentiation of PAH generation, but mitigation of its progression, a phenomenon similar to the estrogen-paradox regulation of PAH. Additionally, the female susceptibility to chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (Sect. 7.3) and asthma (Sect.7.4), but less preference to COVID-19 (Sect. 7.5), and roles of estrogen in their pathogeneses are briefly discussed.","Huang, An; Kandhi, Sharath; Sun, Dong",Adv Exp Med Biol,465,8

Using time-series incidence data, the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) was yielded over time during the COVID-19 containment measures in Malaysia. The value of Rt at the beginning of the epidemic and prior to any interventions in place was used to determine the proportion of the population that needs to be immunized to achieve herd immunity. Rt was strongly influenced by interventions being put in place. We established that at least 74% of the Malaysian population needs to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity against COVID-19. This threshold estimate is somewhat influenced by the availability of an efficacious vaccine. A vaccine with 95% efficacy would approximately synthesize a herd immunity threshold of 78%. We conclude that Rt is a valid estimator to determine the effectiveness of control measures and a parameter of use to synthesize herd immunity thresholds in the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Ganasegeran, Kurubaran Ch’ng Alan Swee Hock Looi Irene",COVID,465,5

Next, a PubMed search was conducted about physical activity and psychological status in children and adolescents under psychological stress. The search identified 368 articles, 28 of which were included in the review. For children, data that revealed a correlation between physical activity and psychological health and sedentary time leading to mood disorders were included. For adolescents, there were nine studies that reported a correlation between physical activity and psychological health and four studies that reported no correlation between physical activity and psychological health. Of the studies that reported a correlation, seven reported that physical activity improves psychological health.

Stage 2: To confirm the efficacy of candidate agents selected on the basis of evidence from Stage 1 in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in an expansion stage. TRIAL DESIGN: ACCORD is a seamless, Phase 2, adaptive, randomised controlled platform study, designed to rapidly test candidate agents in the treatment of COVID-19. Designed as a master protocol with each candidate agent being included via its own sub-protocol, initially randomising equally between each candidate and a single contemporaneous SoC arm (which can adapt into 2:1). Candidate agents currently include bemcentinib, MEDI3506, acalabrutinib, zilucoplan and nebulised heparin. For each candidate a total of 60 patients will be recruited in Stage 1. If Stage 1 provides evidence of efficacy and acceptable safety the candidate will enter Stage 2 where a total of approximately 126 patients will be recruited into each study arm sub-protocol. Enrollees and outcomes will not be shared across the Stages; the endpoint, analysis and sample size for Stage 2 may be adjusted based on evidence from Stage 1. Additional arms may be added as new potential candidate agents are identified via candidate agent specific sub-protocols. PARTICIPANTS: The study will include hospitalised adult patients (&#8805;18 years) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus that causes COVID-19, that clinically meet Grades 3 (hospitalised - mild disease, no oxygen therapy), Grades 4 (hospitalised, oxygen by mask or nasal prongs) and 5 (hospitalised, non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen) of the WHO Working Group on the Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 9-point category ordinal scale. Participants will be recruited from England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Comparator is current standard of care (SoC) for the treatment of COVID-19. Current candidate experimental arms include bemcentinib, MEDI3506, acalabrutinib, zilucoplan and nebulised heparin with others to be added over time. Bemcentinib could potentially reduce viral infection and blocks SARS-CoV-2 spike protein; MEDI3506 is a clinic-ready anti-IL-33 monoclonal antibody with the potential to treat respiratory failure caused by COVID; acalabrutinib is a BTK inhibitor which is anti-viral and anti-inflammatory; zilucoplan is a complement C5 inhibitor which may block the severe inflammatory response in COVID-19 and; nebulised heparin has been shown to bind with the spike protein. ACCORD is linked with the UK national COVID therapeutics task force to help prioritise candidate agents. MAIN OUTCOMES: Time to sustained clinical improvement of at least 2 points (from randomisation) on the WHO 9-point category ordinal scale, live discharge from the hospital, or considered fit for discharge (a score of 0, 1, or 2 on the ordinal scale), whichever comes first, by Day 29 (this will also define the ""responder"" for the response rate analyses). RANDOMISATION: An electronic randomization will be performed by Cenduit using Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Randomisation will be stratified by baseline severity grade. Randomisation will proceed with an equal allocation to each arm and a contemporaneous SoC arm (e.g. 1:1 if control and 1 experimental arm; 1:1:1 if two experimental candidate arms etc) but will be reviewed as the trial progresses and may be changed to 2:1 in favour of the candidate agents. BLINDING (MASKING): The trial is open label and no blinding is currently planned in the study. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): This will be in the order of 60 patients per candidate agent for Stage 1, and 126 patients for Stage 2. However, sample size re-estimation may be considered after Stage 1. It is estimated that up to 1800 patients will participate in the overall study. TRIAL STATUS: Master protocol version ACCORD-2-001 - Master Protocol (Amendment 1) 22nd April 2020, the trial has full regulatory approval and recruitment is ongoing in the bemcentinib (first patient recruited 6/5/2020), MEDI3506 (first patient recruited 19/5/2020), acalabrutinib (first patient recruited 20/5/2020) and zilucoplan (first patient recruited 19/5/2020) candidates (and SoC). The recruitment dates of each arm will vary between candidate agents as they are added or dropped from the trial, but will have recruited and reported within a year.

For this reason, this study aims to find out: (1) what epidemics have occurred in the world; and (2) what we can learn from these epidemics. This research was conducted by following the method of systematic literature review. There are four stages carried out in this study, namely designing the review, doing the review, analysis, and writing the review. The researchers collected the data from books and academic journals relating to infectious diseases that cause epidemics. The collected information is then analyzed qualitatively with an interactive analysis model consisting of three stages: data reduction, data display, conclusion drawing/verification. The results of this study show that: (1) from the general literature there were 12 infectious diseases recorded as epidemics before covid-19, whereas from Islamic religious literature there were registered 12 contagious diseases that became epidemics; and (2) what we can learn from the outbreak is that infectious diseases that become epidemics are pathogenic microorganisms that can adapt (evolve) and have more ability to be able to transmit viruses from a human to another human quickly. Changes in the environment and ecosystems affect the occurrence of epidemics. Climate change contributes to the changes in the background and ecosystems.

In China, some traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) have been successfully applied to the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and have achieved good clinical results, including the Reyanning mixture, but there is no systematic review about it. This study will systematically evaluate its efficacy and safety in the treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: The following electronic bibliographic databases will be searched to identify relevant studies: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CNKI, CBM, and Wanfang databases. We will use the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions to assess the risk of bias. The protocol will be conducted according to the approach and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). Manager 5.3 software and STATA 16.0 software were used to perform the meta-analysis. RESULTS: The systematic review and meta-analysis aims to review and pool current clinical outcomes of Reyanning mixture for the treatment of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The conclusion of this review will provide evidence to judge whether Reyanning mixture combined with Conventional Western Medicine is an effective and safe intervention for COVID-19.

DESIGN: Prospective observational study with retrospective data analysis. SETTING: Academic medical center surgical ICU. PATIENTS: Seventy-two intubated patients with critical illness from coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Therapeutic anticoagulation after imaging diagnosis of the first three deep venous thrombosis cases was confirmed; therapeutic anticoagulation as prophylaxis thereafter to all subsequent ICU admissions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-two patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 were screened for deep venous thrombosis after ICU admission with 102 duplex ultrasound examinations, with 12 cases (16.7%) of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis identified. There were no differences between groups with respect to age, renal function, or biomarkers except for D-dimer (median, 12,858 ng/mL [interquartile range, 3,176-30,770 ng/mL] for lower extremity deep venous thrombosis vs 2,087 ng/mL [interquartile range, 638-3,735 ng/mL] for no evidence of deep venous thrombosis; p < 0.0001). Clinical screening tools (Wells score and Dutch Primary Care Rule) had no utility. The C-statistic for D-dimer concentration was 0.874 ± 0.065. At the model-predicted cutoff value of 3,000 ng/mL, sensitivity was 100%, specificity was 51.1%, positive predictive value was 21.8%, and negative predictive value was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Lower extremity deep venous thrombosis is prevalent in coronavirus disease 2019 disease and can be present on ICU admission. Screening has been recommended in the context of the pro-inflammatory, hypercoagulable background milieu. D-dimer concentrations are elevated in nearly all coronavirus disease 2019 patients, and the test appears reliable for screening for lower extremity deep venous thrombosis at or above a concentration of 3,000 ng/mL (more than 13-fold above the normal range). Full anticoagulation is indicated if the diagnosis is confirmed, and therapeutic anticoagulation should be considered for prophylaxis, as all coronavirus disease 2019 patients are at increased risk.","Gibson, Cameron J; Alqunaibit, Dalia; Smith, Kira E; Bronstein, Matthew; Eachempati, Soumitra R; Kelly, Anton G; Lee, Christina; Minneman, Jennifer A; Narayan, Mayur; Shou, Jian; Villegas, Cassandra V; Winchell, Robert J; Barie, Philip S",Crit. care med,465,6

Using silver-nanorod SERS array functionalized with cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), we obtained strong SERS signals of ACE2 at 1032, 1051, 1089, 1189, 1447 and 1527 cm-1. The recognition and binding of receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on SERS assay significantly quenched the spectral intensities of most peaks and exhibited a shift from 1189 to 1182 cm-1. On-site tests on 23 water samples with a portable Raman spectrometer proved its accuracy and easy-operation for spot detection of SARS-CoV-2 to evaluate disinfection performance, explore viral survival in environmental media, assess viral decay in wastewater treatment plant and track SARS-CoV-2 in pipe network.

The functional importance of ACE2 in different demographic and comorbid conditions may explain the significant variation in incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in vulnerable groups, and highlights its candidacy as a potential therapeutic target. We provide evidence supporting the idea that differences in incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection may be related to ACE2. Emerging data based on the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 among those with established high levels of ACE2 expression strongly support our hypothesis. Considering the burden of COVID-19 infection in these vulnerable groups and the impact of the potential therapeutic and preventive measures that would result from adopting ACE2-driven anti-viral strategies, our hypothesis may expedite global efforts to control the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Kaseb, Ahmed O; Mohamed, Yehia I; Malek, Alexandre E; Raad, Issam I; Altameemi, Lina; Li, Dan; Kaseb, Omar A; Kaseb, Safa A; Selim, Abdelhafez; Ma, Qing",,465,1

The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive evolutionary analysis to describe the human outbreak and the evolutionary rate of different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular evolution in nine genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed using three different approaches: phylogenetic signal assessment, emergence of amino acid substitutions, and Bayesian evolutionary rate estimation in eight successive fortnights since the virus emergence. All observed phylogenetic signals were very low and tree topologies were in agreement with those signals. However, after 4 months of evolution, it was possible to identify regions revealing an incipient viral lineage formation, despite the low phylogenetic signal since fortnight 3. Finally, the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary rate for regions nsp3 and S, the ones presenting greater variability, was estimated as 1.37 × 10-3 and 2.19 × 10-3 substitution/site/year, respectively. In conclusion, results from this study about the variable diversity of crucial viral regions and determination of the evolutionary rate are consequently decisive to understand essential features of viral emergence.

The traditional inverse binomial (IB) model is inappropriate to match the reality of COVID-19, because the collected data contradicts the model’s requirement that variance should be larger than the expected value. Our version of an IB model is more appropriate, as it can accommodate all potential data scenarios in which the variance is smaller, equal, or larger than the mean. This is unlike the usual IB, which accommodates only the scenario in which the variance is more than the mean. Therefore, we propose a refined version of an IB model to be able to accommodate all potential data scenarios. The application of the approach is based on a restricted infectivity rate and methodology on COVID-19 data, which exhibit two clusters of infectivity. Cluster 1 has a smaller number of primary cases and exhibits larger variance than the expected cases with a negative correlation of 28%, implying that the number of secondary cases is lesser when the number of primary cases increases and vice versa. The traditional IB model is appropriate for Cluster 1. The probability of contracting COVID-19 is estimated to be 0.13 among the primary, but is 0.75 among the secondary in Cluster 1, with a wider gap. Cluster 2, with a larger number of primary cases, exhibits smaller variance than the expected cases with a correlation of 79%, implying that the number of primary and secondary cases do increase or decrease together. Cluster 2 disqualifies the traditional IB model and requires its refined version. The probability of contracting COVID-19 is estimated to be 0.74 among the primary, but is 0.72 among the secondary in Cluster 2, with a narrower gap. The advantages of the proposed approach include the model’s ability to estimate the community’s health system memory, as future policies might reduce COVID’s spread. In our approach, the current hazard level to be infected with COVID-19 and the odds of not contracting COVID-19 among the primary in comparison to the secondary groups are estimable and interpretable.","Shanmugam, Ramalingam; Ledlow, Gerald; Singh, Karan P.",PLoS One,465,2

Patients with systemic vasculitis have an increased risk of serious infections and so may be at risk of severe outcomes following COVID‐19. It is important to establish the risk factors for severe COVID‐19 outcomes in these patients, including the impact of immunosuppressive therapies. METHODS: A multi‐centre cohort was developed through the participation of centres affiliated with national UK and Ireland vasculitis registries. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were described. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between potential risk factors and severe COVID‐19 outcome, defined as a requirement for advanced oxygen therapy, invasive ventilation, or death. RESULTS: Sixty‐five cases of patients with systemic vasculitis who developed COVID‐19 were reported (median age 70 years, 49% female) of whom 25 (38%) experienced a severe outcome. Most cases (55/65, 85%) had ANCA‐associated vasculitis (AAV). Almost all patients required hospitalization (59/65, 91%), 7 patients (11%) were admitted to intensive care and 18 patients (28%) died. Background glucocorticoid therapy was associated with severe outcome (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.7 (1.1‐14.9, p=0.047)) as was comorbid respiratory disease (aOR 7.5 (1.9‐38.2, p=0.006)). Vasculitis disease activity and non‐glucocorticoid immunosuppression were not associated with severe outcome. CONCLUSION: In patients with systemic vasculitis, glucocorticoid use at presentation and comorbid respiratory disease were associated with severe outcomes in COVID‐19. These data can inform clinical decision making relating to risk of severe COVID‐19 in this vulnerable patient group.","Rutherford, Matthew A; Scott, Jennifer; Karabayas, Maira; Antonelou, Marilina; Gopaluni, Seerapani; Gray, David; Barrett, Joe; Brix, Silke R; Dhaun, Neeraj; McAdoo, Stephen P; Smith, Rona M; Geddes, Colin; Jayne, David; Luqmani, Raashid; Salama, Alan D; Little, Mark; Basu, Neil",Arthritis Rheumatol,465,29

An elevation of liver damage markers has been observed in numerous cases, which could be related to the empirical use of potentially hepatotoxic drugs. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical and analytical characteristics and perform a causality analysis from laboratory signals available of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) detected by a proactive pharmacovigilance program in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 at La Paz University Hospital in Madrid (Spain) from 1 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. The updated Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) was employed to assess DILI causality. A lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) was performed on 10 patients. Ultimately, 160 patients were included. The incidence of DILI (alanine aminotransferase >5, upper limit of normal) was 4.9%; of these, 60% had previous COVID-19 hepatitis, the stay was 8.1 days longer and 98.1% were being treated with more than 5 drugs. The most frequent mechanism was hepatocellular (57.5%), with mild severity (87.5%) and subsequent recovery (88.1%). The most commonly associated drugs were hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab and ceftriaxone. The highest incidence rate of DILI per 10,000 defined daily doses (DDD) was with remdesivir (992.7/10,000 DDD). Some 80% of the LTTs performed were positive, with a RUCAM score of ≥4. The presence of DILI after COVID-19 was associated with longer hospital stays.

They are proposed to form stacking interactions with polypurine sequences in the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) of selected mRNAs, thereby clamping the RNA substrate onto eIF4A and causing inhibition of the translation initiation complex. Since virus replication relies on the host translation machinery, it is not surprising that the rocaglate Silvestrol has broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Unfortunately, synthesis of Silvestrol is sophisticated and time-consuming, thus hampering the prospects for further antiviral drug development. Here, we present the less complex structured synthetic rocaglate CR-31-B (−) as a novel compound with potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity in primary cells and in an ex vivo bronchial epithelial cell system. CR-31-B (−) inhibited the replication of corona-, Zika-, Lassa-, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses and, to a lesser extent, hepatitis E virus (HEV) at non-cytotoxic low nanomolar concentrations. Since HEV has a polypurine-free 5′-UTR that folds into a stable hairpin structure, we hypothesized that RNA clamping by Silvestrol and its derivatives may also occur in a polypurine-independent but structure-dependent manner. Interestingly, the HEV 5′-UTR conferred sensitivity towards Silvestrol but not to CR-31-B (−). However, if an exposed polypurine stretch was introduced into the HEV 5′-UTR, CR-31-B (−) became an active inhibitor comparable to Silvestrol. Moreover, thermodynamic destabilization of the HEV 5′-UTR led to reduced translational inhibition by Silvestrol, suggesting differences between rocaglates in their mode of action, most probably by engaging Silvestrol's additional dioxane moiety.","Müller, Christin; Obermann, Wiebke; Schulte, Falk W.; Lange-Grünweller, Kerstin; Oestereich, Lisa; Elgner, Fabian; Glitscher, Mirco; Hildt, Eberhard; Singh, Kamini; Wendel, Hans-Guido; Hartmann, Roland K.; Ziebuhr, John; Grünweller, Arnold",Antiviral Res,465,23

This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the country. The outbreak rapidly escalated to a national level epidemic, amid the WHO declaration of a pandemic. Methods We analysed data from the national case-based integrated surveillance system of all RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infections as of March 24th 2020, collected from all Italian regions and autonomous provinces. Here we provide a descriptive epidemiological summary on the first 62,843 COVID-19 cases in Italy as well as estimates of the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. Findings Of the 62,843 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 71.6% were reported from three Regions (Lombardia, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna). All cases reported after February 20th were locally acquired. Estimates of R0 varied between 2.5 (95%CI: 2.18-2.83) in Toscana and 3 (95%CI: 2.68-3.33) in Lazio, with epidemic doubling time of 3.2 days (95%CI: 2.3-5.2) and 2.9 days (95%CI: 2.2-4.3), respectively. The net reproduction number showed a decreasing trend starting around February 20-25, 2020 in northern regions. Notably, 5,760 cases were reported among health care workers. Of the 5,541 reported COVID-19 associated deaths, 49% occurred in people aged 80 years or above with an overall crude CFR of 8.8%. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Interpretation The COVID-19 infection in Italy emerged with a clustering onset similar to the one described in Wuhan, China and likewise showed worse outcomes in older males with comorbidities. Initial R0 at 2.96 in Lombardia, explains the high case-load and rapid geographical spread observed. Overall Rt in Italian regions is currently decreasing albeit with large diversities across the country, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.","Riccardo, Flavia; Ajelli, Marco; Andrianou, Xanthi; Bella, Antonino; Del Manso, Martina; Fabiani, Massimo; Bellino, Stefania; Boros, Stefano; Mateo Urdiales, Alberto; Marziano, Valentina; Rota, Maria Cristina; Filia, Antonietta; D'Ancona, Fortunato (Paolo); Siddu, Andrea; Punzo, Ornella; Trentini, Filippo; Guzzetta, Giorgio; Poletti, Piero; Stefanelli, Paola; Castrucci, Maria Rita; Ciervo, Alessandra; Di Benedetto, Corrado; Tallon, Marco; Piccioli, Andrea; Brusaferro, Silvio; Rezza, Giovanni; Merler, Stefano; Pezzotti, Patrizio",,465,28

Methods Epidemiological information and clinical data were collected from 35 children patients. Viral RNAs in respiratory and fecal samples were detected. Plasma of 11 patients were collected and measured for 48 cytokines. Results 40% (14/35) of the children COVID-19 patients showed asymptomatic infections, while pneumonia shown by CT scan occurred in most of the cases (32/35, 91.43%). Elevated LDH, AST, CRP, neutropenia, leukopenia, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in some cases, and CD4 and CD8 counts were normal. A total of 22 cytokines were significantly higher than the healthy control, and IP-10, IFN-2 of them in children were significantly lower than the adult patients. Meanwhile, MCP-3, HGF, MIP-1, and IL-1ra were similar or lower than healthy control, while significantly lower than adult patients. Viral RNAs were detected as early as the first day after illness onset (d.a.o) in both the respiratory and fecal samples. Viral RNAs decreased as the disease progression and mostly became negative in respiratory samples within 18 d.a.o, while maintained relatively stable during the disease progression and still detectable in some cases during 36~42 d.a.o. Conclusion COVID-19 in children was mild, and asymptomatic infection was common. Immune responses were relatively normal in children COVID-19 patients. Cytokine storm also occurred in children patients, while much weaker than adult patients. Positive rate of viral RNAs in fecal samples was high, and profile of viral shedding were different between respiratory and gastrointestinal tract.","Yang, Yang; Zheng, Haixia; Peng, Ling; Wei, Jinli; Wang, Yanrong; Li, Xiaohe; Peng, Bo; Fang, Shisong; Zhang, Mingxia; Liu, Hui; Li, Yanjie; Feng, Kai; Xing, Li; Wang, Jun; Cao, Mengli; Wang, Fuxiang; Liu, Yingxia; Liu, Lei; Yuan, Jing",,465,20

To understand the evolution of HBV‐related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and to correlate these SNPs with chronic HBV infection among different populations, we conducted a global perspective study on hepatitis‐related SNPs. We selected 12 HBV‐related SNPs on the HLA locus and two HBV and three hepatitis C virus immune‐related SNPs for analysis. Five nasopharyngeal carcinoma‐related SNPs served as controls. All SNP data worldwide from 26 populations were downloaded from 1,000 genomes. We found a dramatic difference in the allele frequency in most of the HBV‐ and HLA‐related SNPs in East Asia compared to the other continents. A sharp change in allele frequency in 8 of 12 SNPs was found between Bengali populations in Bangladesh and Chinese Dai populations in Xishuangbanna, China (P < 0.001); these areas represent the junction of South and East Asia. For the immune‐related SNPs, significant changes were found after leaving Africa. Most of these genes shifted from higher expression genotypes in Africa to lower expression genotypes in either Europe or South Asia (P < 0.001). During this two‐stage adaptation, immunity adjusted toward a weak immune response, which could have been a survival strategy during human migration to East Asia. The prevalence of chronic HBV infection in Africa is as high as in Asia; however, the HBV‐related SNP genotypes are not present in Africa, and so the genetic mechanism of chronic HBV infection in Africa needs further exploration. Conclusion: Two stages of genetic changes toward a weak immune response occurred when humans migrated out of Africa. These changes could be a survival strategy for avoiding cytokine storms and surviving in new environments.

After binding of mannan-binding lectin (MBL), ficolins or collectin 11 to carbohydrates or acetylated residues on pathogen surfaces, dimers of MBL-associated serine proteases 1 and 2 (MASP-1 and MASP-2) activate a proteolytic cascade, which culminates in the formation of the membrane attack complex and pathogen lysis. Alternative splicing of the pre-mRNA encoding MASP-1 results in two other products, MASP-3 and MAp44, which regulate activation of the cascade. A similar mechanism allows the gene encoding MASP-2 to produce the truncated MAp19 protein. Polymorphisms in MASP1 and MASP2 genes are associated with protein serum levels and functional activity. Since the first report of a MASP deficiency in 2003, deficiencies in lectin pathway proteins have been associated with recurrent infections and several polymorphisms were associated with the susceptibility or protection to infectious diseases. In this review, we summarize the findings on the role of MASP polymorphisms and serum levels in bacterial, viral and protozoan infectious diseases.","Beltrame, Marcia H.; Boldt, Angelica B.W.; Catarino, Sandra J.; Mendes, Hellen C.; Boschmann, Stefanie E.; Goeldner, Isabela; Messias-Reason, Iara",Mol Immunol,465,1

Despite the usability of IC, the sensitivity is approximately 10(3) pfu per reaction. In addition, antigen-antibody interaction-based method cannot be used for the detection of influenza viruses with major antigenic change. In this study, we established the use of fluorescent immunochromatography (FLIC) to detect a broad spectrum of H5 subtype influenza A viruses. This method has improved sensitivity 10–100 fold higher than traditional IC because of the use of fluorescent conjugated beads. Our Type-E FLIC kit detected all of the H5 subtype influenza viruses that were examined, as well as recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) proteins (rHAs) belonging to the Eurasian H5 subtype viruses and the Type-N diagnosed North American H5 subtype influenza A viruses. Thus, this kit has the improved potential to detect H5 subtype influenza viruses of different clades with both Type-E and Type-N FLIC kits. Compared with PCR-based diagnosis, FLIC has a strong advantage in usability, because the sample preparation required for FLIC is only mix-and-drop without any additional steps such as RNA extraction.

It is to study whether an image contains a suspicious tampered area pasted from another image. In this paper, we propose a new image tamper location method based on dual-channel U-Net, that is, DCU-Net. The detection framework based on DCU-Net is mainly divided into three parts: encoder, feature fusion, and decoder. Firstly, high-pass filters are used to extract the residual of the tampered image and generate the residual image, which contains the edge information of the tampered area. Secondly, a dual-channel encoding network model is constructed. The input of the model is the original tampered image and the tampered residual image. Then, the deep features extracted from the dual-channel encoding network are fused for the first time, and then the tampered features with different granularity are extracted by dilation convolution, and then, the secondary fusion is carried out. Finally, the fused feature map is input into the decoder, and the predicted image is decoded layer by layer. The experimental results on Casia2.0 and Columbia datasets show that DCU-Net performs better than the latest algorithm and can accurately locate tampered areas. In addition, the attack experiments show that DCU-Net model has good robustness and can resist noise and JPEG recompression attacks.","Ding, Hongwei; Chen, Leiyang; Tao, Qi; Fu, Zhongwang; Dong, Liang; Cui, Xiaohui",Neural Comput Appl,465,16

To our knowledge, no prior study has analyzed a CDC Twitter handle’s entire contents and all followers. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the contents and followers of the Twitter profile @CDC_AMD and to assess if attaching photos or videos to tweets posted by @CDC_AMD would increase retweet frequency. METHODS: Data of @CDC_AMD were retrieved on November 21, 2016. All followers (N=809) were manually categorized. All tweets (N=768) were manually coded for contents and whether photos or videos were attached. Retweet count for each tweet was recorded. Negative binomial regression models were applied to both the original and the retweet corpora. RESULTS: Among the 809 followers, 26.0% (210/809) were individual health professionals, 11.6% (94/809) nongovernmental organizations, 3.3% (27/809) government agencies’ accounts, 3.3% (27/809) accounts of media organizations and journalists, and 0.9% (7/809) academic journals, with 54.9% (444/809) categorized as miscellaneous.

These changes created numerous challenges for facilities communicating with families, and between families and residents. However, little is known about how these facilities addressed these communication challenges and how those communication strategies were related to family perceptions about the facility. We implemented an online survey of family members or friends of residents in LTCFs from April 28 to June 19, 2020, using convenience sampling. A total of 174 responses nationwide reported the types of communications used, frequency of communication and alternative visits, and whether respondents had peace of mind, would recommend the facility, or were considering removing the resident from the facility. The results of our hierarchical logistic regression showed that respondents felt greater peace of mind when there were multiple communication channels to contact the resident. Also, respondents had more negative perceptions of a facility when they were not informed about confirmed COVID cases.

We aimed to assess the relationship between parental and child screen use and home environment characteristics. (2) Methods: Thirty-six 3–to-4-year-old healthy children were recruited. Parents reported their own and their child’s weekday and weekend daytime screen use. The child’s home environment and parent-child interactions were assessed using the Infant-Toddler Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment (IT-HOME). Analyses were run to identify relationships between parental and child screen use and the six subscales of the IT-HOME: Responsivity, Acceptance, Organization, Learning Materials, Involvement and Variety. (3) Results: Parents’ weekend screen use was correlated to parental responsivity and variety of people and events at home. These relationships remained significant after adjusting for maternal education and number of children at home (Responsivity β = 7.30 (95% CI: 1.75, 12.86), p = 0.012) and (Variety β = −2.45, (95% CI: −4.58, −0.31), p = 0.026). There was a trend level association between low child’s weekend screen use and high presence of learning materials. Other aspects of screen time were not associated with home environment characteristics. (4) Conclusions: Higher parental screen use predicted lower variety and greater parental responsivity, the latter of which was an unexpected finding. Administering the IT-HOME alongside a screen use questionnaire may offer the opportunity for a more comprehensive representation of home environments in today’s society. Future research can also clarify facets of parental screen use (e.g., co-viewing, timing) that are more vs. less likely to impact children.","Attai, Parveen; Szabat, Jacqueline; Anzman-Frasca, Stephanie; Kong, Kai Ling",Int J Environ Res Public Health,465,16

However, the excessive inflammatory response can damage host tissues and pose serious threats. Exopolysaccharide (EPS), one of the postbiotics, is secreted from lactic acid bacteria. Although many studies have described the beneficial effects of EPS, such as its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, its underlying mechanisms have remained to be poorly understood. Thus, we identified that EPS obtained from Lactobacillus plantarum L-14 was a homogeneous polysaccharide primarily comprised of glucose. To examine these anti-inflammatory effects, an inflammatory response was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration to mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells that were pretreated with EPS. The anti-inflammatory effects of EPS were identified by analyzing the changes within inflammatory markers at the molecular level. We demonstrate here that EPS suppressed proinflammatory mediators, such as cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1β, and downregulated the expression of an inducible nitric oxide synthase known to lead to oxidative stress. It was also confirmed that EPS had anti-inflammatory effects by blocking the interaction of LPS with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), as demonstrated by using the known TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242. In addition, we found that EPS itself could suppress the expression of TLR4. Consequently, our data suggest that EPS can be a potential target for the development of natural product-derived medicine for treating inflammatory diseases related to TLR4.","Kwon, Mijin; Lee, Jaehoon; Park, Sangkyu; Kwon, Oh-Hee; Seo, Jeongmin; Roh, Sangho",Int J Mol Sci,465,14

RESULTS: During the period mentioned above, the average daily number of COVID-19 deaths was approximately 45.2. Poisson distributed lag non-linear model showed that there was a non-linear relationship (U-shape) between the effect of ambient temperature and mortality. With confounding factors controlled, the daily cumulative relative death risk decreased by 12.3% (95% CI [3.4, 20.4%]) for every 1.0 °C increase in temperature. Moreover, the delayed effects of the low temperature are acute and short-term, with the most considerable risk occurring in 5–7 days of exposure. The delayed effects of the high temperature appeared quickly, then decrease rapidly, and increased sharply 15 days of exposure, mainly manifested as acute and long-term effects. Sensitivity analysis results demonstrated that the results were robust. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between ambient temperature and COVID-19 mortality was non-linear. There was a negative correlation between the cumulative relative risk of death and temperature. Additionally, exposure to high and low temperatures had divergent impacts on mortality.","Zhu, Gaopei; Zhu, Yuhang; Wang, Zhongli; Meng, Weijing; Wang, Xiaoxuan; Feng, Jianing; Li, Juan; Xiao, Yufei; Shi, Fuyan; Wang, Suzhen",BMC Public Health,465,20

What has emerged is the need for finding an efficient, quick and accurate method to mitigate the overloading of radiologists’ efforts to diagnose the suspected cases. This study presents the combination of deep learning of extracted features with the Q-deformed entropy handcrafted features for discriminating between COVID-19 coronavirus, pneumonia and healthy computed tomography (CT) lung scans. In this study, pre-processing is used to reduce the effect of intensity variations between CT slices. Then histogram thresholding is used to isolate the background of the CT lung scan. Each CT lung scan undergoes a feature extraction which involves deep learning and a Q-deformed entropy algorithm. The obtained features are classified using a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network classifier. Subsequently, combining all extracted features significantly improves the performance of the LSTM network to precisely discriminate between COVID-19, pneumonia and healthy cases. The maximum achieved accuracy for classifying the collected dataset comprising 321 patients is 99.68%.","Hasan, Ali M.; AL-Jawad, Mohammed M.; Jalab, Hamid A.; Shaiba, Hadil; Ibrahim, Rabha W.; AL-Shamasneh, Ala’a R.",Entropy (Basel),465,33

This study aims to show the potential positive effects of COVID-19 on the environment and the increase of renewable energy generation in Malaysia. To prevent the spread of this disease, Malaysia enacted the Movement Control Order (MCO) law in March 2020. Implementation of this law led to a reduction in environmental pollution, especially air pollution, in this country. The greenhouse gases (GHG) emission , which was 8 Mt CO(2) eq. from January 2020 to March 2020, reduced to <1 Mt CO(2) eq. for April and May. The reduction of GHG emission and pollutant gases allowed more sunlight to reach photovoltaic panels, hence increasing the renewable energy generation.","Naderipour, Amirreza; Abdul-Malek, Zulkurnain; Ahmad, Noor Azlinda; Kamyab, Hesam; Ashokkumar, Veeramuthu; Ngamcharussrivichai, Chawalit; Chelliapan, Shreeshivadasan",Environ Technol Innov,465,21

This led to a major setback for cancer patients jeopardizing their treatment plans. This study analyzes the coping mechanisms of running outpatient and inpatient palliative care services in these COVID-19 times – the New Normal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational study was conducted in the pain and palliative care unit at a tertiary care hospital, India. The data were collected from March 23, 2020, to May 22, 2020, of all patients coming to the clinic and inpatient referrals. Using manual and electronic records, demographic data was collected along with clinical data. Additional data were compiled with special attention to the patient's pain and its management. RESULTS: Despite complete lockdown and initial low patient load, we saw a progressive increase in the number of patients coming to the clinic. A total of 108 patients visited our clinic (65 male and 43 female), of which 78% of the patients were from Delhi. The median age was 43.94 years (range 6 years to 76 years). We had 33 new and 75 old registered cases coming. The main reason was new-onset pain because of noncompliance of drugs; the opioid stock finished with the patient. We saw a very high number of patients requiring strong and weak opioids. Proper personal protection and social distancing helped in preventing crossinfection. None of our staff or patients fell ill during this time. Communication skills were modified to convey feelings and empathize patients. Telemedicine using phone and video calls was used and found to be useful. CONCLUSION: We share our experience and challenges of providing palliative care in our clinic which can be modified as per the individual requirements in other setups.","Khurana, Deepa Kerketta; Raheja, Saveena Gulati; Dayal, Madhu; Pande, Dimple; Ganapathy, Usha",Indian J Palliat Care,465,1

We sought to estimate the spectrum of RV diversity, RV species seasonality and to analyse RV involvement in respiratory virus co-detections. METHODOLOGY: A convenience collection of 1179 airway sample extracts from patients with suspected respiratory infections, collected during 2001, was subjected to comprehensive molecular testing. RESULTS: RVs were the most common virus detected. We were able to genotype ~90 % of RV detections, identifying 70 distinct RVs, spanning all three species. RV-Bs were under-represented. We found RV species co-circulated at times, although one species usually dominated. Each species displayed a bimodal distribution. CONCLUSION: Notably, RVs and influenza A viruses (IFAV) seldom co-occurred, supporting their roles as primary pathogens of the airway among acutely ill infants. Whether RV circulation has a moderating or controlling effect on the IFAV season or is controlled by it cannot be determined from these data. Despite the frequent perception that RVs commonly co-occur with another virus, our findings indicated this was not always the case. Nearly 80 % of RV detections occurred alone. Understanding more about population-level interference between viruses may allow us to harness aspects of it to generate a non-specific antiviral intervention that mimics a putative protective effect. For routine respiratory virus screening to best serve the patient, RV testing should be a principal component of any acute respiratory illness testing algorithm throughout the year.","Arden, Katherine E.; Greer, Ristan M.; Wang, Claire Y.T.; Mackay, Ian M.",Access Microbiol,465,30

We present an overview of local experience with dialysis unit management and reorganisation, local epidemiology and outcomes during the COVID-19 outbreak in Geneva, Switzerland, where SARS-CoV-2 incidence was one of the highest in Europe. METHODS: All SARS-CoV-2-positive outpatients on maintenance dialysis were transferred from their usual dialysis facility to the Geneva University Hospitals dialysis unit to avoid creation of new clusters of transmission. Within this unit, appropriate mitigation measures were enforced, as suggested by the institutional team for prevention and control of infectious diseases. RESULTS: From 25 February to 31 December 2020, 82 of 279 patients on maintenance dialysis tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during two distinct waves, with an incidence rate of 73 cases per 100,000 person-days during the first wave and 342 cases per 100,000 during the second wave, approximately four- to six-fold higher than the general population. The majority of infections (55%) during both waves were traced to clusters. Most infections (62%) occurred in men. Sixteen patients (34%) died from COVID-19 related complications. Deceased patients were older and had a lower body mass index as compared with patients who survived the infection. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 is associated with high infection and fatality rates in the dialysis population. Strict mitigation measures seemed to be effective in controlling infection spread among patients on maintenance dialysis outside of clusters. Large scale epidemiological studies are needed to assess the efficacy of preventive measures in decreasing infection and mortality rates within the dialysis population.","Zamberg, Ido; Mavrakanas, Thomas; Ernandez, Thomas; Bourquin, Vincent; Zellweger, Michael; Marangon, Nicolas; Raimbault, Françoise; Winzeler, Rebecca; Iten, Anne; Hammer, Nathalie; Ponte, Belen; Carballo, Sebastian; Martin, Pierre-Yves; Saudan, Patrick",Swiss med. wkly,465,10

Viruses that can be inhibited by arbidol include enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, RNA and DNA viruses, as well as pH-independent and pH-dependent ones. These differences in viral types highlight the broad spectrum of Arb antiviral activity and, therefore, it must affect a common viral critical step. Arbidol incorporates rapidly into biological membranes, and some of its antiviral effects might be related to its capacity to interact with and locate into the membrane. However, no information is available of the molecular basis of its antiviral mechanism/s. We have aimed to locate the protonated (Arp) and unprotonated (Arb) forms of arbidol in a model membrane system. Both Arb and Arp locate in between the hydrocarbon acyl chains of the phospholipids but its specific location and molecular interactions differ from each other. Whereas both Arb and Arp average location in the membrane palisade is a similar one, Arb tends to be perpendicular to the membrane surface, whereas Arp tends to be parallel to it. Furthermore, Arp, in contrast to Arb, seems to interact stronger with POPG than with POPC, implying the existence of a specific interaction between Arp, the protonated from, with negatively charged phospholipids. This data would suggest that the active molecule of arbidol in the membrane is the protonated one, i.e., the positively charged molecule. The broad antiviral activity of arbidol would be defined by the perturbation it exerts on membrane structure and therefore membrane functioning.

In this randomized clinical trial, the efficacy and safety of IFN β-1a were evaluated in patients with severe COVID-19. Forty-two patients in the interferon group received IFN β-1a in addition to the national protocol medications (hydroxychloroquine plus lopinavir-ritonavir or atazanavir-ritonavir). Each 44-μg/ml (12 million IU/ml) dose of interferon β-1a was subcutaneously injected three times weekly for two consecutive weeks. The control group consisted of 39 patients who received only the national protocol medications. The primary outcome of the study was time to reach clinical response. Secondary outcomes were duration of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit stay, 28-day mortality, effect of early or late administration of IFN on mortality, adverse effects, and complications during the hospitalization. Between 29 February and 3 April 2020, 92 patients were recruited, and a total of 42 patients in the IFN group and 39 patients in the control group completed the study. As the primary outcome, time to the clinical response was not significantly different between the IFN and the control groups (9.7 ± 5.8 versus 8.3 ± 4.9 days, respectively, P = 0.95).

Economic insecurity and mental disorders are risk factors for suicide, which may increase during the pandemic. METHODS: Data on suicide events in a major city in Germany, and the corresponding life years (LY) were provided by the local authorities. For the year 2020, periods without restrictions on freedom of movement and social contact were compared with periods of moderate and severe COVID-19 restrictions. To avoid distortions due to seasonal fluctuations and linear time trends, suicide risk during the COVID-19 pandemic was compared with data from 2010 to 2019 using an interrupted time series analysis. RESULTS: A total of 643 suicides were registered and 6 032 690 LY were spent between 2010 and 2020. Of these, 53 suicides and 450 429 LY accounted for the year 2020. In 2020, SR (suicides per 100 000 LY) were lower in periods with severe COVID-19 restrictions (SR = 7.2, χ(2) = 4.033, p = 0.045) compared with periods without restrictions (SR = 16.8). A comparison with previous years showed that this difference was caused by unusually high SR before the imposition of restrictions, while SR during the pandemic were within the trend corridor of previous years (expected suicides = 32.3, observed suicides = 35; IRR = 1.084, p = 0.682). CONCLUSIONS: SR during COVID-19 pandemic are in line with the trend in previous years. Careful monitoring of SR in the further course of the COVID-19 crisis is urgently needed. The findings have regional reference and should not be over-generalised.","Radeloff, Daniel; Papsdorf, Rainer; Uhlig, Kirsten; Vasilache, Andreas; Putnam, Karen; von Klitzing, Kai",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,465,26

We dissected its detection efficiency with a large COVID-19 cohort study. METHODS: We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 NAT positive rates of 4,275 specimens from 532 COVID-19 patients in Sichuan Province with different disease severities, statuses, and stages, as well as different types and numbers of specimens. RESULTS: The total positive rate of the 4,275 specimens was 37.5%. Among seven specimen types, BALF generated a 77.8% positive rate, followed by URT specimens (38.5%), sputum (39.8%), and feces/rectal swabs (34.1%). Specimens from critical cases generated a 43.4% positive rate, which was significantly higher than that of other severities. With specimens from patients at stable status, the SARS-CoV-2 positive rate was 40.6%, which was significantly higher than that of improved status (17.1%), but lower than that of aggravated status (61.5%). Notably, the positive rate of specimens from COVID-19 patients varied significantly from 85 to 95% during 3 days before and after symptom onset, to 20% at around 18 days after symptom onset. In addition, the detection rate increased from 72.1% after testing one throat swab, to 93.2% after testing three consecutive respiratory specimens from each patient. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 NAT detection rates vary with patient disease severity and status, specimen type, number of specimens, and especially disease progression. Sampling as close to symptom onset as possible, and consecutively collecting more than one respiratory specimen could effectively improve SARS-CoV-2 NAT detection efficiency.","Zhang, Jie; Li, Kecheng; Zheng, Ling; Zhang, Jianbo; Ren, Zhilin; Song, Tiange; Yu, Hua; Yang, Zhenglin; Wang, Li; Jiang, Li",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,465,17

The course of this pandemic will be shaped by how governments enact timely policies and disseminate information and by how the public reacts to policies and information. Here, we examine information-seeking responses to the first COVID-19 case public announcement in a state. Using an event study framework for all US states, we show that such news increases collective attention to the crisis right away. However, the elevated level of attention is short-lived, even though the initial announcements are followed by increasingly strong policy measures. Specifically, searches for “coronavirus” increased by about 36% (95% CI: 27 to 44%) on the day immediately after the first case announcement but decreased back to the baseline level in less than a week or two. We find that people respond to the first report of COVID-19 in their state by immediately seeking information about COVID-19, as measured by searches for coronavirus, coronavirus symptoms, and hand sanitizer. On the other hand, searches for information regarding community-level policies (e.g., quarantine, school closures, testing) or personal health strategies (e.g., masks, grocery delivery, over-the-counter medications) do not appear to be immediately triggered by first reports. These results are representative of the study period being relatively early in the epidemic, and more-elaborate policy responses were not yet part of the public discourse. Further analysis should track evolving patterns of responses to subsequent flows of public information.","Bento, Ana I.; Nguyen, Thuy; Wing, Coady; Lozano-Rojas, Felipe; Ahn, Yong-Yeol; Simon, Kosali",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,465,9

Here, we estimated the safety and reactogenicity of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine as administered to adults after the first dose. METHODS: : This is a cross-sectional study and included 1592 randomly selected vaccinees from April to May, 2021. Questionnaire was delivered to the vaccinees via phone calls 7 and 21 days after the first vaccine dose. RESULTS: : Of the 1592 vaccinees who had the first dose, the mean age was 37.4 (± 9.6) and 81% were males. Of all the vaccinees, 553 (34.7%) reported an adverse reaction on the first call. The most common symptoms were: pain at the site of injection (485, 30.5%), musculoskeletal symptoms (438; 27.5%), skin rash (307, 19.2%), gastrointestinal symptoms (379, 23.8%) and fever (498, 31.3%). Men were more likely to report fever (76.9% vs. 23.1%; P = 0.005), skin rash (81.1% vs. 18.9%, P = 0.005) and pain at the injection site (77.3% vs. 22.7%, P < 0.0001).

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multi‐center study, and followed up with all children from the families with SARS‐CoV‐2 infected members in Zhejiang Province, China. All infections were confirmed by testing the SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA with RT‐PCR method, and epidemiological data between children and adults in the same families was compared. Effect of antiviral therapy was evaluated observationally and fecal viral excretion times among groups with different antiviral regiments were compared with Kaplan Meier plot. RESULTS: By February 29, 2020, 1298 cases from 883 families were confirmed with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and 314 of which were families with children. Incidence of infection in child close contacts was significantly lower than that in adult contacts (13.2% vs 21.2%). The mean age of 43 pediatric cases was 8.2 years and mean incubation period was 9.1 days. Forty (93.0%) were family clustering. Thirty‐three children had COVID‐19 (20 pneumonia) with mild symptoms and 10 were asymptomatic. Fecal SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA detection was positive in 91.4% (32/35) cases and some children had viral excretion time over 70 days. Viral clearance time was not different among the groups treated with different antiviral regiments. No subsequent infection was observed in family contacts of fecal‐viral‐excreting children. CONCLUSION: Children have lower susceptibility of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, longer incubation and fecal viral excretion time. Positive results of fecal SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA detection were not used as indication for hospitalization or quarantine. This article is protected by copyright.

This systematic review and meta-analysis was initiated to clarify the prevalence of respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis in the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic context. Methods We performed an electronic search through Pubmed and Global Index Medicus databases. We included observational studies reporting the detection rate of common respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis using molecular assays. Data was extracted and the quality of the included articles was assessed. We conducted sensitivity, subgroups, publication bias, and heterogeneity analyses using a random effect model. Results The final meta-analysis included 51 studies. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) was largely the most commonly detected virus 59.2%; 95% CI [54.7; 63.6]). The second predominant virus was Rhinovirus (RV) 19.3%; 95% CI [16.7; 22.0]) followed by Human bocavirus (HBoV) 8.2%; 95% CI [5.7; 11.2]). Other reported viruses included Human Adenovirus (HAdV) 6.1%; 95% CI [4.4; 8.0]), Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) 5.4%; 95% CI [4.4; 6.4]), Human Parainfluenzavirus (HPIV) 5.4%; 95% CI [3.8; 7.3]), Influenza 3.2%; 95% CI [2.2; 4.3], mild Human Coronavirus (HCoV) 2.9%; 95% CI [2.0; 4.0]), and Enterovirus (EV) 2.9%; 95% CI [1.6; 4.5]). HRSV was the predominant virus involved in multiple detection and most codetections were HRSV + RV 7.1%, 95% CI [4.6; 9.9]) and HRSV + HBoV 4.5%, 95% CI [2.4; 7.3]). Conclusions The present study has shown that HRSV is the main cause of bronchiolitis in children, we also have Rhinovirus, and Bocavirus which also play a significant role.

Such lockdowns have substantially shrunk production in most countries. This study examines how the economic effects of lockdowns in different regions interact through supply chains, which are a network of firms for production, by simulating an agent-based model of production using supply-chain data for 1.6 million firms in Japan. We further investigate how the complex network structure affects the interactions between lockdown regions, emphasising the role of upstreamness and loops by decomposing supply-chain flows into potential and circular flow components. We find that a region’s upstreamness, intensity of loops, and supplier substitutability in supply chains with other regions largely determine the economic effect of the lockdown in the region. In particular, when a region lifts its lockdown, its economic recovery substantially varies depending on whether it lifts the lockdown alone or together with another region closely linked through supply chains. These results indicate that the economic effect produced by exogenous shocks in a region can affect other regions and therefore this study proposes the need for inter-region policy coordination to reduce economic loss due to lockdowns.","Inoue, Hiroyasu; Murase, Yohsuke; Todo, Yasuyuki",PLoS One,465,29

Two viral glycoproteins are key to the infection process—an attachment protein that varies among different paramyxoviruses and the fusion (F) protein, which is found in all paramyxoviruses. For many of the paramyxoviruses (parainfluenza viruses 1–5, mumps virus, Newcastle disease virus and others), the attachment protein is the hemagglutinin/neuraminidase (HN) protein. In the last 5 years, atomic structures of paramyxovirus F and HN proteins have been reported.

However, little is known regarding the risk factors associated with COVID-19 severity. We aimed to explore early-stage disease risk factors associated with eventual disease severity. Methods : This study enrolled 486 hospitalized, non-intensive care unit (ICU)-admitted adult patients with COVID-19 (age ≥ 18 years) treated at Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, who were divided into three groups according to disease severity. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory data at admission and clinical outcomes were compared among severity groups, and the risk factors for disease severity were identified by multiple regression analysis. Results : Of 486 patients with COVID-19, 405 (83.33%) were discharged, 33 (6.71%) died outside of the ICU, and 48 (7.20%) were still being treated in the ICU by the time the study period ended. Significant differences in age, lymphocyte counts, and the levels of procalcitonin, aspartate aminotransferase, and D-dimer (P < 0.001 for all) among the three groups. Further analysis showed that older age, decreased lymphocyte counts, and increased procalcitonin, aspartate aminotransferase, and D-dimer levels were significantly associated with disease progression. Conclusion : Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may impair the immune system, the blood coagulation system, and hepatic and cardiac function. Some clinical characteristics and laboratory findings can help identify patients with a high risk of disease severity, which can be significant for appropriate resource allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Xu, Jingqing; Cai, Yanping; Li, Min; Li, Qing; Zhang, Yingrui; Jiang, Ying; Yan, Wanli; Chen, Xuemei; Zhang, Hongxuan; Zeng, Zhaonan; Lian, Fayang; Shang, Xiuling; Yu, Rongguo",,465,11

With each passing day, our understanding of the patho-physiology of COVID-19 continues to evolve. A plethora of research has been conducted to explore the dynamics of various different clinical entities related to SARS COV-2 and in particular, COVID-19 associated coagulopathy. A large scale of patients have been reported to have developed pulmonary embolism without any other standard triggers or risk factors. This has led to widespread speculation that the COVID-19 virus by itself is an independent risk factor for VTE. In addition to the development of thromboembolic complications like pulmonary embolism, COVID-19 has also been reported to have triggered disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). At this instance, it is unclear to state if pulmonary embolism was induced by COVID-19 induced thrombosis or if it was precipitated as a result of coagulopathy secondary to DIC. In this case report, we describe a unique case of a COVID associated coagulopathy in a patient with confirmed pulmonary embolism along with an overt DIC. Following the diagnosis, the challenge faced by us was the appropriate treatment modality with regard to this unique situation.

We aimed to provide global, regional, and national estimates of target population sizes for COVID-19 vaccination to inform country-specific immunization strategies on a global scale. Methods Based on a previous study of international allocation for pandemic COVID-19 vaccines, we classified the entire world population into eleven priority groups. Information on priority groups was derived from a multi-pronged search of official websites, media sources and academic journal articles. The sizes of different priority groups were projected for 194 countries globally. Results Overall, the size of COVID-19 vaccine recipient population varied markedly by goals of the vaccination program and geography. The general population aged <60 years without any underlying condition accounts for the majority of the total population (5.2 billion people, 68%), followed by 2.3 billion individuals at risk of severe disease, and 46.9 million essential workers which are critical to maintaining a functional society. Differences in the demographic structure, presence of underlying conditions, and number of essential workers led to highly variable estimates of target populations both at the WHO region and country level. In particular, Europe has the highest share of essential workers (6.8%) and the highest share of individuals with underlying conditions (37.8%), two priority categories to maintain societal functions and reduce severe burden. In contrast, Africa has the highest share of healthy adults, school-age individuals, and infants (77.6%), which are the key groups to target to reduce community transmission. Interpretation The sizeable distribution of target groups on a country and regional bases underlines the importance of equitable and efficient vaccine prioritization and allocation globally. The direct and indirect benefits of COVID-19 vaccination should be balanced by considering local differences in demography and health.","Wang, W.; Wu, Q.; Yang, J.; Dong, K.; Chen, X.; Bai, X.; Chen, Z.; Viboud, C.; Ajelli, M.; Yu, H.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,465,26

The American Academy of Paediatrics recommends 12 well-child visits between birth and age 3 years. Each well-child visit provides a unique opportunity to interact with and support families to promote social emotional development of children. Eighteen US paediatric practices joined a learning community to use improvement science to test and implement evidence-informed strategies that nurture parent–child relationships and promote the social emotional development of young children. Quality improvement methods were used to integrate 11 strategies into well-child visits between birth and age 3 years and measure the improvements with a set of outcome, process and balancing measures. Participation among the 18 paediatric practices was high with 72% of teams attending monthly webinars and 97% of teams attending the three learning sessions. Over 12 months, the percentage of children receiving age-appropriate social emotional development screens at participating practices’ well-child visits increased from a baseline median of 83% to 93%. Current paediatric practice in the USA focuses primarily on cognitive and physical development, and paediatric providers are less familiar with established practices to screen for social emotional development and promote the caregiver–child relationship. This project suggests that improvement methods show promise in increasing the number of children who receive age-appropriate social emotional development screens or assessments at well-child visits.","Johnson, Meghan L; Butts-Dion, Sue; Menon, Meera; Edwards, Kelly; Berns, Scott D",BMJ Open Qual,465,15

The chronic clinical course of the disease may be interrupted by acute inflammatory episodes, named leprosy reactions. These serious immunological complications, characterized by cytokine storms, are responsible for amplifying peripheral nerve damage. From 30% to 40% of all multibacillary leprosy (MB) patients experience erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), a neutrophilic immune-mediated condition. ENL patients often present these same COVID-19-like symptoms, including high levels of serum NET markers, altered NLR, and neutrophilia. Moreover, the consequences of a M. leprae–SARS-CoV-2 coinfection have yet to be fully investigated. The goal of the present viewpoint is to describe some of the similarities that may be found between COVID-19 and leprosy disease in the context of neutrophilic biology.","Schmitz, Veronica; dos Santos, Jéssica Brandão",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,465,24

In South Korea, however, there has been no official statistic related to it. In this study, we extract the time series of influenza incidence from National Health Insurance Service claims database, which consists of all medical and prescription drug-claim records for all South Korean population. The extracted time series contains the number of new patients by region (250 city-county-districts) and age-group (0–4, 5–19, 20–64, 65+) within a week. The number of cases of influenza (2009–2017) is 12,282,356. For computing an onset of influenza outbreak by region and age-group, we propose a novel method for early outbreak detection, in which the onset of outbreak is detected as a sudden change in the time derivative of incidence. The advantage of it over the cumulative sum and the exponentially weighted moving average control charts, which have been widely used for the early outbreak detection of infectious diseases, is that information on the previous non-epidemic periods are not necessary. Then, we show that the metro area and 5–19 age-group are earlier than the rural area and other age-groups for the start of the influenza outbreak. Also, the metro area and 5–19 age-group peak earlier than the rural area and other age-groups. These results would be helpful to design a surveillance system for timely early warning of an influenza outbreak in South Korea.","Son, Woo-Sik; Park, Ji-Eun; Kwon, Okyu",EPJ Data Sci,465,20

The hospitals were forced to reorganize their services, and the ED was the focal point of this challenge. As Emergency Department in a metropolitan area of the region most affected, we saw an increasing number of patients with COVID-19, and we made some structural and staff implementations according to the evolution of the epidemic. METHODS: We analysed in a narrative way the weaknesses and the point of strength of our response to COVID-19 first outbreak, focusing point by point on main challenges and minor details involved in our ED response to the pandemics. RESULTS: The main stems for our response to the pandemic were: use of clear and shared contingency plans, as long as preparedness to implement them; stockage of as much as useful material can be stocked; training of the personnel to be prepared for a fast response, trying to maintain divided pathway for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients, well-done isolation is a key factor; preparedness to de-escalate as soon as needed. CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated our experience and analysed the weakness and strength of our first response to share it with the rest of the scientific community and colleagues worldwide, hoping to facilitate others who will face the same challenge or similar challenges in the future.

A balloon spacer is a relatively simple addition to a standard arthroscopic debridement procedure, but it is costly and there is no current randomised trial evidence to support its use. This trial will evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a subacromial balloon spacer for individuals undergoing arthroscopic debridement for irreparable rotator cuff tears. New surgical procedures can provide substantial benefit to patients. Good quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are needed, but trials in surgery are typically long and expensive, exposing patients to risk and the healthcare system to substantial costs. One way to improve the efficiency of trials is with an adaptive sample size. Such methods are well established in drug trials but have rarely, if ever, been used in surgical trials. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Subacromial spacer for Tears Affecting Rotator cuff Tendons: a Randomised, Efficient, Adaptive Clinical Trial in Surgery (START:REACTS) is a participant and assessor blinded, adaptive, multicentre RCT comparing arthroscopic debridement with the InSpace balloon (Stryker, USA) to arthroscopic debridement alone for people with a symptomatic irreparable rotator cuff tear. It uses a group sequential adaptive design where interim analyses are performed using all of the 3, 6 and 12-month data that are available at each time point.

Our objective was to estimate whether treatment with 400 mg/day of Hydroxychloroquine for 10 days reduces in-hospital mortality in subjects with severe respiratory disease due to COVID-19 compared with placebo. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of severe disease by COVID-19 through an intention-to-treat analysis. Eligible for the study were adults aged more than 18 years with COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR and lung injury requiring hospitalization with or without mechanical ventilation. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary outcomes: days of mechanical ventilation, days of hospitalization and cumulative incidence of serious adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 214 patients with COVID-19 were recruited, randomized and analyzed. They were hypoxemic with a mean SpO(2) of 65% ± 20, tachycardic (pulse rate 108±17 min-(1)) and tachypneic (32 ±10 min-(1)); 162 were under mechanical ventilation at randomization. Thirty-day mortality was similar in both groups (38% in Hydroxychloroquine vs. 41% in placebo, hazard ratio [HR] 0.88, 95% Confidence Interval [95%CI] 0.51–1.53). In the surviving participants, no significant difference was found in secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: No beneficial effect or significant harm could be demonstrated in our randomized controlled trial including 214 patients, using relatively low doses of Hydroxychloroquine compared with placebo in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.","Hernandez-Cardenas, Carmen; Thirion-Romero, Ireri; Rodríguez-Llamazares, Sebastián; Rivera-Martinez, Norma E.; Meza-Meneses, Patricia; Remigio-Luna, Arantxa; Perez-Padilla, Rogelio",PLoS One,465,1

Despite the constant accumulation of genetic variation in the SARS-CoV-2 population, there was little evidence for the emergence of significantly more transmissible lineages in the first half of 2020. Around November 2020, several more contagious and possibly more virulent ‘Variants of Concern’ (VoCs) were detected near-simultaneously in various regions of the world. These VoCs share some mutations and deletions that haven arisen recurrently in distinct genetic backgrounds. Here, we build on our previous work modelling the association of mutations to SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and characterise the contribution of individual recurrent mutations and deletions to estimated viral transmissibility. We estimate enhanced transmissibility associated to mutations characteristic of VoCs and identify a tendency for cytidine to thymidine (C→T) substitutions to be associated to a reduction in estimated transmissibility. We then assess how patterns of estimated transmissibility in all SARS-CoV-2 clades have varied over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic by summing transmissibility estimates for all individual mutations carried by any sequenced genome analysed. Such an approach recovers 501Y.v1 (B.1.1.7) as the most transmissible clade currently in circulation. By assessing transmissibility over the time of sampling, we observe a tendency for estimated transmissibility within clades to slightly decrease in most clades. Although subtle, this pattern is consistent with the expectation of a decay in transmissibility in mainly non-recombining lineages caused by the accumulation of weakly deleterious mutations. SARS-CoV-2 remains a highly transmissible pathogen, though such a trend could conceivably play a role in the turnover of different global viral clades observed over the pandemic so far. Caveats This work is not about the severity of disease. We do not analyse the severity of disease. We do not present any evidence that SARS-CoV-2 has decreased in severity. Lineage replacement dynamics are affected by many factors. The trend we recover for a decrease in inferred transmissibility of a clade over time is a small effect. We caution against over-interpretation. This result would not affect the management of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: for example, we make no claims about any impact on the efficacy of particular non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Our phylogeny-based method to infer changes in estimated transmissibility due to recurrent mutations and deletions makes a number of simplifying assumptions. These may not all be valid. The consistent trend for the slight decrease we report might be due to an as-yet-unidentified systematic bias.","Richard, Damien; Shaw, Liam P; Lanfear, Rob; Acman, Mislav; Owen, Christopher J; Tan, Cedric CS; van Dorp, Lucy; Balloux, François",bioRxiv,465,21

This lymphopenia leads to type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (T1DM) at rates up to 100% when combined with the BB rat MHC RT1 u/u genotype. In order, to better study the lymphopenia phenotype without possible confounding effects of diabetes or other autoimmune disease, we generated congenic F344.lyp rats by introgression of lyp on diabetes-resistant MHC RT1 lv1/lv1 F344 rats. Analysis of thymic CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes revealed no difference in the percentage of CD4(−)CD8(+)and CD4(+)CD8(−)subsets in lyp/lyp compared to +/+ F344 rats. The same subsets was however dramatically reduced in blood (P=0.005), spleen (P=0.019) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) (P<0.0001). Compared to F344 +/+ rats double positive CD4(+)CD8(+)T cells were increased only in lyp/lyp spleen (P=0.034) while double negative CD4(−)CD8(−)were increased in thymus (P=0.033), spleen (P=0.012), MLN (P<0.0001), and peripheral blood (P<0.0001). There were no signs of inflammatory lesions in organs and tissues in F344.lyp/lyp rats examined at 120 days of age or older. We thus conclude that the lymphopenia phenotype was reconstituted by introgression of lyp on to F344 rats without subsequent development of organ-specific autoimmunity. The congenic F344.lyp rat should prove useful to dissect the mechanisms by which the Ian5 frameshift mutation affects T cell selection, differentiation and maturation without organ-specific autoimmunity.","Moralejo, Daniel H.; Park, Hyunhee A.; Speros, Sara J.; MacMurray, Armand J.; Kwitek, Anne E.; Jacob, Howard J.; Lander, Eric S.; Lernmark, Åke",J Autoimmun,465,1

METHOD: This cross-sectional, paper-based study was conducted from June to August 2020. A validated questionnaire (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.84) was used to interview 1,023 pharmacists in nine provinces of Vietnam. Analysis of covariance was employed to identify factors associated with the knowledge of pharmacists. The best model was chosen by using the Bayesian Model Averaging method in R software version 4.0.4. RESULTS: The mean knowledge score was 12.02 ± 1.64 (range: 6–15), which indicated that 93.4% of pharmacists had good knowledge of COVID-19. There was no difference in the average score between males and females (p > 0.05). The multivariate linear regression model revealed that the knowledge was significantly associated with pharmacists’ age, education level, and residence (p < 0.001). About attitude and practices, pharmacists daily sought and updated information on the COVID-19 pandemic through mass media and the internet (social network and online newspapers). Nearly 48% of them conceded that they communicated with customers when at least one person did not wear a face mask at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak. At medicine outlets, many measures were applied to protect pharmacists and customers, such as equipping pharmacists with face masks and hand sanitizers (95.0%), using glass shields (83.0%), and maintaining at least one-meter distance between two people (85.2%). CONCLUSION: The pharmacists’ knowledge of COVID-19 transmission, symptoms, and prevention was good. Many useful measures against the spread of this perilous virus were applied in medicine outlets. However, pharmacists should restrict forgetting to wear face masks in communication with medicine purchasers. The government and health agencies should have practical remedies to reduce the significant differences in the COVID-19 knowledge of pharmacists among provinces and education-level groups.","Nguyen, Huong Thi Thanh; Dinh, Dai Xuan; Nguyen, Van Minh",PLoS One,465,2

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), rotavirus (BoRV) and coronavirus (BoCV) are the main enteric pathogens involved. NCD is a major health challenge that impacts on farm profitability, calf welfare and antimicrobial usage. Thus, a key part of prevention is optimisation of preventive programs for NCD such as vaccinating cows to increase passive immunity transfer for their offspring during the neonatal period. In this study, it was demonstrated that dam vaccination against NCD is an excellent tool to increase specific immunity; how different vaccines differ in their specific immune response and, consequently, in the amount of specific passive transfer of antibodies to their calves. One of the most relevant findings is the importance of inducing a specific immune response for the three NCD pathogens. ABSTRACT: Neonatal calf diarrhoea (NCD) is a major health challenge with a negative impact on farm profitability, calf welfare and antimicrobial use. Neonatal calves are particularly sensitive to enteric infections. Thus, a key point for prevention is minimising infectious pressure and maximising specific immune responses. An amount of 120 dams not previously vaccinated against NCD were randomly allocated to one of three study groups: negative control versus two vaccinated groups (A and B). In the control group, the average level of antibodies was significantly low for both BoCV and ETEC (15.6 and 13.9% in the colostrum samples, respectively), demonstrating the importance of dam vaccination. Indeed, the level of specific immunity was significantly increased for BoCV and ETEC with dam vaccination using both one-shot vaccines versus the control group. Moreover, the statistical analysis revealed a significantly higher level of antibodies for BoCV and ETEC in colostrum samples in vaccine A versus vaccine B and the control group. In accordance, the calf serum demonstrated a significantly higher level and greater homogeneity of antibodies against BoCV and ETEC in the Vaccine A group versus other experimental groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, this study demonstrated a different specific immune response for the pathogens depending on the vaccine used to control NCD in cows.","Gonzalez, Román; Elvira, Laura; Carbonell, Carlos; Vertenten, Geert; Fraile, Lorenzo",Animals (Basel),465,28

However, little is known about how this pandemic could affect the more vulnerable population with severe mental illness. AIMS: To explore adolescent psychiatric inpatients’ perceptions, emotional reactions and needs during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Individual in-depth interviews were conducted with nine psychiatric inpatients aged 12–17 years. Through open-ended questions, interviewers initiated five themes: (a) knowledge about coronavirus pandemic, (b) changes in everyday routine due to the pandemic, (c) adolescents’ feelings about the pandemic, (d) adolescents’ positive thoughts and behaviors, and (e) how the social environment can help adolescents deal with the pandemic-related situation. A thematic analysis was conducted using line-by-line open coding. RESULTS: Regarding their knowledge of the impact of the current pandemic, almost all adolescents focused on information about the nature of coronavirus and on existing crisis management practices. Almost all patients identified predominantly negative changes due to the quarantine state, including restrictions on both social life and personal freedom as well as excessive contact with family members during home isolation. As far as their emotions were concerned, adolescents did acknowledge anxiety about self-harm and harming their loved ones as well as mood swings within the family nucleus; anxiety was also manifested about the unknown and the management of the pandemic in other countries. Avoidance of thought rumination about the coronavirus and its consequences, positive thinking and looking towards the future were reported as constructive strategies for coping with challenging emotions. Additionally, a sense of belongingness seems to have been playing a pivotal role in the adolescents coping strategies. Trust in the authorities and the community was another quite noteworthy point that emerged during the interviews. Lastly, our findings indicated adolescents’ benefit from receiving balanced health messaging coupled with balanced thinking within their social and family environment.

Here, we determined the expression of MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4), in lung tissues of smokers without airflow limitation and COPD patients in comparison to nonsmoking individuals (never-smokers). METHODS: DPP4 expression was measured in lung tissue of lung resection specimens of never-smokers, smokers without airflow limitation, COPD GOLD stage II patients and in lung explants of end-stage COPD patients. Both control subjects and COPD patients were well phenotyped and age-matched. The mRNA expression was determined using qRT-PCR and protein expression was quantified using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In smokers and subjects with COPD, both DPP4 mRNA and protein expression were significantly higher compared to never-smokers. Additionally, we found that both DPP4 mRNA and protein expression were inversely correlated with lung function and diffusing capacity parameters. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that DPP4 is upregulated in the lungs of smokers and COPD patients, which could partially explain why these individuals are more susceptible to MERS-CoV infection.

Complement activation generates membrane attack complex (MAC). MAC causes channel formation to the cell membrane of pathogen, leading to death of microorganisms. In the host, MAC also may induce channel formation to innocent bystander endothelial cells (ECs) and ECs cannot be protected. This provokes endotheliopathy, which activates two independent molecular pathways: inflammatory and microthrombotic. Activated inflammatory pathway promotes the release of inflammatory cytokines and triggers inflammation. Activated microthrombotic pathway mediates platelet activation and exocytosis of unusually large von Willebrand factor multimers (ULVWF) from ECs and initiates microthrombogenesis. Excessively released ULVWF become anchored to ECs as long elongated strings and recruit activated platelets to assemble platelet-ULVWF complexes and form “microthrombi”. These microthrombi strings trigger disseminated intravascular microthrombosis (DIT), which is the underlying pathology of endotheliopathy-associated vascular microthrombotic disease (EA-VMTD). Sepsis-induced endotheliopathy promotes inflammation and DIT. Inflammation produces inflammatory response and DIT orchestrates consumptive thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a combined phenotype of inflammation and endotheliopathy-associated (EA)-VMTD. Successful therapeutic design for sepsis can be achieved by counteracting the pathologic microthrombogenesis.","Chang, Jae C.",Thromb J,465,24

There is a danger that what we report will quickly become obsolete for numerous reasons; think of the speed of current technological progress or the fact that the Covid-19 pandemic could further stress health care systems around the world. However, we would like to outline some of the current topics explored in the literature and focus on the scenarios envisioned by practitioners. We write this piece being interested in the innovative impulses of all the actors belonging to the ""renewed"" health care ecosystem, aware of the fact that there are significant differences between the countries of the North and South of the world and, consequently, between their health care systems. What we can say with certainty is that the healthcare and life sciences are the protagonists of an unparalleled revolution. The aging population and changing needs, the increasingly common occurrence of chronic disorders, and digitization are some of the challenges facing the sector. The technological change of the fourth industrial revolution is disruptive and changes the logic of the market, not only that of healthcare but also that of adjacent markets. Because of the intensity with which insiders have to face these new trends, the topic has been the focus of interest of scholars and practitioners in recent years. The big players in consulting, as well as the scholars, have deepened the issues of healthcare of the future, focusing on what will be the major challenges in 10 years and imagining potential scenarios that will reconfigure the way health care is delivered and used. In the next 10 years, there will be profound demographic changes and the healthcare system will necessarily have to reconfigure the supply of the necessary services and the methods of delivery (KPMG, 2018). Due to the aging of the population, there has already been a dramatic increase in chronic and degenerative diseases requiring complex treatment in recent years. In addition, the Covid-19 pandemic that has been sweeping the world since 2019 has strained global health systems, revealed already existing weaknesses, even in the most advanced countries, and is representing an important moment of reflection for all policymakers. The whole world is questioning what will need to be done to foster greater effectiveness of national systems as well as better capacity to cope with shocks of such magnitude. In this document we explore what practitioners and scholars consider the main future challenges and the major changes that need to be made in the healthcare sector in order to embrace a new paradigm of care, based on the centrality of the patient, on prevention and not on cure, on technologies at the side of humans.","Schiavone, Francesco; Ferretti, Marco",Futures,465,10

Since December 2019, when this outbreak flared in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 cases have been continuously rising all over the world. Due to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 mutants, subsequent waves are flowing in a faster manner as compared to the primary wave, which is more contagious and causing higher mortality. Recently, India has emerged as the new epicenter of the second wave by mutants of SARS-CoV-2. After almost eighteen months of this outbreak, some COVID-19 dedicated therapeutics and vaccines are available, and a few are under trial, but the situation is still uncontrolled. AREA COVERED: This perspective article covers the repurposing of childhood vaccines like Bacille Calmette–Guerin (BCG), Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR), and Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), which are live attenuated vaccines and have been shown the protective effect through ‘trained immunity and ‘crossreactivity.' EXPERT OPINION: This perspective article has suggested that combinatorial use of these childhood vaccines might exert a better protective effect along with the available COVID-19 therapeutic and vaccines which could be considered as a preventive option against SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as its subsequent waves.","Sharma, Divakar",Expert Rev Vaccines,465,32

Intuitively, only a subset of people have the ability to practice remote work. However, there has been little research on the disparity of mobility adaptation across different income groups in US cities during the pandemic. The authors worked to fill this gap by quantifying the impacts of the pandemic on human mobility by income in Greater Houston, Texas. We determined human mobility using pseudonymized, spatially disaggregated cell phone location data. A longitudinal study across estimated income groups was conducted by measuring the total travel distance, radius of gyration, number of visited locations, and per-trip distance in April 2020 compared to the data in a baseline. An apparent disparity in mobility was found across estimated income groups. In particular, there was a strong negative correlation (ρ = −0.90) between a traveler’s estimated income and travel distance in April. Disparities in mobility adaptability were further shown since those in higher income brackets experienced larger percentage drops in the radius of gyration and the number of distinct visited locations than did those in lower income brackets. The findings of this study suggest a need to understand the reasons behind the mobility inflexibility among low-income populations during the pandemic. The study illuminates an equity issue which may be of interest to policy makers and researchers alike in the wake of an epidemic.","Iio, Kentaro; Guo, Xiaoyu; Kong, Xiaoqiang; Rees, Kelly; Bruce Wang, Xiubin",Transp Res Interdiscip Perspect,465,24

One practical and effective strategy is to implement rapid case identification based on a rapid testing to respond to this public health crisis. Currently, the available technologies used for rapid diagnostics include RT-PCR, RT-LAMP, ELISA and NGS. Still, due to their different limitations, they are not well suited for rapid diagnosis in a variety of locations. Paper-based devices are alternative approaches to achieve rapid diagnosis, which are cost-effective, highly selective, sensitive, portable, and easy-to-use. In addition to individual virus screening, wastewater-based epidemiology has been emerged to be an effective way for early warning of outbreak within the population, which tests genomic viral sequence to reflect information on the spread and distribution of the virus because SARS-CoV-2 can be shed into wastewater through the feces and urine from infected population. In this paper, we describe paper-based device as a low-cost and rapid sensor for testing of virus for both diagnosis and early warning of outbreak for wastewater-based epidemiology. Most importantly, the device has great potential for real-time detection in the field, without any advanced facilities and well-trained skilled personnel, and provides early warning or timely intervention of an outbreak of pandemic.","Hui, Qingxin; Pan, Yuwei; Yang, Zhugen",,465,24

The lack of efficacious drugs and vaccines against this viral infection created a challenge for scientific researchers in order to find effective solutions. One of the promising therapeutic approaches is the search for bioactive molecules with few side effects that display antiviral properties in natural sources like medicinal plants and vegetables. Several computational and experimental studies indicated that flavonoids especially flavonols and their derivatives constitute effective viral enzyme inhibitors and possess interesting antiviral activities. In this context, the present study reviews the efficacy of many dietary flavonols as potential antiviral drugs targeting the SARS-CoV-2 enzymes and proteins including Chymotrypsin-Like Protease (3CL(pro)), Papain Like protease (PL(pro)), Spike protein (S protein) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and also their ability to interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor. The relationship between flavonol structures and their SARS-CoV-2 antiviral effects were discussed. On the other hand, the immunomodulatory, the anti-inflammatory and the antiviral effects of secondary metabolites from this class of flavonoids were reported.

Peritraumatic distress (PD) and post-traumatic stress disorder have been reported after traumatic events, but the specific effect of the pandemic is not well known. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess PD in France, a country where COVID-19 had such a dramatic impact that it required a country-wide lockdown. METHODS: We recruited patients in four groups of chatbot users followed for breast cancer, asthma, depression and migraine. We used the Psychological Distress Inventory (PDI), a validated scale to measure PD during traumatic events, and correlated PD risk with patients’ characteristics in order to better identify the ones who were the most at risk. RESULTS: The study included 1771 participants. 91.25% (n=1616) were female with a mean age of 32.8 (13.71) years and 7.96% (n=141) were male with a mean age of 28.0 (8.14) years. In total, 38.06% (n=674) of the respondents had psychological distress (PDI ≥14). An analysis of variance showed that unemployment and depression were significantly associated with a higher PDI score. Patients using their smartphones or computers for more than 1 hour a day also had a higher PDI score (p=0.026). CONCLUSION: Prevalence of PD in at-risk patients is high. These patients are also at an increased risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder. Specific steps should be implemented to monitor and prevent PD through dedicated mental health policies if we want to limit the public health impact of COVID-19 in time.

Diagnosticians often read Romanowsky‐stained cytology, although specific techniques such as immunocytochemistry are often essential for a definitive diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: The goal of the present study aimed to investigate if immunocytochemistry on previously‐stained cytologic specimens was possible. Different pretreatments were examined to determine which treatment preserved antigenicity best. METHODS: One hundred and twenty‐two impression smears and 64 fine‐needle aspirate preparations of brain and lymph nodes were processed and evaluated microscopically. The impact of staining cytologic preparations with a modified Wright's stain, using a destaining method, performing a coverslipping and decoverslipping process, and subjecting smears to a microwave treatment (MWT) were examined for the immunolabeling of selected nuclear, cytoplasmic, and plasmalemmal antigens, as well as intracellular feline coronavirus (FCoV). Biotinylated secondary antibodies were used, and the bound primary antibody was visualized using an ABC amplification kit. RESULTS: Cellular antigens were reliably detected with immunocytochemistry after smears were stained with a Romansky stain and were coverslipped early after staining and stayed coverslipped until immediately before immunolabeling. The staining intensity reached the same levels as that of the controls if the films underwent MWT in citrate buffer. In contrast, FCoV antigen detection was abolished after any physicochemical interference. CONCLUSIONS: Poststaining immunocytochemistry represents a practical tool for additional investigations on prestained cytologic specimens when searching for cellular antigens. Paired untreated samples should be kept in case the workup requires testing for more vulnerable viral antigens.","Dörfelt, Stefanie; Matiasek, Lara A.; Felten, Sandra; Sangl, Laura; Hartmann, Katrin; Matiasek, Kaspar",Vet Clin Pathol,465,11

Morbidity and mortality can be considerable on a farm with huge economic consequences for the farmer as well as compromised welfare for the mink kits. Although efforts have been taken to identify etiologic agents involved in outbreaks, the syndrome is still regarded as multifactorial and recurring problems on the same farms draw attention to management and environmental risk factors. In the pre-weaning period from May to June 2015, a case control study was carried out on 30 Danish mink farms. Data concerning management, biosecurity, hygiene, feed consumption, antibacterial prescription and production efficiency were analyzed. RESULTS: The proportion of 1-year old females, farm size (total number of females), energy supply per female in the late gestation period, and dogs accessing the farm area were significantly associated with being a case farm. Case farms were prescribed almost twice the amount of antibacterials per gestational unit (female and litter) as in control farms. Farmers on case farms spent significantly more time nursing and treating the animals and experienced more females with mastitis compared to farmers on control farms. No significant differences in cleaning practices or hygienic measures between case and control farms were found and there were no differences in drinking water quality, bedding material, composition neither of color types nor in management regarding litter equalization. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study showed an association between the occurrence of pre-weaning diarrhea on mink farms and parity profile, farm size and feeding intensity in the gestational period. The access of dogs to the farm area was a significant risk factor, but needs further clarification.

Previous research on the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal, to a certain extent, ignored or simplified the structure of dissemination networks and users’ cognition as well as decision-making and interaction behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to roughly evaluate the effectiveness of rumor rebuttal; dig deeply into the attitude-based echo chamber effect on users’ responses to rumor rebuttal under multiple topics on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic; and evaluate the echo chamber’s impact on the information characteristics of user interaction content. METHODS: We used Sina Weibo’s application programming interface to crawl rumor rebuttal content related to COVID-19 from 10 AM on January 23, 2020, to midnight on April 8, 2020. Using content analysis, sentiment analysis, social network analysis, and statistical analysis, we first analyzed whether and to what extent there was an echo chamber effect on the shaping of individuals’ attitudes when retweeting or commenting on others’ tweets. Then, we tested the heterogeneity of attitude distribution within communities and the homophily of interactions between communities. Based on the results at user and community levels, we made comprehensive judgments. Finally, we examined users’ interaction content from three dimensions—sentiment expression, information seeking and sharing, and civility—to test the impact of the echo chamber effect. RESULTS: Our results indicated that the retweeting mechanism played an essential role in promoting polarization, and the commenting mechanism played a role in consensus building. Our results showed that there might not be a significant echo chamber effect on community interactions and verified that, compared to like-minded interactions, cross-cutting interactions contained significantly more negative sentiment, information seeking and sharing, and incivility. We found that online users’ information-seeking behavior was accompanied by incivility, and information-sharing behavior was accompanied by more negative sentiment, which was often accompanied by incivility. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed the existence and degree of an echo chamber effect from multiple dimensions, such as topic, interaction mechanism, and interaction level, and its impact on interaction content. Based on these findings, we provide several suggestions for preventing or alleviating group polarization to achieve better rumor rebuttal.","Wang, Dandan; Qian, Yuxing",J Med Internet Res,465,16

The purpose of the present study was to shed light on the transformation processes of umifenovir in municipal wastewater, including disinfection with active chlorine, as well as to assess the levels of the antiviral drug and its metabolites entering and accumulating in natural reservoirs under conditions of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The combination of high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization high-resolution mass-spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used for tentative identification and quantification of umifenovir and its transformation products in model reaction mixtures and real samples of wastewater, river water, biological sludge and bottom sediments taken at the wastewater treatment plant in Arkhangelsk, a large cultural and industrial center at the Russian North. Laboratory experiments allowed identifying fifteen bromine-containing transformation products, forming at the initial stages of the chlorination and fourteen classic volatile and semi volatile disinfection by-products with bromoform as the dominant one. Chlorinated derivatives are only the minor disinfection by-products forming by substitution of alkylamine group in the aromatic ring. The schemes of umifenovir transformation in reactions with dissolved oxygen and sodium hypochlorite are proposed. Two established primary transformation products formed by oxidation of the thioether group to sulfoxide and elimination of thiophenol were detected in noticeable concentrations in the wastewater together with their precursor. The level of umifenovir reached 1.3 mg kg(−1) in the sludge and municipal wastewater treat contained 1 μg L(−1) of that drug, while its removal during biological wastewater treatment was about 40%. Pronounced accumulation of umifenovir and its transformation products in biological sludge and bottom sediments of natural reservoirs may be a source of the future secondary pollution of the environment.","Ul'yanovskii, Nikolay V.; Kosyakov, Dmitry S.; Sypalov, Sergey A.; Varsegov, Ilya S.; Shavrina, Irina S.; Lebedev, Albert T.",Sci Total Environ,465,1

Participants (N = 723) completed a battery of questionnaires including the Mental Toughness Questionnaire 48-item, The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale – 21 items. Participants reported relatively higher levels of depression, stress and anxiety in comparison to pre-COVID-19 samples from previous research, with respondents who had lost their jobs during the pandemic reporting higher levels of negative affective states. Despite this, mentally tough individuals appeared to report lower levels of depression, anxiety and stress. Moreover, moderation analyses identified some interaction between MT and employment status when predicting depression, anxiety and stress. Our findings suggest that MT may have some utility in reducing the adverse mental health effects of the pandemic on individuals, however, further longitudinal research is needed to support these implications.","Mojtahedi, Dara; Dagnall, Neil; Denovan, Andrew; Clough, Peter; Hull, Sophie; Canning, Derry; Lilley, Caroline; Papageorgiou, Kostas A.",Front Psychiatry,465,20

Currently, diagnosis of severe HAdV pneumonia in children is hampered by the lack of specific biomarkers. Also, the severity of adenovirus pneumonia in pediatric patients is generally based on clinical features and existing biomarkers do not reliably correlate to clinical severity. Here, we asked whether local and systemic inflammatory mediators could act as biomarkers predicting severe HAdV pneumonia in children. METHODS: Totally 37 common inflammatory protein levels were determined by Luminex assay in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from pediatric patients who were diagnosed with HAdV pneumonia, and their correlation with the disease severity and lung lesion were assessed using statistical and bioinformatic analysis. RESULTS: Among 37 inflammatory cytokines, the protein levels of 4 TNF superfamily (TNFSF) members and their receptors (TNF receptor superfamily, TNFRSF) [TNFSF13B, TNFSF14, sTNF-R1 and sTNF-R2] in the plasma and 7 TNFSF/TNFRSF members [TNFSF12, TNFSF13, TNFSF13B, TNFSF14, TNFRSF8, sTNF-R1, and sTNF-R2] in the BAL were enhanced in patients with HAdV pneumonia compared with control subjects with airway foreign body. Moreover, the protein levels of all the tested TNFSF/TNFRSF members (except TNFSF12) were elevated in the BAL of severe group compared with non-severe HAdV pneumonia patients, while only TNFSF13B and TNFSF14 were dramatically increased in the plasma of severe cases, and positively related to the plasma CRP levels. In addition, ROC analysis indicated that TNFSF13B and TNFSF14 displayed a great potential to predict severe HAdV pneumonia. CONCLUSION: In pediatric HAdV pneumonia, TNFSF/TNFRSF members function as key molecules in local and systemic inflammatory network, and the plasma TNFSF13B and TNFSF14 may be the potential local and systemic inflammatory indicators of severe HAdV pneumonia in pediatric patients.","Fan, Huifeng; Lu, Bingtai; Cao, Can; Li, Hui; Yang, Diyuan; Huang, Li; Ding, Tao; Wu, Minhao; Lu, Gen",Front Immunol,465,1

It is also the cellular point of contact for the coronavirus spike protein. Cleavage of the receptor is both important to its physiological function as well as being necessary for cell entry by the virus. Shedding of ACE2 by the metalloprotease ADAM17 releases a catalytically active soluble form of ACE2, but cleavage by the serine protease TMPRSS2 is necessary for virion internalization. Complicating the issue is the observation that circulating ACE2 can also bind to the virus effectively blocking attachment to the membrane-bound receptor. This work investigates the possibility that the inflammatory response to coronavirus infection can abrogate shedding by ADAM17, thereby favoring cleavage by TMPRSS2 and thus cell entry by the virion.","Healy, Eamonn F.; Lilic, Marko",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,465,24

However, the advantages and challenges of RDD for CT have not yet been investigated from the perspective of public health professionals (PHPs). Therefore, it remains unclear if, and under what circumstances, PHPs are willing to apply RDD for CT. METHODS: Between March and April 2019, we conducted semi-structured interviews with Dutch PHPs responsible for CT in practice. Questions were derived from the ‘diffusion of innovations’ theory. Between May and June 2019, we distributed an online questionnaire among 260 Dutch PHPs to quantify the main qualitative findings. Using different hypothetical scenarios, we assessed anticipated advantages and challenges of RDD, and PHPs’ intention to apply RDD for CT. RESULTS: Twelve interviews were held, and 70 PHPs completed the online questionnaire. A majority of questionnaire respondents (71%) had a positive intention towards using RDD for CT. Anticipated advantages of RDD were ‘accommodating easy and autonomous participation in CT of index cases and contact persons’, and ‘reaching contact persons more efficiently’. Anticipated challenges were ‘limited opportunities for PHPs to support, motivate, and coordinate the execution of CT’, ‘not being able to adequately convey measures to index cases and contact persons’, and ‘anticipated unrest among index cases and contact persons’. Circumstances under which PHPs anticipated RDD applicable for CT included index cases and contact persons being reluctant to share information directly with PHPs, digitally skilled and literate persons being involved, and large scale CT. Circumstances under which PHPs anticipated RDD less applicable for CT included severe consequences of missing information or contact persons for individual or public health, involvement of complex or impactful measures for index cases and contact persons, and a disease being perceived as severe or sensitive by index cases and their contact persons. CONCLUSIONS: PHPs generally perceived RDD as a potentially beneficial method for public health practice, that may help overcome challenges present in traditional CT, and could be used during outbreaks of infectious diseases that spread via close contact. The circumstances under which CT is performed, appear to strongly influence PHPs’ intention to use RDD for CT.

The eight‐item adult version of the ELCSA was translated from English to Sinhala and Tamil. Cognitive testing (on 10 pregnant women and five local experts) and psychometric validation of the self‐administered HFI tool were conducted among pregnant women (n = 269) attending the special clinics of the Rajarata Pregnancy Cohort (RaPCo) in Anuradhapura in February 2020. We assessed the psychometric properties and fit using a one parameter logistic model (Rasch model analysis) using STATA Version 14 and WINSTEP software Version 4.3.4. Concurrent validity was tested using psychological distress. The scale was internally consistent (Cronbach's alpha = 0.79) and had a good model fit (Rasch items infit statistic range: 0.85 to 1.07). Item 8 (‘did not eat for the whole day’) was removed from the model fit analysis, as it was not affirmed by respondent. Item severity scores ranged from −2.15 for ‘not eating a diverse diet’ to 4.43 for ‘not eating during the whole day’. Concurrent validity between HFI and psychological distress was confirmed (r = 0.15, p < 0.05). The self‐applied version of ELCSA‐pregnancy in Sri Lanka (ELCSA‐P‐SL) is a valid and feasible valid tool.

Other times, the shared control of participatory medicine is both an ethical and clinical imperative. However, as the worldwide toll exacted by COVID-19 has made us grimly aware, no one is really in control.

However, in almost 40 years of HIV research, few interventions have been developed directly by and for these priority populations in domestic counties most at risk. We submit that interventions developed by early-career scientists who identify with and work directly with affected subgroups, and which include social and structural determinants of health, are vital as culturally tailored HIV prevention and care tools. METHODS: We reviewed and summarized interventions developed from 2007 to 2020 by historically underrepresented early-career HIV prevention scientists in a federally funded research mentoring program. We mapped these interventions to determine which were in jurisdictions deemed as high priority (based on HIV burden) by national prevention strategies. RESULTS: We summarized 11 HIV interventions; 10 (91%) of the 11 interventions are in geographic areas where HIV disparities are most concentrated and where new HIV prevention and care activities are focused. Each intervention addresses critical social and structural determinants of health disparities, and successfully reaches priority populations. CONCLUSION: Focused funding that supports historically underrepresented scientists and their HIV prevention and care intervention research can help facilitate reaching national goals to reduce HIV-related disparities and end the HIV epidemic. Maintaining these funding streams should remain a priority as one of the tools for national HIV prevention.","Sutton, Madeline Y.; Martinez, Omar; Brawner, Bridgette M.; Prado, Guillermo; Camacho-Gonzalez, Andres; Estrada, Yannine; Payne-Foster, Pamela; Rodriguez-Diaz, Carlos E.; Hussen, Sophia A.; Lanier, Yzette; van den Berg, Jacob J.; Malavé-Rivera, Souhail M.; Hickson, DeMarc A.; Fields, Errol L.",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,465,17

METHODS: In June 2018, all UK radiology department audit leads were sent a questionnaire designed to assess compliance for each standard of the Royal College of Radiologists published guidance on providing seven-day acute care. RESULTS: 135 hospitals (68%) responded. Of those that responded, 96% of departments have a diagnostic radiologist rota for clinicians to discuss acute cases and review imaging and 48% of departments do not have a fully staffed consultant rota 24 h a day, seven days a week for interventional radiology. There is significant variance in MRI radiographer availability within departments, ranging from 18.8% during Saturday/Sunday evening/overnight up to a maximum of 63.9% during Saturday daytime. 11% of departments participate in a regional out of hours cross-organisation reporting rota. 40% of departments have no 24/7 RIS technical support and 34% have no PACS technical support out of hours. CONCLUSION: There is a wide variation in practice across radiology departments in the UK. Although there are some standards that the majority of hospitals are achieving, there is a significant short-fall in fundamental aspects of providing acute seven-day care. The multifactorial nature in which these problems have arisen means there is no easy solution to combat these issues. There is a requirement for significant investment and political commitment to improve staffing and infrastructure in order to address the current situation. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: A UK wide evaluation of the current provision of seven-day working in radiology showing 54% of hospitals do not have a UK working-time regulations compliant Interventional radiology rota, severe lack of availability of acute MRI out of hours and significant deficiencies in providing technical support out of hours.

The delivery, management, and coordination of nursing care services, provided via telecommunications technology, is a convenient method of delivering health care to patients recovering from stroke. It is important to assess the service quality of the telehealth process and to establish the role of telehealth nursing and related technologies in the care of patients recovering from stroke. Studies show that even though both health professionals and participants have reported high levels of satisfaction and acceptance of telerehabilitation interventions, the quality of the evidence on telerehabilitation in poststroke care remains low. Conducting a quality study of telehealth rehabilitation for patients recovering from stroke will help assess if home health agencies with telehealth capabilities caring for patients recovering from stroke and patients with chronic diseases can provide quality care to patients in their home and fill this health care gap. Patients that are severely handicapped and impaired and unable to reside in their home environment are not included in telerehabilitation services provided by the home care agency. It would be informative to study the benefits of telerehabilitation and the care provided to patients recovering from stroke within nursing homes, given the need for social distancing to reduce disease transmission during the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global health pandemic.

Similar concerns, such as those associated with poverty, impair performance on cognitive control tasks. If ongoing concerns about COVID-19 substantially increase the tendency to mind wander in tasks requiring sustained attention, these worries could degrade performance on a wide range of tasks, leading, for example, to increased traffic accidents, diminished educational achievement, and lower workplace productivity. In two pre-registered experiments, we investigated the degree to which young adults’ concerns about COVID-19 correlated with their ability to sustain attention. Experiment 1 tested mainly European participants during an early phase of the pandemic. After completing a survey probing COVID-related concerns, participants engaged in a continuous performance task (CPT) over two, 4-min blocks, during which they responded to city scenes that occurred 90% of the time and withheld responses to mountain scenes that occurred 10% of the time. Despite large and stable individual differences, performance on the scene CPT did not significantly correlate with the severity of COVID-related concerns obtained from the survey. Experiment 2 tested US participants during a later phase of the pandemic. Once again, CPT performance did not significantly correlate with COVID concerns expressed in a pre-task survey. However, participants who had more task-unrelated thoughts performed more poorly on the CPT. These findings suggest that although COVID-19 increased anxiety in a broad swath of society, young adults are able to hold these concerns in a latent format, minimizing their impact on performance in a demanding sustained attention task.

During the past few years, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods have been developed for many pathogens causing respiratory tract infections. The aim of this study was to determine the etiology of CAP among adults—especially the occurrence of mixed infections among patients with CAP—by implementing a new diagnostic PCR platform combined with conventional methods. METHODS: Adults admitted to Karolinska University Hospital were studied prospectively during a 12-month period. Microbiological testing methods included culture from blood, sputum, and nasopharyngeal secretion samples; sputum samples analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis; nasopharyngeal specimens analyzed by use of PCR; serological testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and viruses common in the respiratory tract; and urine antigen assays for detection of pneumococcal and Legionella pneumophila antigens. RESULTS: A microbial etiology could be identified for 67% of the patients (n = 124). For patients with complete sampling, a microbiological agent was identified for 89% of the cases. The most frequently detected pathogens were S. pneumoniae (70 patients [38]) and respiratory virus (53 patients [29]). Two or more pathogens were present in 43 (35%) of 124 cases with a determined etiology. CONCLUSIONS: By supplementing traditional diagnostic methods with new PCR-based methods, a high microbial yield was achieved. This was especially evident for patients with complete sampling.

In this study, we investigated the role of sociodemographic and COVID-19 related factors for immediate mental health consequences in a nationwide community sample of adults from Germany (N = 4335). Specifically, we examined the effects of different forms and levels of restriction resulting from public health measures (e.g. quarantine, stay-at-home order) on anxiety and depression symptomatology, health anxiety, loneliness, the occurrence of fearful spells, psychosocial distress and life-satisfaction. We found that higher restrictions due to lockdown measures, a greater reduction of social contacts and greater perceived changes in life were associated with higher mental health impairments. Importantly, a subjectively assumed but not an officially announced stay-at-home order was associated with poorer mental health. Our findings underscore the importance of adequate risk communication and targeted mental health recommendations especially for vulnerable groups during these challenging times.","Benke, Christoph; Autenrieth, Lara K.; Asselmann, Eva; Pané-Farré, Christiane A.",Psychiatry Res,465,20

In addition, and despite that aging is regarded as an independent risk factor for the severe form of the disease, even so, women protection is evident. In this way, it has been expected that sex hormones are the main determinant factors in gender differences, with the immunomodulatory effects of estrogen in different viral infections, chiefly in Covid-19, attracting more attention as it might explain the case-fatality rate and predisposition of men for Covid-19 severity. Here, we aim to provide a mini-review and an overview on the protective effects of estrogen in Covid-19.

One of the most popular and complex deep learning in finance topics is future stock prediction. The difficulty that causes the future stock forecast is that there are too many different factors that affect the amplitude and frequency of the rise and fall of stocks at the same time. Some of the company-specific factors that can affect the share price like news releases on earnings and profits, future estimated earnings, the announcement of dividends, introduction of a new product or a product recall, secure a new large contract, employee layoffs, a major change of management, anticipated takeover or merger, and accounting errors or scandals. Furthermore, these factors are only company factors, and other factors affect the future trend of stocks, such as industry performance, investor sentiment, and economic factors. This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach to predict future stock movement. The model employs a blending ensemble learning method to combine two recurrent neural networks, followed by a fully connected neural network. In our research, we use the S&P 500 Index as our test case. Our experiments show that our blending ensemble deep learning model outperforms the best existing prediction model substantially using the same dataset, reducing the mean-squared error from 438.94 to 186.32, a 57.55% reduction, increasing precision rate by 40%, recall by 50%, F1-score by 44.78%, and movement direction accuracy by 33.34%, respectively.

CONCLUSION: POC-BG monitoring is very commonly used in intensive care unit settings to monitor BG as they are minimally invasive, convenient, and quick. However, physicians and nurses need to be aware that certain substances can interfere with and alter POC-BG levels, leading to incorrect diagnosis of pseudohyperglycemia or pseudohypoglycemia. This may potentially lead to catastrophic consequences and result in increased morbidity and mortality in intensive care unit settings. The Food and Drug Administration advises against the use of POC-BG meters in critical settings, and they should never be used to diagnose DKA.","Orija, Israel B.; Zahid, Syeda Hira",AACE Clin Case Rep,465,24

Existing research has focused on discrimination against Asians and is primarily based on self-reported incidents or nonrepresentative samples. We investigate the extent to which COVID-19 has fueled prejudice and discrimination against multiple racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States by examining nationally representative survey data with an embedded vignette experiment about roommate selection (collected in August 2020; n = 5,000). We find that priming COVID-19 salience has an immediate, statistically significant impact: compared to the control group, respondents in the treatment group exhibited increased prejudice and discriminatory intent against East Asian, South Asian, and Hispanic hypothetical room-seekers. The treatment effect is more pronounced in increasing extreme negative attitudes toward the three minority groups than decreasing extreme positive attitudes toward them. This is partly due to the treatment increasing the proportion of respondents who perceive these minority groups as extremely culturally incompatible (Asians and Hispanics) and extremely irresponsible (Asians). Sociopolitical factors did not moderate the treatment effects on attitudes toward Asians, but prior social contact with Hispanics mitigated prejudices against them. These findings suggest that COVID-19-fueled prejudice and discrimination have not been limited to East Asians but are part of a broader phenomenon that has affected Asians generally and Hispanics as well.","Lu, Yao; Kaushal, Neeraj; Huang, Xiaoning; Gaddis, S Michael",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,465,1

METHODS: This multicenter, randomized, blinded, non-inferiority-controlled trial compared two methods of teaching basic neonatal resuscitation skills using mask ventilation. Groups of novice providers watched an instructional video. One group received instructor facilitation (Ins-Video). The other group did not (Self-Video). An Objective Structured Clinical Exam (OSCE) measured skills performance, and a written test gauged knowledge. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-four students completed the study. Sixty-three of 68 in the Self-Video Group (92.6%) and 59 of 66 in the Ins-Video Group (89.4%) achieved post-training competency in positive pressure ventilation (primary outcome). OSCE passing rates were low in both groups. Knowledge survey scores were comparable between groups and non-inferior.

Pressure pulses, based on the principle of vibration in pipes are used for pipeline monitoring in this study. The principle of time delay between pulse arrivals at sensor positions is also adopted in this study. An Arduino and a Wi-Fi module were combined, programmed and used to produce a wireless communication device which communicates with the ThingSpeak internet of things (IoT) analytics platform. A total of five channels were created on the platform to collect data from the five sensors that were used in the experimental test rig that made use of wireless communication device. Signal data was collected once every 15 s and all the channels were updated every 2 min. ThingSpeak provided instant visualizations of data posted by the wireless communication device. Online analysis and processing of the data was performed as it came in. A second test rig was built that made use of a data logger for processing of data. The measured velocity of pulse propagation using the data logger and air as transport fluid was 355 m/s. The computed estimates of event location for the 50 measurements taken ranged between 4.243 m and 4.246 m. This had a scatter of just 3 mm against the actual measured event location of 4.23 m. The experimental results obtained showed that the performance of the wireless communication device compared satisfactorily with the data logger and is capable of detecting the location of damage on real pipelines when used for real time monitoring. Using this communication device and an analytics platform, real-time monitoring of pipelines can be carried out from any location in the world on any internet-enabled device.","Aba, E.

In this paper, we argue that the formation of a disrupting science identity that challenges existing constructed systems of power in science, requires robust understandings of NOS that place emphasis on the socially-produced narratives about science and scientists. In doing so, we engage with the following questions: (a) How have understandings of NOS contributed to conceptualizations of who can be a scientist and who is recognized as a scientist? (b) How have these conceptualizations contributed to producing exclusionary narratives and perpetuating inequalities in science? and, (c) How might an exploration of NOS through the lens of science identity be used to promote goals related to equity and social justice?","Avraamidou, Lucy; Schwartz, Renee",Cult Stud Sci Educ,465,23

Widespread use of face coverings has revealed challenges such as mask contamination and waste, presenting an opportunity to improve the current technologies. In response, we have developed the Auto-sanitizing Retractable Mask Optimized for Reusability (ARMOR). ARMOR is a novel, reusable face covering that can be quickly disinfected using an array of ultraviolet C lamps contained within a wearable case. A nanomembrane UVC sensor was used to quantify the intensity of germicidal radiation at 18 different locations on the face covering and determine the necessary exposure time to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in addition to other viruses and bacteria. After experimentation, it was found that ARMOR successfully provided germicidal radiation to all areas of the mask and will inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in approximately 180 s, H1N1 Influenza in 130 s, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 113 s, proving that this design is effective at eliminating a variety of pathogens and can serve as an alternative to traditional waste-producing disposable face masks. The accessibility, ease of use, and speed of sanitization supports the wide application of ARMOR in both clinical and public settings.","Crawford, Matthew J.; Ramezani, Sepehr; Jabbari, Roghaie; Pathak, Pawan; Cho, Hyoung J.; Kim, Brian N.; Choi, Hwan",Sci Rep,465,16

However, there are concerns about the overall strength of COVID-19 impact evaluation studies given the circumstances for evaluation and concerns about the publication environment. This study systematically reviewed the strength of evidence in the published COVID-19 policy impact evaluation literature. METHODS: We included studies that were primarily designed to estimate the quantitative impact of one or more implemented COVID-19 policies on direct SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 outcomes. After searching PubMed for peer-reviewed articles published on November 26 or earlier and screening, all studies were reviewed by three reviewers first independently and then to consensus. The review tool was based on previously developed and release review guidance for COVID-19 policy impact evaluation, assessing what impact evaluation method was used, graphical display of outcomes data, functional form for the outcomes, timing between policy and impact, concurrent changes to the outcomes, and an overall rating. RESULTS: After 102 articles were identified as potentially meeting inclusion criteria, we identified 36 published articles that evaluated the quantitative impact of COVID-19 policies on direct COVID-19 outcomes. The majority (n=23/36) of studies in our sample examined the impact of stay-at-home requirements. Nine studies were set aside because the study design was considered inappropriate for COVID-19 policy impact evaluation (n=8 pre/post; n=1 cross-section), and 27 articles were given a full consensus assessment. 20/27 met criteria for graphical display of data, 5/27 for functional form, 19/27 for timing between policy implementation and impact, and only 3/27 for concurrent changes to the outcomes. Only 1/27 studies passed all of the above checks, and 4/27 were rated as overall appropriate. Including the 9 studies set aside, reviewers found that only four of the 36 identified published and peer-reviewed health policy impact evaluation studies passed a set of key design checks for identifying the causal impact of policies on COVID-19 outcomes. DISCUSSION: The reviewed literature directly evaluating the impact of COVID-19 policies largely failed to meet key design criteria for useful inference. This was largely driven by the circumstances under which policies were passed making it difficult to attribute changes in COVID-19 outcomes to particular policies. More reliable evidence review is needed to both identify and produce policy-actionable evidence, alongside the recognition that actionable evidence is often unlikely to be feasible.","Haber, Noah A.; Clarke-Deelder, Emma; Feller, Avi; Smith, Emily R.; Salomon, Joshua; MacCormack-Gelles, Benjamin; Stone, Elizabeth M.; Bolster-Foucault, Clara; Daw, Jamie R.; Hatfield, Laura A.; Fry, Carrie E.; Boyer, Christopher B.; Ben-Michael, Eli; Joyce, Caroline M.; Linas, Beth S.; Schmid, Ian; Au, Eric H.; Wieten, Sarah E.; Jarrett, Brooke A; Axfors, Cathrine; Nguyen, Van Thu; Griffin, Beth Ann; Bilinski, Alyssa; Stuart, Elizabeth A.",medRxiv,465,22

METHODS: A cross-sectional study. A total of 135 hearing-impaired individuals using hearing aids (study group) and 125 healthy individuals (control group) participated. The Turkish versions of the Acute Stress Symptoms Scale (ASSS) and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) were applied to all participants. The Turkish version of Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap (T-AIADH) was also applied to the study group in addition to other scales. The presence of any difference between the groups in terms of ASSS and BRS scores was investigated. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the control group and the study group in terms of ASSS results (Z = -4.4, P = .00). No statistically significant difference was found between the control group and the study group in terms of BRS scores (Z = -0.248, P = .804). Furthermore, T-AIADH scale was observed not to correlate either with ASSS or BRS (P > .05). In the study group, the change in income level after the pandemic, age and sex variables were determined as a significant predictor of ASSS. CONCLUSION: Identifying risks and protective factors for hearing-impaired individuals at the early stage of the epidemic is considered to be of critical importance to predict the psychological impact of both the epidemic and the response to the COVID-19 health crisis and to reduce stress.","Kaya, Sule; Deniz Senli, Fahrettin; Mecit, Hilal; Kagitcibasi, Betul; Karabulut, Mustafa",Int J Clin Pract,465,10

Subjective feelings of loneliness, but not the size of the social network accounted for poor mental health. Women were especially at increased risk for mental health problems. Thus, despite effective mitigation of the pandemic, there was a striking deterioration of mental health. As the psychological burden of the continuing pandemic accrues, the probability of an impending mental health crisis is increasing, especially in countries with greater infection and death rates than South Korea.

In its simplest form, the Poletti model adds one differential equation, motivated by evolutionary game theory, to the SIR model. The new equation describes the evolution of a variable x that represents the fraction of the population following normal behavior. The remaining fraction [Formula: see text] uses altered behavior such as staying home, social isolation, mask wearing, etc. Normal behavior offers a higher payoff when the number of infectives is low; altered behavior offers a higher payoff when the number is high. We show that the entry–exit function of geometric singular perturbation theory can be used to analyze the model in the limit in which behavior changes on a much faster time scale than that of the epidemic. In particular, behavior does not change as soon as a different behavior has a higher payoff; current behavior is sticky. The delay until behavior changes is predicted by the entry–exit function.","Schecter, Stephen",J Math Biol,465,6

The recent COVID-19 pandemic also highlights the increased susceptibility of the elderly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a diffuse inflammatory lung injury with often long-term effects (ie parenchymal fibrosis). Collectively, these lung conditions are characterized by a pathogenic reparative process that, rather than restoring organ function, contributes to structural and functional tissue decline. In the ageing lung, the homeostatic control of wound healing following challenge or injury has an increased likelihood of being perturbed, increasing susceptibility to disease. This loss of fidelity is a consequence of a diverse range of underlying ageing mechanisms including senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction, proteostatic stress and diminished autophagy that occur within the lung, as well as in other tissues, organs and systems of the body. These ageing pathways are highly interconnected, involving localized and systemic increases in inflammatory mediators and damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs); along with corresponding changes in immune cell function, metabolism and composition of the pulmonary and gut microbiomes. Here we comprehensively review the roles of ageing mechanisms in the tissue remodeling of lung disease.","Schuliga, Michael; Read, Jane; Knight, Darryl A",Ageing Res Rev,465,1

In an observational population-based study in Norway (pop ≥ 5 years, 2009–2017) covering six years post-PCV13 implementation, we explored the incidence and risk of IPD associated with age and comorbidities. We obtained the data on 5535 IPD cases from the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases and the population data from Statistics Norway. To define comorbidities, we obtained ICD-10 codes from the Norwegian Patient Registry for the cases and the Norwegian population. The average annual decrease in PCV13 IPD incidence was significant in all risk groups and decreased post-PCV13 introduction by 16–20% per risk group, implying a nondifferential indirect protection from the childhood vaccination. The IPD incidence remained high in the medical risk groups. The relative importance of medical risk conditions was 2.8 to 6 times higher in those aged 5–64 versus ≥65 years for all types of IPD, since age itself is a risk factor for IPD. In groups without medical risk, the risk of IPD was eight times higher in those aged ≥65 compared to those 5–64 years (RR 8.3 (95% CI 7.3–9.5)).

Up to March 3, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 89,000 people in China and other 66 countries across six continents. In this study, we used 10 new sequenced genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and combined 136 genomes from GISAID database to investigate the genetic variation and population demography through different analysis approaches (e.g. Network, EBSP, Mismatch, and neutrality tests). The results showed that 80 haplotypes had 183 substitution sites, including 27 parsimony-informative and 156 singletons. Sliding window analyses of genetic diversity suggested a certain mutations abundance in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2, which may be explaining the existing widespread and high adaptation of the deadly virus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the view, pangolin acted as an intermediate host, may be controversial. The network indicated that, in the original haplotype (H14), one patient sample lived near the Huanan seafood market (approximate 2 km), indicating high possibility of the patient having a history of unconscious contact with this market. However, based on this clue, we cannot accurately concluded that whether this market was the origin center of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, 16 genomes, collected from this market, assigned to 10 haplotypes, indicated a circulating infection within the market in a short term and then leading to the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan and other areas. The EBSP results showed that the first estimated expansion date of SARS-CoV-2 began from 7 December 2019, which may indicated that the transmission could have begun from person to person in mid to late November.","Fang, Bin; Liu, Linlin; Yu, Xiao; Li, Xiang; Ye, Guojun; Xu, Juan; Zhang, Ling; Zhan, Faxian; Liu, Guiming; Pan, Tao; Shu, Yilin; Jiang, Yongzhong",bioRxiv,465,20

Here we demonstrate that USP18 expression is induced by HIV-1 in a T1 IFN dependent manner. Experimental depletion of USP18 by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing results in a significant restriction of HIV-1 replication in an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived macrophage model. In the absence of USP18, macrophages have increased responsiveness to stimulation with T1 IFNs with prolonged phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 and increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes that are key for antiviral responses. Interestingly, HIV-1 requires some signaling through the T1 IFN receptor to replicate efficiently because a neutralizing antibody that inhibits T1 IFN activity reduces HIV-1 replication rate in monocyte-derived macrophages. USP18 induction by HIV-1 tunes the IFN response to optimal levels allowing for efficient transcription from the HIV-1 LTR promoter while minimizing the T1 IFN-induced antiviral response that would otherwise restrict viral replication and spread. Finally, iPSC and CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting offer a powerful tool to study host factors that regulate innate immune responses.","Taylor, Jared P.; Cash, Melanie N.; Santostefano, Katherine E.; Nakanishi, Mahito; Terada, Naohiro; Wallet, Mark A.",Journal of Leukocyte Biology,465,16

Thus, expanding our current knowledge of reservoir hosts and pandemics represents an urgent and critical tool in ecological epidemiology. We also propose to create an integrative database that ranks animal species in terms of their likelihood as hosts for specific infectious diseases. We call for a global and cooperative effort of field and laboratory scientists to create, maintain, and update this information in order to reduce the severity of future pandemics.","Zhu, Pingfen; Garber, Paul A.; Wang, Ling; Li, Meng; Belov, Katherine; Gillespie, Thomas R.; Zhou, Xuming",Innovation (N Y),465,21

This pandemic has led to the spread of online misinformation, closure of schools, postponement of re-opening of schools, and restrictions on healthy outdoor activities. These, in turn, have caused a disruption in the daily life of middle school students. This study aimed to identify the relationships between eHealth literacy, awareness of pandemic infectious diseases, and healthy lifestyle in middle school students. For this purpose, we conducted a descriptive, correlational study in two cities in the capital of South Korea. A total of 138 middle school students completed self-reported questionnaires about eHealth literacy, awareness of pandemic infectious diseases, and healthy lifestyle. Middle school students displayed moderate levels of eHealth literacy (3.72 ± 0.97), awareness of pandemic infectious diseases (3.33 ± 0.92), and healthy lifestyle (2.98 ± 0.72). Positive correlations were found between eHealth literacy and awareness of pandemic infectious diseases (r = 0.44, p < 0.001), between eHealth literacy and healthy lifestyle (r = 0.52, p < 0.001), and between awareness of pandemic infectious diseases and healthy lifestyle (r = 0.38, p < 0.001). These findings suggest that eHealth literacy may be an important aspect of increasing the awareness about pandemic infectious diseases and forming healthy lifestyle habits in Korean middle school students during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Choi, Sinyoung; Bang, Kyung-Sook; Shin, Da-Ae",Children (Basel),465,16

However, in real-world scenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited thereby precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or remove) in order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of current COVID-19 epidemic. Here, we study a novel immunization strategy where only n nodes are observed at a time and the most central between these n nodes is immunized (or attacked). This process is continued repeatedly until 1-p fraction of nodes are immunized (or attacked). We develop an analytical framework for this approach and determine the critical percolation threshold pc and the size of the giant component P∞ for networks with arbitrary degree distributions P(k). In the limit of n→∞ we recover prior work on targeted attack, whereas for n=1 we recover the known case of random failure. Between these two extremes, we observe that as n increases, pc increases quickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization (attack) with complete information. In particular, we find a new scaling relationship between |pc(∞) -pc (n)| and n as |pc(∞) -pc (n)|~n-1exp(-α n). For Scale-free (SF) networks, where P(k)~k-γ,2<γ<3), we find that pc has a transition from zero to non-zero when n increases from n=1 to order of logN (N is the size of network). Thus, for SF networks, knowledge of order of logN nodes and immunizing them can reduce dramatically an epidemics.","Liu, Yangyang; Sanhedrai, Hillel; Dong, Gaogao; Shekhtman, Louis M.; Wang, Fan; Buldyrev, Sergey V.; Havlin, Shlomo",,465,21

Consequently, strategies to increase the throughput for clinical laboratories to conduct large-scale diagnostic testing are urgently needed. Here we support the hypothesis that standard diagnostic protocol for SARS-CoV-2 virus could be conveniently applied to pooled samples obtained from different subjects. We suggest that a two-step sequential pooling procedure could identify positive subjects, ensuring at the same time significant benefits of costs and time. Simulation data are used to assess the efficiency, in terms of number of required tests, both for random assignment of the subjects to the pools and for situations when epidemiological and clinical data are used to create an ""informed"" version of the pooling. Different scenarios are examined in the simulations to measure the effect of different pool sizes and different values for the virus frequency.

The immediate animal origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, remains unknown, a notoriously challenging task for emerging disease investigations. Coevolution with hosts leads to specific evolutionary signatures within viral genomes that can inform likely animal origins. We obtained a set of 650 spike protein and 511 whole genome nucleotide sequences from 225 and 187 viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae, respectively. We then trained random forest models independently on genome composition biases of spike protein and whole genome sequences, including dinucleotide and codon usage biases in order to predict animal host (of nine possible categories, including human). In hold-one-out cross-validation, predictive accuracy on unseen coronaviruses consistently reached ∼73%, indicating evolutionary signal in spike proteins to be just as informative as whole genome sequences. However, different composition biases were informative in each case. Applying optimised random forest models to classify human sequences of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV revealed evolutionary signatures consistent with their recognised intermediate hosts (camelids, carnivores), while human sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were predicted as having bat hosts (suborder Yinpterochiroptera), supporting bats as the suspected origins of the current pandemic. In addition to phylogeny, variation in genome composition can act as an informative approach to predict emerging virus traits as soon as sequences are available. More widely, this work demonstrates the potential in combining genetic resources with machine learning algorithms to address long-standing challenges in emerging infectious diseases.","Brierley, Liam; Fowler, Anna",bioRxiv,465,12

The disease can evolve into acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure, due to viral spread in the blood and an excessive inflammatory reaction including cytokine storm. Antiviral and anti-cytokine drugs have proven to be poorly or in-effective in stopping disease progression, and mortality or serious chronic damage is common in severely ill cases. The low efficacy of antiviral drugs is probably due to late administration, when the virus has triggered the inflammatory reaction and is no longer the main protagonist. The relatively poor efficacy of anti-cytokine drugs is explained by the fact that they act on one or a few of the dozens of cytokines involved, and because other mediators of inflammation – reactive oxygen and nitrogen species – are not targeted. When produced in excess, reactive species cause extensive cell and tissue damage. The only drug known to inhibit the excessive production of reactive species and cytokines is methylene blue, a low-cost dye with antiseptic properties used effectively to treat malaria, urinary tract infections, septic shock, and methaemoglobinaemia. We propose testing methylene blue to contrast Covid-related acute respiratory distress syndrome, but particularly suggest testing it early in Covid infections to prevent the hyper-inflammatory reaction responsible for the serious complications of the disease.","Scigliano, Giulio; Scigliano, Giuseppe Augusto",Med Hypotheses,465,13

As a result, cancer caregivers may have to shoulder triple crises: the COVID-19 pandemic, pronounced healthcare needs from the patient, and elevated need for care from within. While technology-based health interventions have the potential to address unique challenges cancer caregivers face amid COVID-19, limited insights are available. Thus, to bridge this gap, we aim to identify technology-based interventions designed for cancer caregivers and report the characteristics and effects of these interventions concerning cancer caregivers' distinctive challenges amid COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature will be conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Scopus from the database inception to the end of March 2021. Articles that center on technology-based interventions for cancer caregivers will be included in the review. The search strategy will be developed in consultation with an academic librarian who is experienced in systematic review studies. Titles, abstracts, and full-text articles will be screened against eligibility criteria developed a priori. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses procedures will be followed for the reporting process. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has upended cancer care as we know it. Findings of this study can shed light on evidence-based and practical solutions cancer caregivers can utilize to mitigate the unique challenges they face amid COVID-19.

This study sought to examine interest in clinic-based financial services to address financial stress in low-income, Medicaid-enrolled prenatal patients and its relationship with self-reported social risks. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients at a large safety-net prenatal clinic. Participants completed a written survey on interest in linkage to financial services, poverty-related financial stress, difficulty affording social needs, and interest in services to address material hardships. We compared interest in financial and social needs services by level of financial stress using multivariate regression. RESULTS: Respondents (N = 108) were entirely Medicaid-enrolled, with a majority identifying as Hispanic/Latinx (57%) or Black/African American (20%). Sixty-four percent indicated interest in connection to any of the financial services surveyed. Interest was highest in employment (52%), savings and budgeting (49%), job training/adult education (49%), and financial counseling (48%) services. Individuals with high financial stress, compared to those with low financial stress, expressed a higher level of interest in financial services (aRR = 1.61 [95% CI 1.12-2.39]). Interest in financial services was associated with difficulty affording social needs (aRR = 2.24 [95% CI 1.33-4.43]) and interest in services addressing social needs (aRR = 1.45 [95% CI 1.13-1.92]). CONCLUSION: In this study of low-income, Medicaid-insured prenatal patients, there was a high degree of interest in clinic-based financial services. Integrating financial services into prenatal health care appears to be an approach that low-income patients would be interested in to directly address poverty and financial stress.","Liu, Patrick Y.; Bell, Orly; Wu, Olivia; Holguin, Monique; Lozano, Christina; Jasper, Erika; Saleeby, Erin; Smith, Lynne; Szilagyi, Peter; Schickedanz, Adam",J Prim Care Community Health,465,16

Methods: A cross-sectional survey-based study was carried out between January and February 2021 to collect data on the side effects following the COVID-19 vaccine among healthcare workers in the Czech Republic. The study used a validated questionnaire with twenty-eight multiple-choice items covering the participants’ demographic data, medical anamneses, COVID-19-related anamneses, general, oral, and skin-related side effects. Results: Injection site pain (89.8%), fatigue (62.2%), headache (45.6%), muscle pain (37.1%), and chills (33.9%) were the most commonly reported side effects. All the general side effects were more prevalent among the ≤43-year-old group, and their duration was mainly one day (45.1%) or three days (35.8%) following the vaccine. Antihistamines were the most common drugs associated with side effects, thus requiring further investigation. The people with two doses were generally associated with a higher frequency of side effects. Conclusions: The distribution of side effects among Czech healthcare workers was highly consistent with the manufacturer’s data, especially in terms of their association with the younger age group and the second dose. The overall prevalence of some local and systemic side effects was higher than the manufacturer’s report.

In the context of an ongoing pandemic, it is essential to externally validate widely used tests to assure correct diagnostics and epidemiological estimations. We evaluated the performance of the COVID-19 ELISA IgG and IgM/A (Vircell, S.L.) against a highly specific and sensitive in-house Luminex immunoassay in a set of samples from pregnant women and cord blood. The agreement between both assays was moderate to high for IgG but low for IgM/A. Considering seropositivity by either IgG and/or IgM/A, the technical performance of the ELISA was highly imbalanced, with 96% sensitivity at the expense of 22% specificity. As for the clinical performance, the negative predictive value reached 87% while the positive predictive value was 51%. Our results stress the need for highly specific and sensitive assays and external validation of diagnostic tests with different sets of samples to avoid the clinical, epidemiological and personal disturbances derived from serological misdiagnosis.","Santano, R.; Barrios, D.; Crispi, F.; Crovetto, F.; Vidal, M.; Chi, J.; Izquierdo, L.; Gratacos, E.; Moncunill, G.; Dobano, C.",,465,17

People with disabilities were often more vulnerable to the adverse effects of the pandemic. Some areas of community participation affected for this population include employment, access to transportation, and social engagement and connection to others. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic for people with mobility disabilities across a variety of topics related to community engagement including social interactions with family and friends, and access to caregivers, groceries, transportation, and employment. METHODS: A survey was administered to participants with mobility disabilities (N = 39). Participants were asked to elaborate on topic areas that they identified as being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and a content analysis in search of themes from open-ended responses. RESULTS: Results indicate that access to family and friends was the most negatively affected topic related to participation, followed by access to food and groceries, transportation, employment, living independently, caring for others, and participating in the community in general. In response to these pandemic-related challenges, participants reported utilizing technology to connect with others and to get essential items delivered. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this rapid research emphasize the need for emergency preparedness strategies, accessible and reliable resources related to technology use (e.g., Internet), and continued access to services for people with disabilities to maintain various aspects of community participation throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and in the future.","Koon, Lyndsie M.; Greiman, Lillie; Schulz, Jonathan A.; Goddard, Kelsey S.; Nzuki, Isaac M.; Hall, Jean P.",Disabil Health J,465,10

A mixed methods study of faculty self-efficacy, job satisfaction and burnout",19.375887,3.5451856,2021-08-18,"Introduction: Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are used to reduce transmission of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of specific NPIs has been inconsistent. We assessed the effectiveness of NPIs around internal containment and closure, international travel restrictions, economic measures, and health system actions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 130 countries and territories. Methods: We used panel (longitudinal) regression to estimate the effectiveness of 13 categories of NPIs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission with data from January - June 2020. First, we examined the temporal association between NPIs using hierarchical cluster analyses. We then regressed the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 against different NPIs. We examined different model specifications to account for the temporal lag between NPIs and changes in Rt, levels of NPI intensity, time-varying changes in NPI effect and variable selection criteria. Results were interpreted taking into account both the range of model specifications and temporal clustering of NPIs. Results: There was strong evidence for an association between two NPIs (school closure, internal movement restrictions) and reduced Rt. Another three NPIs (workplace closure, income support and debt/contract relief) had strong evidence of effectiveness when ignoring their level of intensity, while two NPIs (public events cancellation, restriction on gatherings) had strong evidence of their effectiveness only when evaluating their implementation at maximum capacity (e.g., restrictions on 1000+ people gathering were not effective, restrictions on <10 people gathering was). Evidence supporting the effectiveness of the remaining NPIs (stay-at-home requirements, public information campaigns, public transport closure, international travel controls, testing, contact tracing) was inconsistent and inconclusive. We found temporal clustering between many of the NPIs. Conclusion: Understanding the impact that specific NPIs have had on SARS-CoV-2 transmission is complicated by temporal clustering, time-dependent variation in effects and differences in NPI intensity. However, the effectiveness of school closure and internal movement restrictions appears robust across different model specifications taking into account these effects, with some evidence that other NPIs may also be effective under particular conditions. This provides empirical evidence for the potential effectiveness of many although not all the actions policy-makers are taking to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liu, Y.; Morgenstern, C.; Kelly, J.; Lowe, R.; CMMID COVID-19 Working Group,; Jit, M.",,465,20

During the first wave of the COVID-19, most of the countries have register an increase in alcohol consumption. However, studies on the impact of alcohol addiction on the risk of COVID-19 infection are very scarce and inconclusive. This research offers a descriptive observational retrospective cohort study using real world data obtained from the Electronic Health Records. We found that patients with a personal history of alcohol abuse were 8% more likely to extend their hospitalization length of stay for 1 day (95% CI = 1.04–1.12) and 15% more likely to extend their Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay (95% CI = 1.01–1.30). They were also 5.47 times more at risk of needing an ICU admission (95% CI = 1.61–18.57) and 3.54 times (95% CI = 1.51–8.30) more at risk of needing a respirator. Regarding COVID-19 symptoms, patients with a personal history of alcohol abuse were 91% more likely of exhibiting dyspnea (95% CI = 1.03–3.55) and 3.15 times more at risk of showing at least one neuropsychiatric symptom (95% CI = 1.61–6.17). In addition, they showed statistically significant differences in the number of neuropsychiatric symptoms developed during the COVID-19 infection. Therefore, we strongly recommend to warn of the negative consequences of alcohol abuse over COVID-19 complications. For this purpose. Clinicians should systematically assess history of alcohol issues and drinking habits in all patients, especially for those who seek medical advice regarding COVID-19 infection, in order to predict its severity of symptoms and potential complications. Moreover, this information should be included, in a structured field, into the Electronic Health Record to facilitate the automatic extraction of data, in real time, useful to evaluate the decision-making process in a dynamic context.","Varela Rodríguez, Carolina; Arias Horcajadas, Francisco; Martín-Arriscado Arroba, Cristina; Combarro Ripoll, Carolina; Juanes Gonzalez, Alba; Esperesate Pajares, Marina; Rodrigo Holgado, Irene; Cadenas Manceñido, Álvaro; Sánchez Rodríguez, Laura; Baselga Penalva, Blanca; Marín, Marta; Rubio, Gabriel",Front Neurol,465,2
