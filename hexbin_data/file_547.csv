STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-two infants (44 preterm infants born ≤32 weeks gestation at term equivalent age and 48 full-term infants within 4 days of birth) had a standardized oral feeding assessment. RESULT: Preterm infants at term equivalent age had lower Neonatal Eating Outcome Assessment scores (67.8 ± 13.6 compared with 82.2 ± 8.1; p < 0.001) and were more likely to have poor arousal (p = 0.04), poor tongue positioning (p = 0.04), suck–swallow–breathe discoordination (p < 0.001), inadequate sucking bursts (p = 0.01), tonal abnormalities (p < 0.001), discoordination of the jaw and tongue during sucking (p < 0.001), lack of positive engagement with the feeder and/or discomfort (p < 0.001), signs of aspiration (p < 0.001), difficulty regulating breathing (p < 0.001), and have an inability to maintain an appropriate state (p < 0.001), and complete the feeding (<0.001). CONCLUSION: A broad range of feeding-related difficulties appear to remain evident in preterm infants at term equivalent age.","Pineda, Roberta; Prince, Danielle; Reynolds, Jenny; Grabill, Molly; Smith, Joan",J Perinatol,547,4

Upon recognition of protein fragments (peptides), activated T cells will contribute to the immune response and help clear infection. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, or human leukocyte antigens (HLA) in humans, bind these peptides to present them to T cells that recognise them with their surface T cell receptors (TCR). This recognition event is the first step that leads to T cell activation, and in turn can dictate disease outcomes. The visualisation of TCR interaction with pMHC using structural biology has been crucial in understanding this key event, unravelling the parameters that drive this interaction and their impact on the immune response. The last five years has been the most productive within the field, wherein half of current unique TCR–pMHC-I structures to date were determined within this time. Here, we review the new insights learned from these recent TCR–pMHC-I structures and their impact on T cell activation.","Szeto, Christopher; Lobos, Christian A.; Nguyen, Andrea T.; Gras, Stephanie",Int J Mol Sci,547,1

There is a paucity of studies which document and provide appraisal of these initiatives in Rajasthan. AIM: To document ongoing e-Health Initiatives based on technologies and approaches used, coverage by the region and population, services provided and scope. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Primary data collection in form of key-informant interviews while secondary data collection in form of internet-based search of peer and non-peer reviewed literature was conducted to achieve the study objectives. Appropriate documents, records, and reports were reviewed to ensure that all necessary information was obtained. RESULTS: A total of 13 e-Health initiatives were included in the study. The e-Health programs were classified with the use of WHO's classification of Digital Health Interventions v1.0. Most of the initiatives perceived in the study were found to be beneficial to the community, covering the entire population targeted. Supporting agencies, technologies used, and challenges faced during the implementation were identified and documented. Lack of trained manpower, technical and software glitches and deficiency of awareness activities were few obstacles that were found consistent across all user groups. CONCLUSIONS: The overview from this study augmented the knowledge about further scopes and sustainability of these initiatives. Deploying dedicated professionals may improve the functioning of these initiatives. Since e-Health interventions significantly influence healthcare systems, further scale-up of such studies with appropriate evaluation should be planned to guide policy decisions.","Joshi, Nitin Kumar; Bhardwaj, Pankaj; Suthar, Praveen; Jain, Yogesh Kumar; Joshi, Vibha; Singh, Kuldeep",J Family Med Prim Care,547,4

The pharmacokinetics of propofol are however different in children compared to adults. The value of exhaled propofol measurements in pediatric anesthesia has not yet been investigated. Breathing system filters and breathing circuits can also interfere with the measurements. In this study, we investigated correlations between exhaled propofol (exP) concentrations and the Narkotrend Index (NI) as well as calculated propofol plasma concentrations. METHODS: A multi-capillary-column (MCC) combined with ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) was used to determine exP. Optimal positioning of breathing system filters (near-patient or patient-distant) and sample line (proximal or distal to filter) were investigated. Measurements were taken during induction (I), maintenance (M) and emergence (E) of children under total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). Correlations between ExP concentrations and NI and predicted plasma propofol concentrations (using pediatric pharmacokinetic models Kataria and Paedfusor) were assessed using Pearson correlation and regression analysis. RESULTS: Near-patient positioning of breathing system filters led to continuously rising exP values when exP was measured proximal to the filters, and lower concentrations when exP was measured distal to the filters. The breathing system filters were therefore subsequently attached between the breathing system tubes and the inspiratory and expiratory limbs of the anesthetic machine. ExP concentrations significantly correlated with NI and propofol concentrations predicted by pharmacokinetic models during induction and maintenance of anesthesia. During emergence, exP significantly correlated with predicted propofol concentrations, but not with NI. CONCLUSION: In this study, we demonstrated that exP correlates with calculated propofol concentrations and NI during induction and maintenance in pediatric patients. However, the correlations are highly variable and there are substantial obstacles: Without patient proximal placement of filters, the breathing circuit tubing must be changed after each patient, and furthermore, during ventilation, a considerable additional loss of heat and moisture can occur. Adhesion of propofol to plastic parts (endotracheal tube, breathing circle) may especially be problematic during emergence.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline NG48 aims to maintain and improve the oral health of care home residents. A co-design process that worked with residents and care home staff to understand how the NG48 guideline could be best implemented in practice has been undertaken to refine a complex intervention. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of the intervention to inform a future larger scale definitive trial. METHODS: This is a protocol for a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial with a 12-month follow-up that will be undertaken in 12 care homes across two sites (six in London, six in Northern Ireland). Care homes randomised to the intervention arm (n = 6) will receive the complex intervention based on the NG48 guideline, whilst care homes randomised to the control arm (n = 6) will continue with routine practice. The intervention will include a training package for care home staff to promote knowledge and skills in oral health promotion, the use of the Oral Health Assessment Tool on residents by trained care home staff, and a ‘support worker assisted’ daily tooth-brushing regime with toothpaste containing 1500 ppm fluoride. An average of ten residents, aged 65 years or over who have at least one natural tooth, will be recruited in each care home resulting in a recruited sample of 120 participants. Assessments will be undertaken at baseline, 6 months and 12 months, and will include a dental examination and questionnaires on general health and oral health administered by a research assistant. A parallel process evaluation involving semi-structured interviews will be undertaken to explore how the intervention could be embedded in standard practice. Rates of recruitment and retention, and intervention fidelity will also be recorded. A cost-consequence model will determine the relevance of different outcome measures in the decision-making context. DISCUSSION: The study will provide valuable information for trialists, policymakers, clinicians and care home staff on the feasibility and associated costs of oral health promotion in UK care homes.

24134,24134,24134,Infectieziekten,17.01704,-1.2292076,2013-05-07,"Until today, computed tomography (CT) is the most important and valuable radiological modality to detect, analyze, and diagnose diffuse interstitial lung diseases (DILD), based on the unsurpassed morphological detail provided by high-resolution CT technique. In the past decade, there has been a shift from an isolated histopathological diagnosis to a multidisciplinary acquired diagnosis consensus that is nowadays regarded to provide the highest level of diagnostic accuracy in patients with diffuse interstitial lung diseases. The 2002 ATS/ERS statement on classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias assigned a central role to high-resolution CT (HRCT) in the diagnostic workup of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (ATS/ERS consensus classification 2002). The more recent 2013 ERS/ATS statement reinforced that combined clinical data (presentation, exposures, smoking status, associated diseases, lung function, and laboratory findings) and radiological findings are essential for a multidisciplinary diagnosis (Travis et al., Am J Respir Crit Care Med 188(6):733–748, 2013). The traditional HRCT consisted of discontinuous 1 mm high-resolution axial slices. The primary focus was on visual pattern analysis demanding for the highest possible spatial resolution. Because of the intrinsic high structural contrast of the lung, it has been possible to substantially reduce dose without losing diagnostic information. This development has been supported by new detection and reconstruction techniques. Not only detection of subtle disease and visual comparison of disease stage but also disease classification and quantification nowadays take advantage of continuous volumetric data acquisition provided by multidetector row (MD) CT technique. The following book chapter will focus on acquisition technique with special emphasis on dose and reconstruction, advantages, and new diagnostic options of volumetric MDCT technique for interstitial lung diseases. Based on evidence from the literature, certain diseases will be covered more specifically, but it has to be noted that for the pattern analysis of the various interstitial lung diseases, the plethora of other publications and books is recommended.","Hovinga, Marieke; Sprengers, Ralf; Kauczor, Hans-Ulrich; Schaefer-Prokop, Cornelia",Multidetector-Row CT of the Thorax,547,15

METHODS: Literature review (1998–2003). RESULTS: With some minor modification, risk factors and major causes of death and disability have, by and large, remained much the same since 1998. However, promoting health at the beginning of the 21st century is not the same as promoting health five years ago. A number of global events and trends have practical implications for health promotion policy and practice. CONCLUSION: This was not meant to be a comprehensive review, but rather an overview to stimulate debate and discussion. We conclude that since our earlier review of health priorities in 1998, “nothing has changed, but everything has changed”. In a changing global context, there needs to be: greater emphasis on advocacy to create supportive environments, healthy public policy and legislation; partnerships with sectors outside of health to tackle social determinants of health; and leadership development to facilitate individuals and groups to address these important issues. SO WHAT? There needs to be greater emphasis on building effective partnerships to tackkle social determinants of health, as well as leadership development to facilitate participation by disadvantage groups and advocacy for policy and legislative change. Moreover, the field needs to keep abreast with technological changes that will present challenges and opportunities for communicating with target groups.","Giles‐Corti, Billie; Wood, Lisa; Donovan, Rob; Rosenberg, Michael; Saunders, Julie; Mills, Christina",Health Promot J Austr,547,4

Memory effects in the pattern of interactions among individuals are also known to affect how diffusive and spreading phenomena take place. In this paper we analyze the combined effect of these two ingredients on epidemic dynamics on networks. We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models on the recently introduced activity-driven networks with memory. By means of an activity-based mean-field approach, we derive, in the long-time limit, analytical predictions for the epidemic threshold as a function of the parameters describing the distribution of activities and the strength of the memory effects. Our results show that memory reduces the threshold, which is the same for SIS and SIR dynamics, therefore favoring epidemic spreading. The theoretical approach perfectly agrees with numerical simulations in the long-time asymptotic regime. Strong aging effects are present in the preasymptotic regime and the epidemic threshold is deeply affected by the starting time of the epidemics. We discuss in detail the origin of the model-dependent preasymptotic corrections, whose understanding could potentially allow for epidemic control on correlated temporal networks.","Tizzani, Michele; Lenti, Simone; Ubaldi, Enrico; Vezzani, Alessandro; Castellano, Claudio; Burioni, Raffaella",,547,15
32854,32854,32854,The attributable mortality of acute respiratory distress syndrome,17.189146,12.993326,2020-05-25,"As the COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded, there has been growing recognition of risks to the anesthesia and surgical teams that require careful consideration to ensure optimal patient care. Airway management and other head and neck procedures risk exposure to mucosal surfaces, secretions, droplets, and aerosols that may harbor the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This review provides guidance on optimal practice approaches for performing patient evaluation and management of head and neck procedures with the shared goal of providing safe and effective patient care while minimizing the risk of viral transmission. METHODS: The scientific literature was evaluated, focusing on strategies to reduce risk to health care workers involved in airway management and head and neck surgery. The search strategy involved curating consensus statements and guidelines relating to COVID-19 or prior coronavirus outbreaks in relation to aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) and other high-risk procedures, with the search restricted to the scope of head and neck anesthesia. A multidisciplinary team analyzed the findings, using iterative virtual communications through video conference, telephone, email, and shared online documents until consensus was achieved, loosely adapted from the Delphi technique. Items without consensus were so indicated or removed from the manuscript. RESULTS: Health care worker infection and deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and prior outbreaks mandate robust standards for infection control. Most head and neck anesthesiology procedures generate aerosols, and algorithms may be modified to mitigate risks. Examples include preoxygenation before induction of anesthesia, rapid sequence induction, closing circuits expeditiously, and consideration of apneic technique for surgical entry of airway. Rescue measures are also modified, with supraglottic airways elevated in the difficult airway algorithm to minimize the need for bag mask ventilation. Personal protective equipment for AGPs include fit-tested N95 mask (or purified air positive respirator), gloves, goggles, and gown for patients with known or suspected COVID-19. Meticulous donning and doffing technique, minimizing personnel and room traffic, diligent hand hygiene, and social distancing all can decrease risks. Perioperative management approaches may differ from commonly employed patterns including avoidance of techniques such as jet ventilation, high-flow nasal oxygen and instead utilizing techniques with a closed ventilatory circuit and secured endotracheal tube, minimizing open suctioning, and preventing aerosolization at emergence. Recommendations are made for the following head and neck procedures and considerations: primary airway management; high-flow nasal oxygen delivery; jet ventilation for laryngotracheal surgery; awake intubation; transnasal skull base surgery; tracheostomy; and use of personal protective equipment. COVID-19 testing may facilitate decision making, but it is currently often unavailable and urgency of surgical treatment must be considered. CONCLUSIONS: During pandemics, head and neck anesthesia and surgical teams have a duty to not only provide high quality patient care but also to ensure the safety of the health care team. Several specific perioperative approaches are recommended that have some variance from commonly employed practices, focusing on the reduction of AGP to minimize the risk of infection from patients with known or suspected COVID-19 infection.","Healy, David W.; Cloyd, Benjamin H.; Brenner, Michael J.; Kupfer, Robbi A.; Anam, Karina S.; Schechtman, Samuel A.",,547,9

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical effectiveness of a brief, aging service–integrated, videoconferenced behavioral activation (tele-BA) treatment delivered by lay counselors compared with videoconferenced problem-solving therapy (tele-PST) delivered by licensed clinicians and attention control (AC; telephone support calls). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 3-group randomized clinical trial using a randomization prior to consent approach included individuals aged 50 years or older who were homebound and had 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores of 15 or greater between February 15, 2016, and April 15, 2019. Tele-BA and tele-PST participants received 5 weekly treatment sessions. Assessments were performed at baseline and 12, 24, and 36 weeks after baseline. Intention-to-treat statistical analyses were performed from January 1, 2020, to February 15, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Tele-BA participants were taught 5 steps for reinforcing healthy behaviors to improve mood, physical functioning, and social engagement. Tele-PST participants were taught a 7-step approach for problem solving coping skills. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the 24-item HAMD scores. Response (ie, ≥50% reduction in HAMD) and remission (ie, HAMD <10) rates and effect sizes for clinically meaningful differences were examined. Secondary outcomes were disability, social engagement and activity frequency, and satisfaction with participation in social roles. RESULTS: A total of 277 participants were enrolled, including 193 (69.7%) women, 83 (30.0%) who were Black, 81 (29.2%) who were Hispanic, and 255 (92.1%) with income of $35 000 or less. The mean (SD) age was 67.5 (8.9) years. Among these, 90 participants were randomized to tele-BA, 93 participants were randomized to tele-PST, and 94 participants were randomized to the AC. Compared with participants in the AC group, participants in the tele-BA and tele-PST groups had significantly higher response and remission rates and medium to large effect sizes (tele-BA: raw growth modeling analysis d = 0.62 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.89]; P < .001; tele-PST: raw growth modeling analysis d = 1.00 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.26]; P < .001) for HAMD scores. While tele-PST was significantly more effective than tele-BA for reducing HAMD scores (t(258) = −2.79; P = .006), there was no difference between tele-BA and tele-PST on secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, participants who received tele-BA by lay counselors achieved statistically and clinically meaningful changes in depressive symptoms. Given shortages of licensed mental health clinicians, tele- and lay counselor–delivered services may help improve access to evidence-based depression treatment for large numbers of underserved older adults.

Quantifying which studies have a greatest impact can help researchers and policymakers in controlling the epidemic. The aim of this study is to describe the early scientific production in response to the COVID-19 epidemic through a scientometric analysis. METHODS: The study consisted of: 1) review of the scientific literature produced in the 30 days since the first paper related to COVID-19 has been published on Pubmed; 2) Identification of papers' Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) and analysis of related metrics with the construction of a 'Computed Impact Score' (CIS) that represents a unifying score over heterogeneous bibliometric indicators. The CIS takes into account all the bibliometric indicators both traditional (i.e. counting of citations) and alternative (i.e. altmetrics). In this study we use the altmetrics provided by Plum Analytics (PlumX). All bibliometric indicators for the selected papers have been collected by using their corresponding DOIs as the key for querying Scopus API, which integrates PlumX. On top of those indicators we compute the CIS. The papers with higher CIS are discussed and presented. RESULTS: 239 papers have been included in the study. A threshold for CIS of t = 1.04 (i.e.95% quantile) allowed us to record 8 papers as potentially impactful. The 8 papers are: 6 case reports, 1 methodological study, 1 editorial. First authors come from China (n = 6), USA (n = 1) and Germany (n = 1). The main topics are: case/s description (n = 5), outbreak investigation (n = 2) and 1 genomic study. CONCLUSIONS: The early response of the scientific literature during an epidemic does not follow a pre-established pattern. Tracing the traditional and non-traditional metrics measures of papers can help to understand and evaluate the impact of literature on the scientific community and general population.

With advancement in surgical technique to address deleterious postoperative sequelae of limb removal, there is a salient need to develop and operationalize interdisciplinary care frameworks to provide more comprehensive care to an otherwise challenging patient population. Herein, we describe our interdisciplinary approach to the management of amputee patient populations at our institution, referred to as the Interdisciplinary Care for Amputees Network (ICAN). This novel framework focuses on 3 fundamental areas: combined preoperative patient evaluation, orthoplastic surgical intervention, and multi-specialty postoperative functional and psychosocial rehabilitation. Importantly, the successful implementation of a combined orthoplastic clinic requires establishing a working relationship among providers to leverage increased provider familiarity. This, coupled with sufficient clinic space, dedicated operating room time, and standardized patient workflow, serves to improve care and meet patient goals of pain minimization, return to desired functional status, and improvement in quality of life.","Sobti, Nikhil; Park, Andy; Crandell, David; Smith, Felicia A.; Valerio, Ian; Lozano-Calderon, Santiago A.; Eberlin, Kyle R.; Heng, Marilyn",Plast Reconstr Surg Glob Open,547,3

It was the primary goal of this study to investigate if those athletes suffer from a depressive mood and fear of the future. Furthermore, the question was asked whether the psychological variables of self-compassion and repetitive thinking are related to this. A total of 55 semiprofessional football players completed a demographic questionnaire with questions related to depressive mood and fear of the future, and a rumination-, worry- and self-compassion scale. The results show an association between the negative scale of self-compassion and depressive mood as well as fear of the future. Whereas depressive mood was predicted by self-compassion, fear of the future was only indirectly predicted by self-compassion by the mediating effects of repetitive thinking. Also, in semiprofessional football, self-compassion interventions might be a useful tool in difficult times.

Method: In this retrospective study, 103 of 1555 hospitalized COVID-19 patients were treated with IFN-α, and the others matched through propensity score matching. Cox regression model, logistics analysis and Kaplan–Meier statistics depicted the survival curve. Results & conclusion: Single factor analysis demonstrated that fewer deaths occurred in patients treated with IFN-α compared with patients treated without IFN-α (p = 0.000). Logistics analysis showed that patients treated with IFN-α had an all-cause mortality odds ratio = 0.01 (95% CI: 0.001–0.110; p = 0.000). The Cox regression model was utilized to determine an all-cause mortality with a hazard ratio of 0.102 (95% CI: 0.030–0.351; p = 0.000). IFN-α can alleviate disease severity and decrease all-cause mortality, especially in critical patients.

Those communities in rural areas, where health and communication infrastructure are often limited, face additional challenges in keeping individuals informed, safe, and healthy. Moreover, the amount of misleading information circulating is making it even more difficult to convey critical and rapidly evolving public health recommendations. Michigan Technological University is located in Michigan's rural Upper Peninsula which accounts for 30% of the State's land mass but only 3% of the total population. Our goal was to increase campus and community awareness about COVID‐19 and its impact on health and society. For our rural community, we offered a 1) COVID‐19 public town hall series and 2) COVID‐19 university wide academic course. The public town hall series was delivered weekly and broadcasted live through a webinar (Zoom), social media, and local radio. Each week a speaker panel consisting of public health officials, clinicians, educators, and/or other local experts discussed a COVID‐19 topic theme and answered questions from the community. The academic course was presented as a 1‐credit seminar‐based online course open to any student. Each week students explored a COVID‐19 related topic, participated in the weekly town hall, and engaged in follow‐up discussion and reflection. Primary course learning objectives were for students to locate credible COVID‐19 information sources and describe what is known about the general health impacts of the disease. Twelve public town halls, that included more than 35 different presenters, were delivered. Number of attendees on the Zoom webinars ranged between 20‐75 individuals with many others interacting with content through social media, radio, and the recorded content. Town hall themes included the role of public health to protect community health, impact of disease on physical and mental health, health disparities, mechanisms to interrupt and halt transmission, and strategies for adapting to lifestyle changes. Undergraduate and graduate students (n=37) from a variety of majors (biology, exercise science, chemistry, engineering, business, forestry) enrolled in the course. Nearly all students (96%) reported that the course increased their awareness about COVID‐19 and the majority (61%) indicated that the course was the most effective way to obtain COVID‐19 related information. All students recommended that other students take this course in the future. The public town hall series provided a robust platform to deliver critical, real‐time health information to our campus and broader community during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Additionally, students perceived that the academic course increased their awareness of COVID‐19. Increased public health messaging is a critical step to keeping Michigan's rural Upper Peninsula informed, safe, and healthy during the COVID‐19 pandemic and may serve as a model for other rural university‐community partnerships.","Elmer, Steven; Lytle, Lydia; Kamm, Kelly",FASEB J,547,26

Costs, morbidity, and mortality are higher with PPCs than with cardiac or thromboembolic complications. Preventing and treating PPCs is a major focus of respiratory therapists, using a wide variety of techniques and devices, including incentive spirometry, CPAP, positive expiratory pressure, intrapulmonary percussive ventilation, and chest physical therapy. The scientific evidence for these techniques is lacking. CPAP has some evidence of benefit in high risk patients with hypoxemia. Incentive spirometry is used frequently, but the evidence suggests that incentive spirometry alone has no impact on PPC. Chest physical therapy, which includes mechanical clapping and postural drainage, appears to worsen atelectasis secondary to pain and splinting. As with many past respiratory therapy techniques, the profession needs to take a hard look at these techniques and work to provide only practices based on good evidence. The idea of a PPC bundle has merit and should be studied in larger, multicenter trials.

However, such research has almost exclusively defined emotion in terms of valence and arousal. Discrete emotions may affect memory above and beyond such dimensions, with recent research indicating that disgusting information is better remembered than frightening information. We initially sought to determine whether participants are sensitive to the effects of discrete emotions when predicting their future memory performance. Participants in Experiment 1 were more confident in their memory for emotional (both frightening and disgusting) images relative to neutral images, but confidence did not differ between frightening and disgusting images. However, because we did not replicate the mnemonic advantage of disgust, subsequent experiments were concerned with testing the replicability of this effect. Because metamemorial judgments sometimes eliminate memory effects, participants in Experiment 2 did not make such judgments. Even so, the effect did not replicate. The disgust advantage was ultimately replicated in Experiment 3, where participants completed a secondary task at encoding. The disgust advantage is replicable but appears less robust than previously recognised. A single-paper meta-analysis indicated that the effect is more likely under divided attention, perhaps because the mechanisms which mediate disgust-memory are relatively automatic.","West, John T; Mulligan, Neil W",Cognition & emotion,547,5

MATERIALS AND METHODS Commercially available micro- and nanoparticles of fenofibrate (Lipanthyl® and Lipanthylnano®, respectively) were administered orally to five healthy volunteers in fasting and postprandial conditions. Intraluminal and systemic drug concentrations were determined as reference data for the development of a predictive in vitro setup. To capture the observed solubility/permeability interplay, in vitro dissolution testing was performed in the presence of a permeation bag with sink conditions. RESULTS In fasting conditions, intake of nanosized fenofibrate generated increased duodenal concentrations compared to microsized fenofibrate, which was reflected in an improved systemic exposure. In postprandial conditions, duodenal concentrations were greatly enhanced for both formulations, however without an accompanying increase in systemic exposure. It appeared that micellar encapsulation of the highly lipohilic fenofibrate limited its potential to permeate from fed state intestinal fluids. To capture these in vivo observations in an in vitro setup, classic dissolution testing was combined with permeation assessment into a permeation bag with sink conditions. In case of fasting conditions, the dissolution/permeation approach allowed for an improved discriminative power between micro- and nanosized fenofibrate by better simulating the dynamic interplay of dissolution and absorption. In case of postprandial conditions, the observed solubility-permeability interplay could be simulated using the dissolution/permeation approach in combination with biorelevant media (FeSSGFFortimel and FeSSIF-V2) to mimic micellar entrapment and reduced permeation potential of fenofibrate. CONCLUSION For the first time, reduced permeation of a lipophilic drug despite increased intraluminal concentrations, was demonstrated in humans. Dissolution testing using biorelevant media in combination with permeation assessment into a sink permeation bag appeared to be a simple yet pragmatic approach to capture this solubility-permeability interplay in early formulation evaluation.","Hens, Bart; Brouwers, Joachim; Corsetti, Maura; Augustijns, Patrick",European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,547,29

Main cause of death is cardiorespiratory arrest with hypoxia and hypercapnia. Respiratory depression is mediated by opioid μ receptors expressed on respiratory neurons in the CNS. Studies on the major sites in the brainstem mediating respiratory rate suppression, the pre-Bӧtzinger complex and parabrachial complex (including the Kӧlliker Fuse nucleus), have yielded conflicting findings and interpretations but recent investigations involving deletion of μ receptors from neurons have led to greater consensus. Some opioid analgesic drugs are histamine releasers. The range of clinical effects of released histamine include increased cardiac output due to an increase in heart rate, increased force of myocardial contraction, and a dilatatory effect on small blood vessels leading to flushing, decreased vascular resistance and hypotension. Resultant hemodynamic changes do not necessarily relate directly to the concentration of histamine in plasma due to a range of variables including functional differences between mast cells and histamine-induced anaphylactoid reactions may occur less often than commonly believed. Opioid-induced histamine release rarely if ever provokes bronchospasm and histamine released by opioids in normal doses does not lead to anaphylactoid reactions or result in IgE-mediated reactions in normal patients. Hypersensitivities to opioids, mainly some skin reactions and occasional type I hypersensitivities, chiefly anaphylaxis and urticaria, are uncommon. Hypersensitivities to morphine, codeine, heroin, methadone, meperidine, fentanyl, remifentanil, buprenorphine, tramadol, and dextromethorphan are summarized. In 2016, the FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication concerning the association of opioids with serotonin syndrome, a toxicity associated with raised intra-synaptic concentrations of serotonin in the CNS, inhibition of serotonin reuptake, and activation of 5-HT receptors. Opioids may provoke serotonin toxicity especially if administered in conjunction with other serotonergic medications. The increasing use of opioid analgesics and widespread prescribing of antidepressants and psychiatric medicines, indicates the likelihood of an increased incidence of serotonin toxicity in opioid-treated patients.","Baldo, Brian A",Archives of toxicology,547,1

Here we report the surprising result that visual experience is critical for the alignment of vDSGC dendrites to their preferred direction. Interestingly, vDSGCs in dark-reared mice lose their inhibition-independent dendritic contribution to direction-selective tuning while maintaining asymmetric inhibitory input.

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of TTM at 32-34 °C while considering the degree of cerebral injury and cerebral circulation, as assessed by regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2). METHODS This is a secondary analysis of prospectively collected registry data from comatose patients who were transferred to 15 hospitals in Japan after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) from 2011 to 2013. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 90 days after OHCA, and the secondary outcome was favorable neurological outcomes as evaluated according to the Cerebral Performance Category. We monitored rSO2 noninvasively with near-infrared spectroscopy, which could assess cerebral perfusion and the balance of oxygen delivery and uptake. RESULTS We stratified 431 study patients into three groups according to rSO2 on hospital arrival: rSO2 ≤40% (n = 296), rSO2 41-60% (n = 67), and rSO2 ≥61% (n = 68). Propensity score analysis revealed that TTM at 32-34 °C decreased all-cause mortality in patients with rSO2 41-60% (average treatment effect on treated [ATT] by propensity score matching [PSM] -0.51, 95%CI -0.70 to -0.33; ATT by inverse probability of treatment weighting [IPW] -0.52, 95%CI -0.71 to -0.34), and increased favorable neurological outcomes in patients with rSO2 41-60% (ATT by PSM 0.50, 95%CI 0.32-0.68; ATT by IPW 0.52, 95%CI 0.35-0.69). CONCLUSION TTM at 32-34 °C effectively decreased all-cause mortality in comatose OHCA patients with rSO2 41-60% on hospital arrival in Japan.","Nakatani, Yuka; Nakayama, Takeo; Nishiyama, Kei; Takahashi, Yoshimitsu",Resuscitation,547,12

Various studies have highlighted that patients infected with COVID-19 may develop various degrees of liver injury. Here, we discuss the impact of underlying liver disease and manifestations of hepatic injury with COVID-19. We also review mechanisms of hepatic injury. METHODS We searched the database PubMed for all studies focused on hepatic injury in COVID-19. RESULTS We identified 13 studies that assessed the impact of underlying liver disease in patients infected with COVID-19 (N=3046). Underlying liver disease was one of the most common known comorbid categories in patients infected with COVID-19. Overall, 25% of the patients identified from the 13 studies had hepatic injury. Twenty-one percent and 24% had elevated alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase values, respectively. Nine percent of the patients had elevated total bilirubin values. Ten of the 13 studies assessed COVID-19 acuity with severity of hepatic injury. In 9 of the 10 studies, clinical outcomes were worse with hepatic injury. CONCLUSIONS Liver injury is highly prevalent in patients that present with COVID-19. Since the liver is one of the most affected organs outside of the respiratory system in COVID-19, more intensive surveillance is warranted for severe cases, particularly among those with pre-existing advanced liver disease.","Kullar, Ravina; Patel, Ankur P; Saab, Sammy",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,547,22

Many researchers have reported LECS to be a feasible technique for gastric submucosal tumor resection regardless of tumor location, including the esophagogastric junction (EGJ). Recently, the Japanese National Health Insurance system approved LECS for insurance coverage, and it is now widely applied for gastric submucosal tumor resection. Initially, we applied LECS to gastric SMTs without ulcerative lesions due to concern about the possibility of tumor cells seeding into the peritoneal cavity, in a procedure termed ""classical LECS"". To expand the indication of LECS for gastric epithelial neoplasms, modified LECS procedures such as inverted LECS, non-exposed endoscopic wall-inversion surgery (NEWS), combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic approaches to neoplasia with non-exposure technique (CLEAN-NET), and closed laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (closed-LECS) have been developed and applied to patients with gastric epithelial neoplasms. As a future perspective of LECS, we plan to combine the modified LECS procedure and sentinel node (SN) navigation surgery (SNNS) for clinical (c)Stage IA gastric cancer resection. This strategy could be a minimally invasive surgical technique for cStage IA early gastric cancer.","Matsuda, Tatsuo; Nunobe, Souya; Ohashi, Manabu; Hiki, Naoki",Translational gastroenterology and hepatology,547,31

BACKGROUND Modern situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, are rapidly accelerating the need for organizations to move employee teams to virtual environments, sometimes with little to no opportunities to prepare for the transition. It is likely that organizations will continually have to adapt to evolving conditions in the future. METHOD This review synthesizes the literature from several sources on best practices, lessons learned, and strategies for virtual teams. Information from each article deemed relevant was then extracted and de-identified. Over 64 best practices were independently and blindly coded for relevancy for the swift deployment of virtual teams. RESULTS As a result of this review, tips for virtual teams undergoing rapid transition to remote work were developed. These tips are organized at the organization, team, and individual levels. They are further categorized under six overarching themes: norm setting, performance monitoring, leadership, supportive mechanisms, communication, and flexibility. CONCLUSION There is a significant deficit in the literature for best practices for virtual teams for the purposes of rapid deployment, leaving it to organizations to subjectively determine what advice to adhere to. This manuscript synthesizes relevant practices and provides insights into effective virtual team rapid deployment.","Kilcullen, Molly; Feitosa, Jennifer; Salas, Eduardo",Human factors,547,30

The available evidence supports the use of high-flow nasal cannulae for selected patients with acute hypoxaemic respiratory failure. Heliox might prevent intubation or improve gas flow in mechanically ventilated patients with severe asthma. Additionally, it might improve the delivery of aerosolised bronchodilators in obstructive lung disease in general. Inhaled nitric oxide might improve outcomes in a subset of patients with postoperative pulmonary hypertension who had cardiac surgery; however, it has not been shown to provide long-term benefit in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Inhaled prostacyclins, similar to inhaled nitric oxide, are not recommended for routine use in patients with ARDS, but can be used to improve oxygenation in patients who are not adequately stabilised with traditional therapies. Aerosolised bronchodilators are useful in mechanically ventilated patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but are not recommended for those with ARDS. Use of aerosolised antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia and ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis shows promise, but the delivered dose can be highly variable if proper attention is not paid to the delivery method.","Levy, Sean D; Alladina, Jehan W; Hibbert, Kathryn A; Harris, R Scott; Bajwa, Ednan K; Hess, Dean R",Lancet,547,1

By the end of 2020, a new bull run started, and the prices of several cryptocurrencies reached record-breaking highs. The factors affecting this rise of cryptocurrencies include the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic crisis and the global increase in the inflation rate, as well as the gradual acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrencies by people worldwide. This exploratory research is focused on this last factor, i.e., using cryptocurrency and with it, the associated support of its ecosystem (e.g., mining, staking). A survey was carried out investigating the motivational factors and barriers to investment in cryptocurrency for Czech representatives of Generations Y and Z (18–42 years;n = 468). The geographic scope was nationwide, and quota sampling was used. Notably, this survey was carried out prior to the global COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, and it is thus not affected by the pandemic and its related economic impacts. The article investigates the dependency between the individual motivational factors and barriers from the perspective of the tendency to take risks (using the risk propensity scale), according to gender and representation of Generations Y and Z. The lack of information on this form of investment is considered as the main barrier to investment in cryptocurrency, with respect to sex and generations. Compared to that, a negative experience with investment in cryptocurrency constitutes the most minor barrier. Respondents that have a tendency to take risks are mostly put off by their lack of experience with investment in general. The main motivational factor for investment in cryptocurrency, with respect to sex and generations, is considered to be the speed of increase in cryptocurrency value. On the other hand, the least encouraging factor is the opportunity to use the high volatility of cryptocurrency for speculative trading. Interestingly, this factor mostly encourages respondents that do not have a tendency to take risks. The findings are discussed, along with the presentation of their implications for practice and the directions of further explanatory research.","Smutny, Zdenek Sulc Zdenek Lansky Jan",Mathematics,547,25

According to the theoretical framework of “embodied cognition”, the semantic content of cognitive processes is represented by multimodal networks in the brain which also include body-related functions. Such multimodal representation could offer a mechanism which explains mutual influences between cognition and sleep. In the current study we tested whether sleep-related words are represented in multimodal networks by examining the effect of congruent vs. incongruent body positions on word processing during wakefulness. We experimentally manipulated the body position of 66 subjects (50 females, 16 males, 19-40 years old) between standing upright and lying down. Sleep- and activity-related words were presented around the individual speech recognition threshold to increase task difficulty. Our results show that word processing is facilitated in congruent body positions (sleep words: lying down and activity words: standing upright) compared with incongruent body positions, as indicated by a reduced N400 of the event-related potential (ERP) in the congruent condition with the lowest volume. In addition, early sensory components of the ERP (N180 and P280) were enhanced, suggesting that words were also acoustically better understood when the body position was congruent with the semantic meaning of the word. However, the difference in ERPs did not translate to differences on a behavioural level. Our results support the prediction of embodied processing of sleep- and activity-related words. Body position potentially induces a pre-activation of multimodal networks, thereby enhancing the access to the semantic concepts of words related to current the body position. The mutual link between semantic meaning and body-related function could be a key element in explaining influences of cognitive processing on sleep.","Hülsemann, Mareike J.; Rasch, Björn",bioRxiv,547,20

We formulate and test a technique that uses the trained parameters of the reservoir system output layer to deduce an estimate of the unknown network structure. Our technique, by its nature, is non-invasive, but is motivated by the widely-used invasive network inference method whereby the responses to active perturbations applied to the network are observed and employed to infer network links (e.g., knocking down genes to infer gene regulatory networks). We test this technique on experimental and simulated data from delay-coupled opto-electronic oscillator networks.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), one of the binding sites for SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, can bind to viral spike proteins, allowing transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) to activate S-protein to trigger infection and induce the production of various inflammatory factors such as interleukin-1, interferon-l, and tumor necrosis factor. Compared with adults, children tend to have lower expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which are presumed to be associated with milder symptoms and fewer cases in children. The article summarizes the research advances in the role of ACE2 during SARS-CoV-2 infection, in order to help understand the pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and provide a reference for better development of drugs and vaccines to prevent and treat coronavirus disease 2019 in children.","Liu, Jing Chen Guo Qian Wei Li Jiao Fu Yong",Chinese Journal of Contemporary Pediatrics,547,12

Given its overexpression at sites of inflammation in a wide range of diseases marked by increasingly oxidative cellular environment, a comprehensive structural understanding of how cellular redox conditions may impact the structure and function of MIF is necessary. We used solution NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry to investigate structural and dynamic signatures of MIF under varied solution redox conditions. Our results indicate that the MIF structure is modified and becomes increasingly dynamic in an oxidative environment, which may be a means to alter the MIF functional response in a redox-dependent manner. We identified latent allosteric sites within MIF that are redox-sensitive and mutational analysis reveals that loss of redox-responsive residues attenuates activation of the coreceptor CD74. Leveraging sites of redox-sensitivity therefore reveals an avenue to modulate MIF function in its “disease state” via structure-based drug design.","Skeens, Erin; Gadzuk-Shea, Meagan; Shah, Dilip; Bhandari, Vineet; Schweppe, Devin K.; Berlow, Rebecca B.; Lisi, George P.",bioRxiv,547,16

Acute shortages of respiratory protective devices such as N95 respirators led to highly innovative period in which new filter materials, chemical treatment, or new concepts for respirator protective equipment were proposed, which were purported as replacements for inconsistent supply of N95-type respirators. Evidence of this innovation is the vast number of new patents that were filed in the domain of filtering facepiece respirators during the first half of 2020 across North America, Europe and East Asia. Much of this product innovation focussed more on the technical mask performance, and less on user comfort of these new items of respiratory protective equipment. When designing respirator masks, technical performance is commonly used as a “decision gate” between iterative development cycles. From a product design perspective, user comfort is strongly linked to long-term market adoption, so user comfort has been an overlooked factor in the SARS-CoV-2 context. Three prototype folding-style filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and one commercially-available medical face mask was posted to 30 participants, who wore the masks, completed the modified R-COMFI survey for each mask. The medical face mask was included as a “control” mask which formed the baseline against which the prototype respirators were compared. The three prototype mask designs (Model A1, A2, B) were fabricated by our research group. Their R-COMFI scores were calculated from the survey data and revealed that Model A1 was the least comfortable, then the Model A2, next the Model B, and finally the medical face mask (control) was rated the most comfortable. Based on the feedback of the evaluation, a heuristic development iteration was performed on the least-comfortable respirator, Model A1, based redesigning the elastic head harness taking into the head anthropometric measurement of the users into account. A re-testing of the Model A1 respirator with a group of 12 participants showed a marked improvement in wearing comfort upon redesign of the head harness. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Warndorff, V.; Huysmans, S.; Dirx, W.; Geerardyn, F.; Uyttenbroeck, L.; Smets, S.; Vleugels, J.; Verwulgen, S.; Verlinden, J.; Watts, R.","AHFE International Conference on Ergonomics in Design, 2021",547,16

We experimentally infected domestic cats with B. koehlerae to establish the microbiological and immunological characteristics of this infection in cats and to compare it to infections with those caused by B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae. Four cats were inoculated intradermally with B. koehlerae (8.6 x 10(7) to 3.84 x 10(8) CFU/ml). None of the cats presented any obvious clinical signs, but all cats developed bacteremia, which peaked at 3.36 x 10(4) to 1.44 x 10(6) CFU/ml of blood between day 14 and day 36 postinoculation. B. koehlerae-inoculated cats had a bacteremia duration (mean, 74 days) shorter than did cats inoculated with B. clarridgeiae (mean, 324 days) (P = 0.03). None of the four cats inoculated with B. koehlerae had bacteremia relapse. As shown by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using B. koehlerae outer membrane protein (OMP) antigens, the four cats developed a species-specific antibody response, and ELISA testing using other feline Bartonella OMP antigens showed statistically lower optical density values. All four cats developed similar antibody reactivity patterns to B. koehlerae OMP antigens as seen by Western blotting, each with at least 20 seroreactive protein bands. Using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, protein profile differences were observed for both whole-cell lysate and OMPs from B. koehlerae, compared with B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae. B. koehlerae was more closely related to B. henselae than to B. clarridgeiae by protein profile, and this relatedness was also confirmed by analysis of the genomic DNA profiles by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.","Yamamoto, Kazuhiro; Chomel, Bruno B; Kasten, Rickie W; Hew, Carrie M; Weber, David K; Lee, Wilson I; Droz, Sara; Koehler, Jane E",Journal of clinical microbiology,547,28

We present and discuss the adverse effects observed in an acute psychiatric clinic that has admitted COVID-19 patients during the first three months of the pandemic in Turkey. METHODS: The COVID-19 treatment schemes were formed in accordance with the national and regional guidelines at the time of admittance, which were mainly based on the use of hydroxychloroquine and other drugs. The sample consisted exclusively of inpatients, and all patients were enrolled in the study regardless of their specific diagnosis or treatment schemes. RESULTS: 4 out of 23 patients (17.4%) had experienced adverse effects, two of which had mild hepatic enzyme elevation and one had mild sinus bradycardia. Of note is that we haven't encountered any serious complications or life-threatening events during inpatient treatment. The most emphasised adverse effect in the literature, namely QTc prolongation and ECG changes, were not observed in our sample. The adverse effects were not found to be significantly associated with patient-related factors nor dose of antipsychotic medication. CONCLUSIONS: From our point of view, non-cardiac adverse effects should not be overlooked while treating comorbid psychiatric and COVID-19 patients. KEY POINTS Acute inpatient psychiatric treatment of patients who have comorbid COVID-19 is a complex situation requiring multidisciplinary action. Adverse drug reactions, which may or not result from the interaction of psychiatric and COVID-19 treatment, should be of concern for this patient group. While there is controversy over the benefits of some of the off-label COVID-19 medications, there should also be discussion over safety and concomitant medication use.

Larger studies have been limited by both geography and specialty. Comprehensive characterisation of clinical syndromes is crucial to allow rational selection and evaluation of potential therapies. The aim of this study was to investigate the breadth of complications of COVID-19 across the UK that affected the brain. METHODS: During the exponential phase of the pandemic, we developed an online network of secure rapid-response case report notification portals across the spectrum of major UK neuroscience bodies, comprising the Association of British Neurologists (ABN), the British Association of Stroke Physicians (BASP), and the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCPsych), and representing neurology, stroke, psychiatry, and intensive care. Broad clinical syndromes associated with COVID-19 were classified as a cerebrovascular event (defined as an acute ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or thrombotic vascular event involving the brain parenchyma or subarachnoid space), altered mental status (defined as an acute alteration in personality, behaviour, cognition, or consciousness), peripheral neurology (defined as involving nerve roots, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction, or muscle), or other (with free text boxes for those not meeting these syndromic presentations). Physicians were encouraged to report cases prospectively and we permitted recent cases to be notified retrospectively when assigned a confirmed date of admission or initial clinical assessment, allowing identification of cases that occurred before notification portals were available. Data collected were compared with the geographical, demographic, and temporal presentation of overall cases of COVID-19 as reported by UK Government public health bodies. FINDINGS: The ABN portal was launched on April 2, 2020, the BASP portal on April 3, 2020, and the RCPsych portal on April 21, 2020. Data lock for this report was on April 26, 2020. During this period, the platforms received notification of 153 unique cases that met the clinical case definitions by clinicians in the UK, with an exponential growth in reported cases that was similar to overall COVID-19 data from UK Government public health bodies. Median patient age was 71 years (range 23-94; IQR 58-79). Complete clinical datasets were available for 125 (82%) of 153 patients. 77 (62%) of 125 patients presented with a cerebrovascular event, of whom 57 (74%) had an ischaemic stroke, nine (12%) an intracerebral haemorrhage, and one (1%) CNS vasculitis. 39 (31%) of 125 patients presented with altered mental status, comprising nine (23%) patients with unspecified encephalopathy and seven (18%) patients with encephalitis. The remaining 23 (59%) patients with altered mental status fulfilled the clinical case definitions for psychiatric diagnoses as classified by the notifying psychiatrist or neuropsychiatrist, and 21 (92%) of these were new diagnoses. Ten (43%) of 23 patients with neuropsychiatric disorders had new-onset psychosis, six (26%) had a neurocognitive (dementia-like) syndrome, and four (17%) had an affective disorder. 18 (49%) of 37 patients with altered mental status were younger than 60 years and 19 (51%) were older than 60 years, whereas 13 (18%) of 74 patients with cerebrovascular events were younger than 60 years versus 61 (82%) patients older than 60 years. INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first nationwide, cross-specialty surveillance study of acute neurological and psychiatric complications of COVID-19. Altered mental status was the second most common presentation, comprising encephalopathy or encephalitis and primary psychiatric diagnoses, often occurring in younger patients. This study provides valuable and timely data that are urgently needed by clinicians, researchers, and funders to inform immediate steps in COVID-19 neuroscience research and health policy.

It has become the go-to methodology for tackling image restoration and has outperformed the traditional non-local class of methods. However, the top-performing networks are generally composed of many convolutional layers and hundreds of neurons, with trainable parameters in excess of several million. We claim that this is due to the inherently linear nature of convolution-based transformation, which is inadequate for handling severe restoration problems. Recently, a non-linear generalization of CNNs, called the operational neural networks (ONN), has been shown to outperform CNN on AWGN denoising. However, its formulation is burdened by a fixed collection of well-known non-linear operators and an exhaustive search to find the best possible configuration for a given architecture, whose efficacy is further limited by a fixed output layer operator assignment. In this study, we leverage the Taylor series-based function approximation to propose a self-organizing variant of ONNs, Self-ONNs, for image restoration, which synthesizes novel nodal transformations on-the-fly as part of the learning process, thus eliminating the need for redundant training runs for operator search. In addition, it enables a finer level of operator heterogeneity by diversifying individual connections of the receptive fields and weights. We perform a series of extensive ablation experiments across three severe image restoration tasks. Even when a strict equivalence of learnable parameters is imposed, Self-ONNs surpass CNNs by a considerable margin across all problems, improving the generalization performance by up to 3 dB in terms of PSNR.","Malik, Junaid; Kiranyaz, Serkan; Gabbouj, Moncef",Neural Netw,547,16

However, the effectiveness of these test-and-travel strategies to reduce passenger risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and population-level transmission remains unknown. METHODS: In this simulation study, we developed a microsimulation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a cohort of 100 000 US domestic airline travellers using publicly available data on COVID-19 clinical cases and published natural history parameters to assign individuals one of five health states of susceptible to infection, latent period, early infection, late infection, or recovered. We estimated a per-day risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 corresponding to a daily incidence of 150 infections per 100 000 people. We assessed five testing strategies: (1) anterior nasal PCR test within 3 days of departure, (2) PCR within 3 days of departure and 5 days after arrival, (3) rapid antigen test on the day of travel (assuming 90% of the sensitivity of PCR during active infection), (4) rapid antigen test on the day of travel and PCR test 5 days after arrival, and (5) PCR test 5 days after arrival. Strategies 2 and 4 included a 5-day quarantine after arrival. The travel period was defined as 3 days before travel to 2 weeks after travel. Under each scenario, individuals who tested positive before travel were not permitted to travel. The primary study outcome was cumulative number of infectious days in the cohort over the travel period without isolation or quarantine (population-level transmission risk), and the key secondary outcome was the number of infectious people detected on the day of travel (passenger risk of infection). FINDINGS: We estimated that in a cohort of 100 000 airline travellers, in a scenario with no testing or screening, there would be 8357 (95% uncertainty interval 6144-12831) infectious days with 649 (505-950) actively infectious passengers on the day of travel. The pre-travel PCR test reduced the number of infectious days from 8357 to 5401 (3917-8677), a reduction of 36% (29-41) compared with the base case, and identified 569 (88% [76-92]) of 649 actively infectious travellers on the day of flight; the addition of post-travel quarantine and PCR reduced the number of infectious days to 2520 days (1849-4158), a reduction of 70% (64-75) compared with the base case. The rapid antigen test on the day of travel reduced the number of infectious days to 5674 (4126-9081), a reduction of 32% (26-38) compared with the base case, and identified 560 (86% [83-89]) actively infectious travellers; the addition of post-travel quarantine and PCR reduced the number of infectious days to 3124 (2356-495), a reduction of 63% (58-66) compared with the base case. The post-travel PCR alone reduced the number of infectious days to 4851 (3714-7679), a reduction of 42% (35-49) compared with the base case. INTERPRETATION: Routine asymptomatic testing for SARS-CoV-2 before travel can be an effective strategy to reduce passenger risk of infection during travel, although abbreviated quarantine with post-travel testing is probably needed to reduce population-level transmission due to importation of infection when travelling from a high to low incidence setting.

Evolving network generation models are important as they offer an explanation of both how and why complex networks (and scale-free networks, in particular) are ubiquitous. We adopt the evolution principle and then propose a very simple and intuitive new model for network growth, which naturally evolves modular networks with multiple communities. The number and size of the communities evolve over time and are primarily subjected to a single free parameter. Surprisingly, under some circumstances, our framework can construct a tree-like network with clear community structures-branches and leaves of a tree. Results also show that new communities will absorb a link resource to weaken the degree growth of hub nodes. Our models have a common explanation for the community of regular and tree-like networks and also breaks the tyranny of the early adopter; unlike the standard popularity principle, newer nodes and communities will come to dominance over time. Importantly, our model can fit well with the construction of the SARS-Cov-2 haplotype evolutionary network.","Shang, Ke-Ke; Yang, Bin; Moore, Jack Murdoch; Ji, Qian; Small, Michael",Chaos,547,15

This cell line was tested for growth in different temperatures and serum concentrations, and the best growing condition was at 20% serum at 28 °C. In cultured RFF cells, amplification of 18S rRNA from genomic DNA and immunostaining of cellular cytokeratin confirmed the proper identity of S. fuscescens fish. After 30th passage of cultures, the cells were exposed to challenge of inflammation, triggered by LPS, and hypoxia, mimicked by CoCl2. Cultured RFF cells showed robust sensitive responses to inflammation and hypoxia in directing the expressions of cytokines and hypoxia inducible factor-1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;). The water extract of aerial part of Scutellaria baicalensis (SBA) has been shown in rabbit fish to prevent inflammation. Here, we extended this notion of testing the efficacy of SBA extract in the developed cultured RFF cells. Application of SBA extract inhibited the expression of LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines, i.e. IL-1ß, IL-6, as well as the signaling of NF-&#954;B. The application of CoCl2 in cultured RFF cells triggered the hypoxia-induced cell death and up regulation of HIF-1&#945;.

Our results show the established RFF cell line may be served as an ideal in vitro model in drug screening relating to inflammation and hypoxia.

We, therefore, assessed genomic methylation at over 39 million sites in the prenatal cortex using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and found loci and regions in which methylation levels are dynamic across development. We saw that DNAm at these loci was associated with nearby gene expression and enriched for enhancer chromatin states in prenatal brain tissue. Additionally, these loci were enriched for genes associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and genes involved with neurogenesis. We also found autosomal differences in DNAm between the sexes during prenatal development, though these have less clear functional consequences. We lastly confirmed that the dynamic methylation at this critical period is specifically CpG methylation, with generally low levels of CpH methylation.

We study epidemic scenarios ranging from sustained spread to flare-up of cases, and we consider reactive vaccination alone and in combination with mass vaccination. With the same number of doses, reactive vaccination reduces cases more than non-reactive approaches, but may require concentrating a high number of doses over a short time in case of sustained spread.

METHODS: Using the HF clinic database, we compared data of patients with HF before, during, and after the peak of the pandemic (January 1 to March 17 [pre-COVID], March 17 to May 31 [peak-COVID], and June 1 to October 1 [post-COVID]). During peak-COVID, all patients were managed by Tele-HFC or hospitalization. After June 1, patients chose either a face-to-face clinic visit or a continuous tele-clinic visit. RESULTS: Cardiovascular death and medical titration rates were similar in peak-COVID compared with all other periods. HF readmission rates were significantly lower in peak-COVID (8.7% vs. 2.5%, p<0.001) and slightly increased (3.5%) post-COVID. Heart transplant rates were substantially increased in post-COVID (4.5% vs. peak-COVID [0%], p = 0.002). After June 1, 38% of patients continued with the Tele-HFC program. Patients managed by the Tele-HFC program for <6 months were less likely to have HF with reduced ejection fraction (73% vs. 54%, p = 0.005) and stage-D HF (33% vs. 14%, p = 0.001), and more likely to achieve the target neurohormonal blockade dose (p<0.01), compared with the &#8805;6-month Tele-HFC group. CONCLUSIONS: HF rehospitalization and transplant rates significantly declined during the pandemic in ambulatory care of HF. However, reduction in these rates did not affect subsequent 5-month hospitalization and cardiovascular mortality in the setting of Tele-HFC program and continuum of advanced HF therapies.","Puwanant, Sarinya; Sinphurmsukskul, Supanee; Krailak, Laddawan; Nakaviroj, Pavinee; Boonbumrong, Noppawan; Siwamogsatham, Sarawut; Chettakulanurak, Krailerk; Ariyachaipanich, Aekarach; Boonyaratavej, Smonporn",PLoS One,547,1

Information about the efficacy of its disease management is bounded to either inoculum reduction or vector control. This study aimed to assess the role of different frequencies of roguing of symptomatic trees combined with different chemical control programs of the sharpshooters' on CVC temporal progress. The experimental area was set up in October 2005 and had a 3 X 3 factorial design. Symptomatic tree removal intervals were every 28, 56, and 112 days until May 2012. Vector control treatments were no control, programs A (PA), and B (PB). Contact insecticides were sprayed every 28 (PA) or 14 (PB) days. Trees within both treatment programs were treated with systemic and foliar insecticides until October 2008. After this, the systemic insecticides were discontinued and only foliar treatments were applied. The number of diseased trees and sharpshooter population were assessed until April 2015. RESULTS: The detection of the first symptomatic trees was similar for all treatments and occurred, on average, at the 50th month after planting. Sharpshooter population and cumulative disease incidence were similar for all roguing intervals and between vector control programs, differing in plots with no control. We observed a reduction over 85% of disease incidence for both PA and PB, compared to no control. CONCLUSION: These results reinforce the systematic control of the sharpshooters as an efficient strategy for reducing CVC progress. This article is protected by copyright.

For the asymptomatic phase, the infection mostly resides in the nose, where it elicits a minimal innate immune response. For the mildly symptomatic phase, the infection is mostly in the pseudostratified epithelium of the larger airways and is accompanied by a more vigorous innate immune response. In the conducting airways, the epithelium can recover from the infection, because the keratin 5 basal cells are spared and they are the progenitor cells for the bronchial epithelium. There may be more severe disease in the bronchioles, where the club cells are likely infected. The devastating third phase is in the gas exchange units of the lung, where ACE2-expressing alveolar type II cells and perhaps type I cells are infected. The loss of type II cells results in respiratory insufficiency due to the loss of pulmonary surfactant, alveolar flooding, and possible loss of normal repair, since type II cells are the progenitors of type I cells. The loss of type I and type II cells will also block normal active resorption of alveolar fluid. Subsequent endothelial damage leads to transudation of plasma proteins, formation of hyaline membranes, and an inflammatory exudate, characteristic of ARDS. Repair might be normal, but if the type II cells are severely damaged alternative pathways for epithelial repair may be activated, which would result in some residual lung disease.","Mason, Robert J",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,547,18

As in other drugs, low solubility of these compounds has led to low bioavailability in target tissues. Enhanced drug dosages have effects such as toxicity, drug-drug interactions, and increased drug resistance by fungi. This article reviews the current state-of-the-art of antifungals, structure, mechanism of action, other usages, and toxic side effects. The emergence of nanoformulations to transport and uniformly release cargo at the target site is a boon in antifungal treatment. The article details research that lead to the development of nanoformulations of antifungals and potential advantages and avoidance of the lacunae characterizing conventional drugs. A range of nanoformulations based on liposomes, polymers are in various stages of research and their potential advantages have been brought out. It could be observed that under similar dosages, test models, and duration, nanoformulations provided enhanced activity, reduced toxicity, higher uptake and higher immunostimulatory effects. In most instances, the mechanism of antifungal activity of nanoformulations was similar to that of regular antifungal. There are possibilities of coupling multiple antifungals on the same nano-platform. Increased activity coupled with multiple mechanisms of action presents for nanoformulations a tremendous opportunity to overcome antifungal resistance. In the years to come, robust methods for the preparation of nanoformulations taking into account the repeatability and reproducibility in action, furthering the studies on nanoformulation toxicity and studies of human models are required before extensive use of nanoformulations as a prescribed drug.","Nagaraj, Saraswathi; Manivannan, Sivakami; Narayan, Shoba",J. basic microbiol,547,32

Declines in ridership caused by COVID-19 leads uncertainty about the emission reduction capacity of buses. This paper provides a method framework for analyzing spatio-temporal emission patterns of buses in combination with real-time ridership and potential emission changes in the post-COVID-19 future. Based on GPS trajectory and Smart Card data of 2056 buses from 278 routes covering 1.5 million ridership in Qingdao, China, spatio-temporal emissions characteristics of buses are studied. 7589 taxis with 0.2 million passengers' trips are used for acquiring private cars' emissions to evaluate the emissions difference between buses and cars. Empirical results show that the average difference between buses and cars with 2 persons can reach up to 117 g/km-person during 7:00-8:59 and 115 g/km-person during 17:00-18:59. However, buses have various emission benefits around the city at different periods. A double increase in emissions during non-rush hours can be observed compared with rush hours. 224 online survey data are used to study the potential ridership reduction trend in post-COVID-19. Results show that 56.3% of respondents would decrease the usage of buses in the post-COVID-19 future. Based on this figure, our analysis shows that per kilometer-person emissions of buses are higher than cars during non-rush hours, however, still lower than cars during rush hours. We conclude that when ridership reduces by more than 40%, buses cannot be ""greener"" travel modal than cars as before. Finally, several feasible policies are suggested for this potential challenge. Our study provides convincing evidence for understanding the emission patterns of buses, to support better buses investment decisions and promotion on eco-friendly public transport service in the post-COVID-19 future.","Sui, Yi; Zhang, Haoran; Shang, Wenlong; Sun, Rencheng; Wang, Changying; Ji, Jun; Song, Xuan; Shao, Fengjing",Appl Energy,547,16

A cross-sectional survey was conducted on all students studying at Phenikaa University, Hanoi, using a self-developed questionnaire consisted of 42 questions regarding KAP towards face mask use as well as reuse of cloth mask, and COVID-19 knowledge. Among 728 participants, 40.9% (298/728) were male, 63.2% (460/728) were from health-related faculties, 46% (335/728) lived in urban areas, and 51.9% (378) had good levels of COVID-19 knowledge. Regarding face mask, most (89.7%, 653/728) participants had good knowledge scores, 72.8% (530/728) had positive attitudes, and 76.5% (557/728) had good practice scores. The most common types of masks used were surgical mask (57.6%, 419/728), followed by non-antibacterial cloth mask (23.1%, 168/728). Among 168 participants using non-antibacterial cloth mask, 43.5% reused masks (73/168), of whom 6.8% (5/73) did not wash their masks at least daily. Face mask use knowledge was statistically associated with COVID-19 knowledge (P < 0.001).

Technological categories that incur high levels of population exposure are explored, and categories are described. A theoretical basis for reducing population exposure is developed from the basic concepts of technological exposure. Technological developments that potentially enable less centralised societies having lower levels of population exposure, are considered for practicality and effectiveness as are the factors that could allow and cause transition to a less technologically centralised model. Some conclusions regarding practicality, triggers, and issues arising from a decentralised society are considered and include the key conclusion that a higher level of decentralisation and exposure reduction is both desirable and possible.","Robertson, Lindsay J.",Futures,547,7

METHODS: we evaluated the metabolic profile of 304 individuals with T2DM (65% males; age 69 ± 9 years; diabetes duration 16 ± 10 years) attending our Diabetes Unit early at the end of lockdown period (June 8 to July 7, 2020) and compared it with the latest one recorded before lockdown. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in fasting plasma glucose (8.6 ± 2.1 vs 8.8 ± 2.5 mmol/L; P = 0.353) and HbA1c (7.1 ± 0.9 vs 7.1 ± 0.9%; P = 0.600) before and after lockdown.

The bottom-line of this column is that, while COVID-19 can infect virtually everyone in the human population, only about 5% are susceptible to severe infection requiring admission to an intensive care unit and/or causing a fatal outcome and this population can be identified on the basis of comorbid medical illness and/or age. These numbers are based on experience in China, the United States, and Europe. Table 1 presents an analysis conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is further supported by several other sources reviewed in the article. The population at risk for severe infection are individuals with comorbid medical illness and those 85 years of age and older. The comorbid medical illnesses identified as risk factors are preexisting respiratory and cardiovascular disease, immunocompromised status, morbid obesity (ie, body mass index &#8805;40), diabetes mellitus, and possibly significant kidney or liver impairment. Parenthetically, news reports and the literature sometimes cite age 60 years and older as a risk factor but age between 60 and 85 years is likely a surrogate for having 1 or more of these comorbid medical conditions. While 5% may initially seem like a small number, it nevertheless potentially represents 16.5 million people, given the United States population of 330 million. That is a tremendous number of people requiring intensive care unit admission and/or potentially dying, and individuals in this population have overwhelmed the US health care system in some hotspots. For this reason, this column suggests taking this at-risk population into account in mitigation strategies when attempting to open the US economy. The column addresses the following questions: (1) What are the 3 aspects of the race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19? (2) What data are currently available to help guide decisions to be made? (3) What strategies have been employed to date and how successful have they been? and (4) Might risk stratification of exposure be a viable strategy to minimize the damage caused by the virus? The race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19 requires that we obtain knowledge about the disease and its treatment or prevention, how to best safeguard public health and avoid overwhelming the health care system, and how to minimize the societal damage caused by substantial disruption of the economy. Data gathered over the past 4 months since the COVID-19 virus emerged as a human pathogen have provided guidance for our decisions going forward. The most widely adopted strategies for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic to date have involved the epidemiological approach of encouraging good hygiene practices and social distancing, including orders to ""shelter in place,"" quarantine of high-risk individuals, and isolation of infected individuals. The goal of this epidemiological approach has been to ""flatten the curve"" by reducing the height of the peak of the infection to avoid overwhelming the health care system and society in general, while buying time to learn more about the disease and find more effective ways to deal with it. However, now that more is known about COVID-19 and the portion of the population that is most at risk for serious adverse outcomes including death, it may be possible to move from a shelter-in-place approach for the entire population to focus on those at most risk and thus facilitate a gradual and rational phased reduction of social restrictions to reopen the economy. Such a graduated opening would be based on regions of countries meeting specific criteria in terms of being able to contain the virus, coupled with vigorous monitoring to look for outbreaks, followed by case monitoring, isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of exposed individuals, and increased use of testing for active disease as well as for immunity. Taking the data on high-risk individuals into account would allow for a gradual lifting of restrictions on the majority of the population while maintaining more stringent safeguards to protect the vulnerable portion of the population. Nevertheless, the entire population would need to continue to practice good hygiene and social distancing while simultaneously-and perhaps even more vigorously-focusing on sheltering the vulnerable population until adequate community immunity has been achieved to prevent the spread of the virus, whether that is accomplished through natural exposure alone or with the addition of safe and effective vaccine(s) which may not be available for a year. Continued widespread testing for antibodies will help determine how far or close this country is-and other countries are-from developing effective community immunity.","Preskorn, Sheldon H",J Psychiatr Pract,547,4

Investing in characterising the SARS-CoV2 will help plan and improve the response to the pandemic. Furthermore, it will help identify the most efficient ways of managing the pandemic, avoiding public health policies and interventions that may be unduly restrictive of normal activity or unnecessarily costly. This paper describes the design and reports findings of a population based epidemiological study undertaken to characterise SARS-CoV2 in Qatar using limited resources in a timely manner. METHODS: Asymptomatic individuals &#8805;10 years registered with Qatar's publicly funded primary health provider were eligible. A stratified random sampling technique was utilized to identify the study sample. Participants were invited to an appointment where they completed a questionnaire and provided samples for polymerase chain reaction and Immunoglobulin M and G immunoassay tests. Data collected were analyzed to calculate point and period prevalence by sociodemographic, lifestyle and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Of 18,918 individuals invited for the study, 2084 participated (response rate 10.8%). The overall point prevalence and period prevalence were estimated to be 1.6% (95% CI 1.1-2.2) and 14.6% (95% CI 13.1-16.2) respectively. Period prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection was not considerably different across age groups (9.7-19.8%). It was higher in males compared to females (16.2 and 12.7% respectively). A significant variation was observed by nationality (7.1 to 22.2%) and municipalities (6.9-35.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The study provides an example of a methodologically robust approach that can be undertaken in a timely manner with limited resources. It reports much-needed epidemiological data about the spread of SARS-CoV2. Given the low prevalence rates, majority of the population in Qatar remains susceptible. Enhanced surveillance must continue to be in place, particularly due to the large number of asymptomatic cases observed. Robust contact tracing and social distancing measures are key to prevent future outbreaks.","Syed, Mohamed Ahmed; Al Nuaimi, Ahmed Sameer; AQotba, Hamda Abdulla; Nasrallah, Gheyath K; Althani, Asmaa A; Yassine, Hadi M; Zainel, Abduljaleel Abdullatif; Khudadad, Hanan; Marji, Tamara; Veettil, Shajitha Thekke; Al-Jighefee, Hadeel T; Younes, Salma; Shurrab, Farah; Al-Sadeq, Duaa W; AlFehaidi, Al Anoud Saleh; Yfakhroo, Ameena Ibrahim; AlMesaifri, Meshal Abdulla; Al Mujalli, Hanan; Al Abdulla, Samya Ahmad; Al Kuwari, Mohamed Ghaith; Azad, Faruk Mohammed; Al Malki, Badria Ali Mohamed; Abdulmalik, Mariam Ali",BMC Infect Dis,547,16

Son impact économique est majeur, notamment sur le tourisme mondial : les voyages internationaux ont chuté de 87 % en janvier 2021 par rapport à 2020 selon l’organisation mondiale du tourisme. Nous étudions ici l’impact de la pandémie sur les voyages dans un centre de vaccinations internationales parisien. Matériels et méthodes À partir des données du dossier médical informatisé du Centre de vaccinations internationales (CVI), nous avons analysé les dossiers des voyageurs internationaux venus pour une vaccination et/ou une consultation durant deux périodes : du 1er mars 2019 au 29 février 2020 versus 1er mars 2020 au 28 février 2021. Résultats Le nombre total de voyageurs a baissé de 81 % entre les 2 périodes : de 42 978 à 8242. La diminution concerne tous les voyages quelle qu’en soit la durée. La baisse la moins forte a concerné les voyages de plus de 90 jours avec – 65 % entre les 2 périodes vs – 83 % pour les séjours de durée inférieure. On observe une diminution drastique des voyages vers l’Asie (−94 %), et une baisse moindre vers l’Afrique (−75 %). Ainsi, les séjours en Asie ne représentent plus que 3 % des voyages contre 22 % avant la COVID-19, les séjours vers l’Afrique passant eux de 57 à 74 % de la totalité des séjours. Quatre des cinq pays les plus visités restent inchangés : Côte d’Ivoire, Sénégal, Tanzanie, République Démocratique du Congo. L’âge médian des voyageurs suit une pente descendante progressive passant de 38,8 ans en mars 2019 à 25,1 ans en février 2021. Si l’on se focalise sur les consultations de médecine des voyages, on observe une baisse de 2429 à 706. Avant l’épidémie, ces consultations concernaient des séjours courts (&lt;90 jours) dans 84 % des cas et des expatriations (9,5 %), contre 60,6 % et 34,1 % respectivement après mars 2020. Pour les séjours courts, on note une baisse de 89,5 % des séjours de tourisme, de 73 % des séjours professionnels et de 47 % des visites aux apparentés (VFR). En proportion, 62 % des voyageurs étaient des touristes, 21 % des professionnels et 17 % des VFR avant l’épidémie contre respectivement 31 %, 26 % et 43 % après. Concernant les longs séjours, les expatriations, tout en restant stables, en représentent la quasi-totalité (86 %) vs 60 % avant l’épidémie, la part des tours du monde ayant fondu. Parmi ces expatriés, 79 % le sont pour des raisons professionnelles après l’épidémie vs 59 % avant celle-ci, alors que les déplacements pour stage/études et volontariat international ont chuté de plus de 50 %. Conclusion L’épidémie de COVID-19 a eu un impact majeur sur les voyages internationaux et sur l’activité des CVI, avec une réduction des passages de 81 % dans notre centre. Cet effet a particulièrement touché le continent asiatique dont les pays ont maintenu le plus haut niveau de restrictions sur les voyages. L’impact sur les séjours vers l’Afrique a été moindre dans notre centre, témoignant probablement des voyages des VFR. Les expatriations professionnelles ne semblent avoir été que peu touchées. En revanche, les séjours de tourisme ont notablement diminué de même que l’âge des voyageurs, traduisant une nette chute des voyages des séniors.","Jidar, K.; Benabdelmoumen, G.; Lucet, C.; Poujol, P.; Kuhmel, L.; Leporrier, J.; Consigny, P.",Infectious Diseases Now,547,15

Although the value and effectiveness of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in severe respiratory illness from COVID-19 remains unclear at this time, there is emerging evidence suggesting that it could be utilized as an ultimate treatment in appropriately selected patients not responding to conventional care. We present a case of a 32-year-old COVID-19 positive male with a history of diabetes mellitus who was intubated for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's hypoxemia failed to improve despite positive pressure ventilation, prone positioning, and use of neuromuscular blockade for ventilator asynchrony. He was evaluated by a multidisciplinary team for considering ECMO for refractory ARDS. He was initiated on venovenous ECMO via dual-site cannulation performed at the bedside. Although his ECMO course was complicated by bleeding, he showed a remarkable improvement in his lung function. ECMO was successfully decannulated after 17 days of initiation. The patient was discharged home after 47 days of hospitalization without any supplemental oxygen and was able to undergo active physical rehabilitation. A multidisciplinary approach is imperative in the initiation and management of ECMO in COVID-19 patients with severe ARDS. While ECMO is labor-intensive, using it in the right phenotype and in specialized centers may lead to positive results. Patients who are young, with fewer comorbidities and single organ dysfunction portray a better prognosis for patients in which ECMO is utilized.","Rajdev, Kartikeya; Farr, Lyndie A; Saeed, Muhammad Ahsan; Hooten, Rorak; Baus, Joseph; Boer, Brian",J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,547,29

Yet, deep learning methods profoundly depend on a huge amount of annotated data which is time-consuming and costly. Though semi-supervised learning methods approach this problem by leveraging an abundant amount of unlabeled data along with a small amount of labeled data in the training process. Recently, MixUp regularizer [32] has been successfully introduced to semi-supervised learning methods showing superior performance [3]. MixUp augments the model with new data points through linear interpolation of the data at the input space. In this paper, we argue that this option is limited, instead, we propose ROAM, a random layer mixup, which encourages the network to be less confident for interpolated data points at randomly selected space. Hence, avoids over-fitting and enhances the generalization ability. We validate our method on publicly available datasets on whole-brain image segmentation (MALC) achieving state-of-the-art results in fully supervised (89.8%) and semi-supervised (87.2%) settings with relative improvement up to 2.75% and 16.73%, respectively.","Bdair, Tariq; Navab, Nassir; Albarqouni, Shadi",,547,15

En effet, outre les pneumopathies sévères qu’il induit le SARS-CoV-2 est responsable d’un grand nombre de complications et notamment de pneumothorax. La survenue de pneumothorax ou de pneumomédiastin chez des patients présentant une infection à SARS-CoV-2 est une complication rare mais grave pouvant mettre en jeu le pronostic vital. Suite à plusieurs cas de pneumothorax dans notre établissement nous avons réalisé une étude monocentrique rétrospective afin de mieux caractériser les facteurs associés à la survenue d’une telle complication. Matériels et méthodes Tous les patients hospitalisés pour la prise en charge d’une infection à SARS-CoV-2 entre deux mars 2020 et premier avril 2021 ayant présenté un pneumothorax étaient inclus. Les données démographiques (âge, sexe), les antécédents respiratoires (statut tabagique, BPCO/emphysème), le mode de ventilation et la prise en charge thérapeutiques étaient recueillis. Résultats Au total, 18 patients avec une infection à SARS-CoV-2 prouvée présentaient un pneumothorax. Le sex-ratio était d’une femme pour 17 hommes. L’âge moyen au moment du diagnostic était de 68 ans. Six (33,3 %) étaient âgés de moins de 60 ans. Dans notre cohorte, sept patients (38,8 %) étaient hospitalisés en service de médecine conventionnelle et 11 patients (61,1 %) étaient hospitalisés en réanimation. Le mode de ventilation était recueilli. Dix patients (55,5 %) étaient intubés et bénéficiaient d’une ventilation mécanique lors de la survenue du pneumothorax. Un patient était sous Optiflow® (5,5 %). Cinq (27,7 %) d’entre eux étaient traités par oxygénothérapie simple au masque ou aux lunettes. Deux patients (11,1 %) ont présenté un pneumothorax en air ambiant, sans assistance ventilatoire. La prise en charge thérapeutique consistait, pour la majorité des cas (14 patients, 77 %), en une pose de drain thoracique. Quatre patients (22,3 %) n’étaient pas drainés soit en raison de l’étendue minime du pneumothorax soit le risque opératoire ne permettait pas un tel geste. Par ailleurs, deux patients (11,1 %) présentaient des pneumothorax bilatéraux, tout deux survenus sous ventilation mécanique et un patient présentait un pneumomédiastin après Optiflow®. Concernant les facteurs prédisposant, un patient (5,5 %) présentait une bronchopneumopathie obstructive. Deux patients (11,1 %) présentaient un tabagisme actif. Sur les 18 patients analysés, huit (44,4 %) sont décédés durant l’hospitalisation. Conclusion Les pneumothorax en contexte d’infection à SARS-CoV-2 surviennent principalement chez les patients présentant une forme sévère de l’infection et ayant recours à une ventilation mécanique. Ce type de ventilation permet d’imposer des pressions expiratoires positives élevées pouvant se compliquer de pneumothorax lorsque les patients présentent un défaut de compliance secondaire à une fibrose. Néanmoins, des cas sous ventilation conventionnelle y compris sans oxygénothérapie sont possibles suggérant qu’une infection à SARS-CoV-2 pourrait être un facteur de risque indépendant de pneumothorax. De ce fait, toute aggravation du tableau respiratoire doit faire évoquer un pneumothorax.","Pierre, L.; Gerber, V.; Rieu, J.; Lemmet, T.; Ion, C.; Kayser, D.; Gravier, S.; Martinot, M.",Infectious Diseases Now,547,18

While public health guidelines advised continued provision of timely care for patients, disruption of safety-net health care and public fear have been proposed to be related to indirect deaths because of delays in presentation. We hypothesized that admissions for emergency general surgery (EGS) diagnoses would decrease during the pandemic and that mortality for these patients would increase. METHODS: A multicenter observational study comparing EGS admissions from January to May 2020 to 2018 and 2019 across 11 NYC hospitals in the largest public health care system in the United States was performed. Emergency general surgery diagnoses were defined using International Classification Diseases, Tenth Revision, codes and grouped into seven common diagnosis categories: appendicitis, cholecystitis, small/large bowel, peptic ulcer disease, groin hernia, ventral hernia, and necrotizing soft tissue infection. Baseline demographics were compared including age, race/ethnicity, and payor status. Outcomes included coronavirus disease (COVID) status and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1,376 patients were admitted for EGS diagnoses from January to May 2020, a decrease compared with both 2018 (1,789) and 2019 (1,668) (p < 0.0001). This drop was most notable after the stay-at-home mandate (March 22, 2020; week 12). From March to May 2020, 3.3%, 19.2%, and 6.0% of EGS admissions were incidentally COVID positive, respectively. Mortality increased in March to May 2020 compared with 2019 (2.2% vs. 0.7%); this difference was statistically significant between April 2020 and April 2019 (4.1% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Supporting our hypothesis, the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and subsequent stay-at-home mandate resulted in decreased EGS admissions between March and May 2020 compared with prior years. During this time, there was also a statistically significant increase in mortality, which peaked at the height of COVID infection rates in our population.

It continues to spread widely, as the world still lacks specific treatments and a vaccine for the virus. The scenario of COVID-19 in Yemen seems obscure due to the lack of adequate data, therefore, we developed an electronic questionnaire and distributed it online among Yemeni people. The aim of this study was to understand the COVID-19 epidemiological situation in Yemen better since there is currently limited published data and limited availability of COVID-19 testing. METHODOLOGY: A 34-question web-based survey was distributed on social media outlets targeting people in Yemen. Data aggregation, analysis, and visualization were performed using Tableau and Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: 2,341 individuals reported symptoms concerning for COVID-19 infection, with 25.4% reporting a chronic medical condition. Diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and immune deficiency were associated with increased severity of the disease, while obesity, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and liver disease were not. Only 37 individuals (1.6%) had a confirmatory COVID-19 PCR test. The presence of high fever, dyspnea, chest pain, and dysphagia were symptoms that tended to be correlated to worse clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides some important information about the early overspread of COVID-19 within the Yemeni community in May, June, and July of 2020. It shows that online questionnaires may help in collecting data about pandemics in resource-limited countries where testing availability is limited.","Dhabaan, Ghulam; Chahin, Abdullah; Buhaish, Abdulrahman; Shorman, Mahmoud",J Infect Dev Ctries,547,22

Aim of this study is to apply available AAR models to assess and critically appraise COVID-19 response of San Raffaele Scientific Institute, a large university hospital in Milan, Italy. METHODS: We designed an AAR based on the key-informant interview format, following the methodology proposed by the 2019 World Health Organization Guidance for AAR. After systematic assessment of the hospital reorganization, we conducted 36 semi-structured interviews to professionals with executive, clinical, technical and administrative roles. We designed an ad-hoc questionnaire exploring four areas: (i) staff management; (ii) logistics and supplies; (iii) COVID-19 diagnosis and clinical management; (iv) communication. RESULTS: Overall, the hospital response was evaluated as effective and sufficiently prompt. Participants stressed the relevance of: (i) strong governance and coordination; (ii) readiness and availability of healthcare personnel; (iii) definition of a model of care based on a multidisciplinary approach. Challenges were reported for communication management and staff training. CONCLUSIONS: This study is one of the first applications of the AAR to the COVID-19 response in hospital settings, which can be successfully adapted or scaled up to other settings in order to implement preparedness strategies for future public health emergencies.","Sorbello, Sebastiano; Bossi, Eleonora; Zandalasini, Camilla; Carioli, Greta; Signorelli, Carlo; Ciceri, Fabio; Ambrosio, Alberto; Zangrillo, Alberto; Odone, Anna",Int. j. health plann. manage,547,22

We aimed to explore the value of bedside LUS in patients with severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated lung injury. METHODS: Sixty-three severe and 33 critical hospitalized subjects with COVID-19 were enrolled in this study. Bedside LUS was performed in all subjects; chest computed tomography was performed on the same day as bedside LUS in 23 cases. The LUS protocol consisted of 12 scanning zones. LUS score based on B-lines and lung consolidation was evaluated. RESULTS: The most common abnormality of LUS was the various forms of B-lines, detected in 93 (96.9%) subjects; as the second most frequent abnormality, 80 (83.3%) subjects exhibited lung consolidation, mainly located in the posterior lung region. Twenty-four (25.0%) subjects had pleural line abnormalities, and 16 (16.7%) had pleural effusion; 78 (81.3%) subjects had &#8805; 2 abnormal LUS patterns, and 93 (96.9%) had bilateral lung involvement. The proportion of bilateral or unilateral lung consolidation and pleural effusion in the critical COVID-19 group were higher than that in the severe group (P < .05). The lung consolidation of critical subjects showed a marked increase in most lung areas, including bilateral lateral lung, posterior lung, and left anterior-inferior lung area. The median (interquartile range) LUS scores of critical cases were higher than those of severe cases: left: 14 (12-17) vs 7 (5-12); right: 14 (10-16) vs 8 (3-12); bilateral: 28 (23-31) vs 15 (8-22) (P < .001 for all). There was a good correlation between the LUS score and the chest computed tomography score (r = 0.887, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The most common abnormal LUS pattern in subjects with severe and critical COVID-19 pneumonia was B-lines, followed by lung consolidation. Bedside LUS can provide important information for pulmonary involvement in patients with COVID-19.","Kong, Shuangshuang; Wang, Jing; Li, Yuman; Tian, Ying; Yu, Cheng; Zhang, Danqing; Li, Hong; Zhang, Li; Pang, Xueqin; Xie, Mingxing",Respir Care,547,10

RECENT FINDINGS: Forty-four studies are included in this review. Between 11 and 73.4% of HCWs, mainly including physicians, nurses, and auxiliary staff, reported post-traumatic stress symptoms during outbreaks, with symptoms lasting after 1-3 years in 10-40%. Depressive symptoms are reported in 27.5-50.7%, insomnia symptoms in 34-36.1%, and severe anxiety symptoms in 45%. General psychiatric symptoms during outbreaks have a range comprised between 17.3 and 75.3%; high levels of stress related to working are reported in 18.1 to 80.1%. Several individual and work-related features can be considered risk or protective factors, such as personality characteristics, the level of exposure to affected patients, and organizational support. Empirical evidence underlines the need to address the detrimental effects of epidemic/pandemic outbreaks on HCWs' mental health. Recommendations should include the assessment and promotion of coping strategies and resilience, special attention to frontline HCWs, provision of adequate protective supplies, and organization of online support services.","Preti, Emanuele; Di Mattei, Valentina; Perego, Gaia; Ferrari, Federica; Mazzetti, Martina; Taranto, Paola; Di Pierro, Rossella; Madeddu, Fabio; Calati, Raffaella",Curr Psychiatry Rep,547,16

The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for the complications and death in women of childbearing age and pregnant women with suspected COVID-19. Methods: This retrospective cohort study was conducted from the beginning of the epidemic in Mexico until May 25, 2020. All women of childbearing age (13-49 years) from the open national COVID-19 database from the Ministry of Health of Mexico were considered for eligibility. SARS-COV-2 infection was confirmed or ruled out by RT-qPCR. We performed a bivariate and multivariable analysis to estimate mortality risk. Results: Ten (2.2%) pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 died. Positive pregnant patients did not have a higher risk of complications (admission to the ICU, pneumonia, or requirement for mechanical ventilation) or death than the controls. In the multivariate analysis, only history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease remained independently associated with death in the positive cohort. Seven (0.6%) pregnant women with a negative test died. In bivariate analysis, pregnant patients with a positive test had a higher risk of death than pregnant patients with a negative test (relative risk (RR) = 3.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.48-10.12), but no higher risk was found than in non-pregnant women with a positive test (RR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.44-1.53), and 60-day mortality did not significantly differ among pregnant patients with or without a positive test (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.12-1.30) or between COVID-19-positive patients who were pregnant or not pregnant (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.35-1.56). Conclusions: Pregnant patients do not have a greater risk of complications or death from COVID-19 than non-pregnant patients. The presence of diabetes mellitus and chronic disease increases the risk of death in women of childbearing age, but not specifically in pregnant patients.","Ríos-Silva, Mónica; Murillo-Zamora, Efrén; Mendoza-Cano, Oliver; Trujillo, Xóchitl; Huerta, Miguel",J Glob Health,547,30

SUMMARY: PPE shortages impacted hospitals throughout the nation in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic response. The PPE requirement for sterile compounding and need to maintain supplies within the pharmacy cleanroom is often overlooked. A sustained supply of PPE is critical to ensure an uninterrupted supply of compounded medications to our patient population. Multiple conservation strategies, including staffing changes, communication, adjustments to training, and even reuse of select PPE, can assist with conservation. CONCLUSION: PPE in pharmacy cleanrooms is critical for the continued provision of sterile compounds with appropriate beyond-use dates and effective patient care. Pharmacy departments must employ multiple conservation strategies to ensure PPE is available for continued compounding of sterile products, and early planning and implementation of conservation strategies are key.","Wollitz, Amanda Danielle; Hong, Christine; Blanco, Fernando",Am. j. health system pharm,547,6

Together, these imply approximately 96-98% cases in Delhi remained unreported (July 10, 2020). Updated calculations using training data during March 15-December 31, 2020 yield estimated underreporting factor for cases at 13-22 (deaths: 3-7) on January 23, 2021, which are again consistent with the latest (fifth) round of serosurveys for Delhi (done during January 15-23, 2021) with an estimated 56.13% IgG antibody prevalence, yielding an estimated range for the underreporting factor for cases at 17-21.

Many serological tests have been developed to detect Abs against SARS-CoV-2. However, these tests have considerable variations in their specificity and sensitivity, and whether they can predict levels of neutralizing activity is yet to be determined. This study aimed to investigate the kinetics and neutralizing activity of various Ag-specific Ab isotypes against SARS-CoV-2 in serum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients confirmed via PCR test. We developed IgG, IgM, and IgA measurement assays for each Ag, including receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) protein, S1 domain, full-length S protein, S trimer, and nucleocapsid (N) domain, based on ELISA. The assays of the S protein for all isotypes showed high specificity, whereas the assays for all isotypes against N protein showed lower specificity. The sensitivity of all Ag-specific Ab isotypes depended on the timing of the serum collection and all of them, except for IgM against N protein, reached more than 90% at 15-21 d postsymptom onset. The best correlation with virus-neutralizing activity was found for IgG against RBD, and levels of IgG against RBD in sera from four patients with severe COVID-19 increased concordantly with neutralizing activity.

An ultrasound examination of the thorax is widely performed on admission in these patients. The primary objective of our study was to assess the performance of the lung ultrasound score (LUS) on ICU admission to predict the 28-day mortality rate in patients with SARS-CoV-2. The secondary objective was to asses the performance of thoracic ultrasound and biological markers of cardiac injury to predict mortality. METHODS: This multicentre, retrospective, observational study was conducted in six ICUs of four university hospitals in France from 15 March to 3 May 2020. Patients admitted to ICUs because of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory failure and those who received an LUS examination at admission were included. The area under the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve was determined for the LUS score to predict the 28-day mortality rate. The same analysis was performed for the Simplified Acute Physiology Score, left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac output, brain natriuretic peptide and ultra-sensitive troponin levels at admission. RESULTS: In 57 patients, the 28-day mortality rate was 21%. The area under the ROC curve of the LUS score value on ICU admission was 0.68 [95% CI 0.54-0.82; p = 0.05]. In non-intubated patients on ICU admission (n = 40), the area under the ROC curves was 0.84 [95% CI 0.70-0.97; p = 0.005]. The best cut-off of 22 corresponded to 85% specificity and 83% sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: LUS scores on ICU admission for SARS-CoV-2 did not efficiently predict the 28-day mortality rate. Performance was better for non-intubated patients at admission. Performance of biological cardiac markers may be equivalent to the LUS score.","Duclos, Gary; Bazalguette, Florian; Allaouchiche, Bernard; Mohammedi, Neyla; Lopez, Alexandre; Gazon, Mathieu; Besch, Guillaume; Bouvet, Lionel; Muller, Laurent; Mathon, Gauthier; Arbelot, Charlotte; Boucekine, Mohamed; Leone, Marc; Zieleskiewicz, Laurent",Adv Ther,547,5

METHODS: A rapid, systematic review was conducted to elucidate existing safety planning strategies used during public health emergencies. These were supplemented with strategies from an expert panel. A survey of IPV survivors and service providers gauged the helpfulness of each strategy during COVID-19. RESULTS: Together, the systematic review and expert panel yielded 26 conceptually distinct strategies, which were evaluated by 111 IPV survivors and providers. Of these, 19 (69%) were 'highly recommended', 3 (12%) were 'somewhat recommended' and 6 (23%) were not recommended for use during the COVID-19 pandemic because they might make the violence worse. CONCLUSIONS: Safety planning needs have changed owing to the effect of COVID-19 on IPV incidence, service provision and risk factors, as well as policies restricting freedom of movement. These results will be used to modify an existing IPV safety planning mobile application for use during COVID-19 and future public health emergencies.","Metheny, N; Perri, M; Velonis, A; Kamalanathan, J; Hassan, M; Buhariwala, P; Du Mont, J; Mason, R; O039,; Campo, P",Public Health,547,24

The recommended temperature for storage of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs ranges between 2-30 °C. In the global South, mean temperatures can exceed 30 °C. In the global North, Ag-RDTs are often used in external testing facilities at low ambient temperatures. We assessed analytical sensitivity and specificity of eleven commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using different storage and operational temperatures, including short- or long-term storage and operation at recommended temperatures or at either 2-4 °C or at 37 °C. The limits of detection of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs under recommended conditions ranged from 1.0×106- 5.5×107 genome copies/mL of infectious SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant. Despite long-term storage at recommended conditions, 10 min pre-incubation of Ag-RDTs and testing at 37 °C resulted in about ten-fold reduced sensitivity for five out of 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs, including both Ag-RDTs currently listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization. After 3 weeks of storage at 37 °C, eight of the 11 SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs exhibited about ten-fold reduced sensitivity. Specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs using cell culture supernatant from common respiratory viruses was not affected by storage and testing at 37 °C, whereas false-positive results occurred at outside temperatures of 2-4 °C for two out of six tested Ag-RDTs, again including an Ag-RDT recommended by the WHO. In summary, elevated temperatures impair sensitivity, whereas low temperatures impair specificity of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs. Consequences may include false-negative test results at clinically relevant virus concentrations compatible with transmission and false-positive results entailing unwarranted quarantine assignments. Storage and operation of SARS-CoV-2 Ag-RDTs at recommended conditions is essential for successful usage during the pandemic.","Haage, Verena; Ferreira de Oliveira-Filho, Edmilson; Moreira-Soto, Andres; Kühne, Arne; Fischer, Carlo; Sacks, Jilian A; Corman, Victor Max; Müller, Marcel A; Drosten, Christian; Drexler, Jan Felix",J Clin Virol,547,16

METHODS: A kidney transplant center in Central Italy implemented a strategy to maintain follow-up of kidney transplant recipients by phone and e-mail during lockdown. Telephone interviews were used to administer a clinical questionnaire to patients, and e-mail was used to receive the results of diagnostic tests conducted in outpatient settings. RESULTS: From March 17 to April 23, 2020, a total of 143 kidney transplant recipients were contacted. Twenty-eight patients needed in-hospital consultation for problems unrelated to COVID-19, 3 of whom needed hospitalization. Eleven patients were managed at home for mild urinary or respiratory diseases, and 1 was referred to the hematologist. We identified 2 suspected cases of COVID-19 infection, and the patients were referred to hospital care.

Due to the high importance of environmental conditions on human life quality, it is crucial to model the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on environmental conditions. Consequently, the objective of this study was to model the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the urban surface ecological status (USES). To this end, the Landsat-8 images of Milan for three pre-lockdown dates (Feb 13, 2018 (MD1), April 18, 2018 (MD2) and Feb 3, 2020 (MD3)) and one date over the lockdown (April 14, 2020 (MD4)), and Wuhan for three pre-lockdown dates (Dec 17, 2017 (WD1), March 23, 2018 (WD2) and Dec 7, 2019 (WD3)) and one lockdown date (Feb 9, 2020 (WD4)) were used. First, pressure-state-response (PSR) framework parameters including index-based built-up index (IBI), vegetation cover (VC), vegetation health index (VHI), land surface temperature (LST) and Wetness were calculated. Second, by combining the PSR framework parameters based on comprehensive ecological evaluation index (CEEI), the USES were modeled on different dates. Thirdly, the USES during the COVID-19 lockdown was compared with the USES for pre-lockdown. The mean (standard deviation) of CEEI for Milan on MD1, MD2, MD3 and MD4 were 0.52 (0.12), 0.60 (0.19), 0.57 (0.13) and 0.45 (0.16), respectively. Also, these values for Wuhan on WD1, WD2, WD3 and WD4 were 0.63 (0.14), 0.67 (0.15), 0.60 (0.13) and 0.57 (0.13), respectively. Due to the lockdowns, the mean CEEI of built-up, bare soil and green spaces for Milan and Wuhan decreased by [0.18, 0.02, 0.08], [0.13, 0.06, 0.05], respectively. During the lockdown period, the USES improved substantially due to the reduction of anthropogenic activities in the urban environment.","Firozjaei, Mohammad Karimi; Fathololomi, Solmaz; Kiavarz, Majid; Arsanjani, Jamal Jokar; Homaee, Mehdi; Alavipanah, Seyed Kazem",J Environ Manage,547,5

As the circulating common cold coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 share some homologous sequences with SARS-CoV-2, beta-coronavirus cross-reactive T-cell responses could influence the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and the course of COVID-19. To investigate the role of beta-coronavirus cross-reactive T-cells, we analyzed the T-cell response against a 15 amino acid long peptide (SCoV-DP15: DLSPRWYFYYLGTGP) from the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein sequence with a high homology to the corresponding sequence (QLLPRWYFYYLGTGP) in OC43 and HKU1. SCoV-DP15-specific T-cells were detected in 4 out of 23 (17.4%) SARS-CoV-2-seronegative healthy donors. As HIV-1 infection is a potential risk factor for COVID-19, we also studied a cohort of HIV-1-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy. 44 out of these 116 HIV-1-infected patients (37.9%) showed a specific recognition of the SCoV-DP15 peptide or of shorter peptides within SCoV-DP15 by CD4+ T-cells and/or by CD8+ T-cells. We could define several new cross-reactive HLA-I-restricted epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein such as SPRWYFYYL (HLA-B*07, HLA-B*35), DLSPRWYFYY (HLA-A*02), LSPRWYFYY (HLA-A*29), WYFYYLGTGP and WYFYYLGT. Epitope specific CD8+ T-cell lines recognized corresponding epitopes within OC43 and HKU1 to a similar degree or even at lower peptide concentrations suggesting that they were induced by infection with OC43 or HKU1. Our results confirm that SARS-CoV-2-seronegative subjects can target SARS-CoV-2 not only by beta-coronavirus cross-reactive CD4+ T-cells but also by cross-reactive CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells (CTL). The delineation of cross-reactive T-cell epitopes contributes to an efficient epitope-specific immunomonitoring of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells. Further prospective studies are needed to prove a protective role of cross-reactive T-cells and their restricting HLA alleles for control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The frequent observation of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T-cells in HIV-1-infected subjects could be a reason that treated HIV-1 infection does not seem to be a strong risk factor for the development of severe COVID-19.","Schmidt, Katja G; Nganou-Makamdop, Krystelle; Tenbusch, Matthias; El Kenz, Boutaina; Maier, Clara; Lapuente, Dennis; Überla, Klaus; Spriewald, Bernd; Bergmann, Silke; Harrer, Ellen G; Harrer, Thomas",Front Immunol,547,20

According to the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, it can be classified into mild, moderate, severe and critical ones. The treatment for critical cases is an important factor of reducing the mortality rate of the disease and is always dependent on the intensive care unit (ICU). The ICU therapy strategies involve not only curing the critical cases, but also avoiding cross infection in the same ward. Therefore, we have formulated detailed response management strategies, including the establishment of core groups, standardization of diagnosis and treatment process, strengthening personnel management, multimodal training assessment, and overall allocation of protection materials.

Prior studies have demonstrated that patients with respiratory viral infections may have transient lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia. Leukocyte parameters including lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) have been reported as screening tools for viral infections. Platelet counts and dynamics have been described as quantitative traits for ARDS risk and mortality. Therefore, we hypothesized that early hematologic parameters including lymphocyte count, monocyte count, platelet count, NLR, and LMR may distinguish viral from bacterial pulmonary sepsis. Methods: We enrolled 1,158 critically ill patients with pulmonary sepsis from 2009 to 2020 and measured lymphocyte count, monocyte count, platelet count, NLR, and LMR on ICU admission and at 24-hrs. Respiratory viruses were detected via PCR panel on nasopharyngeal swabs. Pulmonary sepsis was adjudicated by a physician panel. APACHE III scores were collected during the first 24-hrs. Shock was assessed by vasopressor use or mean arterial pressure &lt;65mmHg despite 30cc/kg fluid resuscitation. ARDS was defined per Berlin criteria. We assessed mortality at 30 days. We used multivariable linear regression to test the association between each of the laboratory studies and a positive respiratory pathogen panel (RVP) adjusting for APACHE III score, age, sex, malignancy, and race. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess for associations between a positive RVP and outcomes. Results: The incidence of respiratory virus detection was 33.9%. The incidence of ARDS and mortality were 52.7% and 49.0%, respectively. The most commonly detected pathogens were SARS-CoV-2 and rhinovirus (Table 1). Lower platelet counts at 24-hrs were significantly associated with respiratory virus detection (β-41.59 × 109/L [95%CI-79.03,-4.15], p=0.03), whereas admission platelet counts were not significantly associated (β-22.38 × 109/L [95%CI-63.26, 20.49], p=0.32). The significant association at 24-hrs was also present on sensitivity analyses excluding patients with SARS-CoV-2. There were no statistically significant differences between the populations with respect to lymphocyte count, monocyte count, NLR, LMR, ARDS, shock, and mortality. Conclusion: Lower early platelet counts were identified in patients with viral pulmonary sepsis. Although LMR and NLR have been reported as screening tools for viral infections in non-critically ill populations, we did not detect significant associations between lymphocyte count, monocyte count, NLR or LMR and viral detection in pulmonary sepsis. Our findings suggest that platelet counts in combination with other validated parameters may warrant further investigation for the early discrimination of viral versus bacterial pulmonary sepsis.","Jones, T.

We examined the impact of time to intubation and use of high-flow nasal cannula on clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Six coronavirus disease 2019-specific ICUs across four university-affiliated hospitals in Atlanta, Georgia. PATIENTS: Adults with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection who received high-flow nasal cannula or mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 231 patients admitted to the ICU, 109 (47.2%) were treated with high-flow nasal cannula and 97 (42.0%) were intubated without preceding high-flow nasal cannula use. Of those managed with high-flow nasal cannula, 78 (71.6%) ultimately received mechanical ventilation. In total, 175 patients received mechanical ventilation; 44.6% were female, 66.3% were Black, and the median age was 66 years (interquartile range, 56-75 yr). Seventy-six patients (43.4%) were intubated within 8 hours of ICU admission, 57 (32.6%) between 8 and 24 hours of admission, and 42 (24.0%) greater than or equal to 24 hours after admission. Patients intubated within 8 hours were more likely to have diabetes, chronic comorbidities, and higher admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores. Mortality did not differ by time to intubation (&#8804; 8 hr: 38.2%; 8-24 hr: 31.6%; &#8805; 24 hr: 38.1%; p = 0.7), and there was no association between time to intubation and mortality in adjusted analysis. Similarly, there was no difference in initial static compliance, duration of mechanical ventilation, or ICU length of stay by timing of intubation. High-flow nasal cannula use prior to intubation was not associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019, neither time from ICU admission to intubation nor high-flow nasal cannula use were associated with increased mortality. This study provides evidence that coronavirus disease 2019 respiratory failure can be managed similarly to hypoxic respiratory failure of other etiologies.","Hernandez-Romieu, Alfonso C; Adelman, Max W; Hockstein, Maxwell A; Robichaux, Chad J; Edwards, Johnathan A; Fazio, Jane C; Blum, James M; Jabaley, Craig S; Caridi-Scheible, Mark; Martin, Greg S; Murphy, David J; Auld, Sara C",Crit Care Med,547,24

However, adopting proper waste management and the right technologies, looking in a different perception of the current crisis would be an opportunity. About 40% of the plastic waste ended up in landfill, 25% incinerated, 16% recycled and the remaining 19% are leaked into the environment. The increase of plastic wastes and demand of plastic markets serve as a good economic indicator for investor and government initiative to invest in technologies that converts plastic waste into value-added product such as fuel and construction materials. This will close the loop of the life cycle of plastic waste by achieving a sustainable circular economy.

APPROACH AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective study on patients with AIH and COVID-19 from 34 centers in Europe and the Americas. We analyzed factors associated with severe COVID-19 outcomes, defined as the need for mechanical ventilation, intensive care admission, and/or death. The outcomes of patients with AIH were compared to a propensity score-matched cohort of patients without AIH but with chronic liver diseases (CLD) and COVID-19. The frequency and clinical significance of new-onset liver injury (alanine aminotransferase > 2 × the upper limit of normal) during COVID-19 was also evaluated. We included 110 patients with AIH (80% female) with a median age of 49 (range, 18-85) years at COVID-19 diagnosis. New-onset liver injury was observed in 37.1% (33/89) of the patients. Use of antivirals was associated with liver injury (P = 0.041; OR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.05-10.78), while continued immunosuppression during COVID-19 was associated with a lower rate of liver injury (P = 0.009; OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.09-0.71). The rates of severe COVID-19 (15.5% versus 20.2%, P = 0.231) and all-cause mortality (10% versus 11.5%, P = 0.852) were not different between AIH and non-AIH CLD. Cirrhosis was an independent predictor of severe COVID-19 in patients with AIH (P < 0.001; OR, 17.46; 95% CI, 4.22-72.13). Continuation of immunosuppression or presence of liver injury during COVID-19 was not associated with severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This international, multicenter study reveals that patients with AIH were not at risk for worse outcomes with COVID-19 than other causes of CLD. Cirrhosis was the strongest predictor for severe COVID-19 in patients with AIH. Maintenance of immunosuppression during COVID-19 was not associated with increased risk for severe COVID-19 but did lower the risk for new-onset liver injury during COVID-19.","Efe, Cumali; Dhanasekaran, Renumathy; Lammert, Craig; Ebik, Berat; Higuera-de la Tijera, Fatima; Aloman, Costica; Riza Caliskan, Ali; Peralta, Mirta; Gerussi, Alessio; Massoumi, Hatef; Catana, Andreea M; Torgutalp, Murat; Purnak, Tugrul; Rigamonti, Cristina; Gomez Aldana, Andres Jose; Khakoo, Nidah; Kacmaz, Hüseyin; Nazal, Leyla; Frager, Shalom; Demir, Nurhan; Irak, Kader; Ellik, Zeynep Melekoglu; Balaban, Yasemin; Atay, Kadri; Eren, Fatih; Cristoferi, Laura; Batibay, Ersin; Urzua, Álvaro; Snijders, Romee; Kiyici, Murat; Akyildiz, Murat; Ekin, Nazim; Carr, Rotonya M; Harputluoglu, Murat; Hatemi, Ibrahim; Mendizabal, Manuel; Silva, Marcelo; Idilman, Ramazan; Silveira, Marina; Drenth, Joost P H; Assis, David N; Björnsson, Einar; Boyer, James L; Invernizzi, Pietro; Levy, Chyntia; Schiano, Thomas D; Ridruejo, Ezequiel; Wahlin, Staffan",Hepatology,547,2

This study documents the experiences of ten physiology educators from Australia, Canada, the U.S. and the U.K. as they rapidly transitioned to remote laboratories in March-July, 2020. They wrote reflective narratives that explored their experiences and attitudes about virtual laboratories before, during and after the transition to remote delivery. Thematic analysis of the reflections found that before COVID-19, few of the educators had utilized virtual laboratories, with most believing that virtual laboratories could not replace the in-person laboratory experience. In response to university lockdowns, the educators transitioned from traditional on-campus, in-person laboratories to off-campus, remote laboratories within a week or less. This transition was mainly achieved by using commercially available online laboratory software, home-made videos and sample experimental data (collected before COVID-19). Opportunities associated with the remote transition included new collaborations (local and international), the exploration of unfamiliar technologies and revisiting the laboratory course curriculum and structure. However, the experience also generated challenges including excessive workloads, lack of expertise, disparities in online and workspace access, academic integrity issues, educator/student stress, changes in learning outcomes and a perceived reduction in student engagement (particularly due to the loss of educator-student and student-student interactions). Despite these challenges, most of the educators planned on retaining successful aspects of the remote laboratories post-pandemic, particularly with a blended model of remote and in-person (on-campus) laboratories. This study concludes with recommendations and practical strategies for physiology educators as to how they can plan, develop, deliver and assess effective remote laboratories.","Choate, Julia Aguilar-Roca Nancy Beckett Elizabeth Etherington Sarah French Michelle Gaganis Voula Haigh Charlotte Scott Derek Sweeney Terrence Zubek John",The FASEB Journal,547,24

Diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is critical for understanding epidemiology, contract-tracing, case management, and to repress the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. Currently, the Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT)-based RT-PCR technique is a gold standard test used for routine diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. While there are many commercially available RT-PCR assay kits available in the market, selection of highly sensitive, specific, and validated assays is most crucial for the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 is extremely important in the disease and outbreak management. Development of rapid point of care tests with better sensitivity and specificity is the critical need of the hour as this will help accurate diagnosis and aid in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Early detection of viral infection greatly enhances implementation of specific public health intervention, such as infection control, environmental decontamination, and the closure of specific high-risk zones. Large-scale sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genome isolated from affected populations across the world needs to be carried to monitor mutations that might affect performance of molecular tests. Creation of genome repositories and open-source genetic databases for use by global researchers is clearly the way forward to manage COVID-19 outbreak and accelerate vaccine development.

Chilblains represents a good prognosis, occurring later in the disease course. No systemic coagulopathy was identified in any patient. Patients presenting with acral lesions should be isolated, and chilblains should be distinguished from thrombotic lesions (livedo racemosa, retiform purpura or ischemic acral necrosis).

Over the past few months, COVID-19 has developed into a worldwide pandemic, with over 400,000 documented cases globally as of March 24, 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, but has been shown to have effective human-to-human transmission. COVID-19 results in mild symptoms in the majority of infected patients, but can cause severe lung injury, cardiac injury, and death. Given the novel nature of COVID-19, no established treatment beyond supportive care exists currently, but extensive public-health measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented globally to curb the spread of disease, reduce the burden on healthcare systems, and protect vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying medical comorbidities. Since this is an emerging infectious disease, there is, as of yet, limited data on the effects of this infection on patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly so for those with congenital heart disease. We summarize herewith the early experience with COVID-19 and consider the potential applicability to and implications for patients with cardiovascular disease in general and congenital heart disease in particular.","Tan, WeiYi Aboulhosn J.",International Journal of Cardiology,547,9

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (the virus causing COVID-19) is known to use the receptor-binding domain (RBD) at viral surface spike (S) protein to interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on many human cell types. The RBD-ACE2 interaction is a crucial step to mediate the host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies indicate that the ACE2 interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has a higher affinity than its binding with the structurally identical S protein of SARS-CoV-1, the virus causing the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. However, the biophysical mechanism behind such binding affinity difference is unclear. This study utilizes combined single-molecule force spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation approaches to quantify the specific interactions between SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 RBD and ACE2. Depending on the loading rates, the unbinding forces between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 range from 70 to 105 pN and are 30-40% higher than those of SARS-CoV-1 RBD and ACE2 under similar loading rates. SMD results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 RBD interacts with the N-linked glycan on Asn90 of ACE2. This interaction is mostly absent in the SARS-CoV-1 RBD-ACE2 complex. During the SMD simulations, the extra RBD-N-glycan interaction contributes to a greater force and prolonged interaction lifetime. The observation is confirmed by our experimental force spectroscopy study. After removing N-linked glycans on ACE2, its mechanical binding strength with SARS-CoV-2 RBD decreases to a similar level of the SARS-CoV-1 RBD-ACE2 interaction. Together, the study uncovers the mechanism behind the difference in ACE2 binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 and could help develop new strategies to block SARS-CoV-2 entry.","Cao, Wenpeng; Dong, Chuqiao; Kim, Seonghan; Hou, Decheng; Tai, Wanbo; Du, Lanying; Im, Wonpil; Zhang, X Frank",Biophys J,547,24

In the last twenty years, we have witnessed several viral epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 and most recently Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). There were tremendous efforts endeavoured globally by scientists to combat these viral diseases and now for SARS-CoV-2. Several drugs such as chloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, favipiravir and dexamethasone are adopted for use against COVID-19 and currently clinical studies are underway to test their safety and efficacy for treating COVID-19 patients. As per World Health Organization reports, so far more than 16 million people are affected by COVID-19 with a recovery of close to 10 million and deaths at 600,000 globally. SARS-CoV-2 infection is reported to cause extensive pulmonary damages in affected people. Given the large number of recoveries, it is important to follow-up the recovered patients for apparent lung function abnormalities. In this review, we discuss our understanding about the development of long-term pulmonary abnormalities such as lung fibrosis observed in patients recovered from coronavirus infections (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) and probable epigenetic therapeutic strategy to prevent the development of similar pulmonary abnormalities in SARS-CoV-2 recovered patients. In this regard, we address the use of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors therapy to manage pulmonary fibrosis and their underlying molecular mechanisms in managing the pathologic processes in COVID-19 recovered patients.","P, Krishna Murthy; Sivashanmugam, Karthikeyan; Kandasamy, Mahesh; Subbiah, Rajasekaran; Ravikumar, Vilwanathan",Life Sci,547,33

METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 300 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, mastectomy with breast reconstruction and PMRT at our institution from 2000 to 2017. Reconstruction types included autologous flaps (AR), single-stage-direct-to-implant and two-stages expander/implant (TE/I). The primary endpoint was the rate of reconstruction complications including infection, skin and fat necrosis. Subgroup analysis compared rates of capsular contracture, implant rupture, implant exposure and overall implant failure in single-stage-direct-to-implant to TE/I. The secondary endpoint was identifying the time interval between surgery with immediate implant-based reconstruction and PMRT associated with lower probability of implant failure. Logistic regression models, Kaplan-Meier estimates and Polynomial regression were used to assess endpoints. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 43.5 months. 29.3%, 28.3% and 42.4% of the cohort had AR, TE/I and single-stage-direct-to-implant D, respectively. The 5-year cumulative incidence rate of complications was 14.0%, 29.7% and 19.4% for AR, TE/I and single-stage-direct-to-implant, respectively (Log rank p = 0.02). Multivariate analysis showed significant association between TE/I and higher risk of infection (OR 8.1, p = 0.009) compared to AR, while single-stage-direct-to-implant and AR were comparable (OR 3.2, p = 0.2). On subgroup analysis, TE/I was significantly associated with higher rates of implant failure. The mean wait time to deliver PMRT after immediate reconstruction with no adjuvant chemotherapy was 8.4 and 10.7 weeks in single-stage-direct-to-implant and TE/I, respectively (p < 0.005). Delivering PMRT after 8 weeks of surgery yielded 10% probability of reconstruction failure in single-stage-direct-to-implant versus 40% in TE/I. CONCLUSION: In comparison to two stages reconstruction, single-stage-direct-to-implant following neoadjuvant chemotherapy has lower complications and offers timely delivery of PMRT.","Naoum, George E; Oladeru, Oluwadamilola T; Niemierko, Andrzej; Salama, Laura; Winograd, Jonathan; Colwell, Amy; Arafat, Waleed O; Smith, Barbara; Ho, Alice; Taghian, Alphonse G",Breast Cancer Res Treat,547,16

More than 50 different transcripts can be generated from a single HIV-1 unspliced pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) and a balanced proportion of unspliced and spliced transcripts is critical for the production of infectious virions. Understanding the mechanisms involved in the regulation of viral RNA is therefore of potential therapeutic interest. However, monitoring the regulation of alternative splicing events at a transcriptome-wide level during cell infection is challenging. Here we used the long-read cDNA sequencing developed by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) to explore in a quantitative manner the complexity of the HIV-1 transcriptome regulation in infected primary CD4+ T cells. RESULTS: ONT reads mapping to the viral genome proved sufficiently long to span all possible splice junctions, even distant ones, and to be assigned to a total of 150 exon combinations. Fifty-three viral RNA isoforms, including 14 new ones were further considered for quantification. Relative levels of viral RNAs determined by ONT sequencing showed a high degree of reproducibility, compared favourably to those produced in previous reports and highly correlated with quantitative PCR (qPCR) data. To get further insights into alternative splicing regulation, we then compiled quantifications of splice site (SS) usage and transcript levels to build ""splice trees"", a quantitative representation of the cascade of events leading to the different viral isoforms. This approach allowed visualizing the complete rewiring of SS usages upon perturbation of SS D2 and its impact on viral isoform levels. Furthermore, we produced the first dynamic picture of the cascade of events occurring between 12 and 24 h of viral infection. In particular, our data highlighted the importance of non-coding exons in viral RNA transcriptome regulation. CONCLUSION: ONT sequencing is a convenient and reliable strategy that enabled us to grasp the dynamic of the early splicing events modulating the viral RNA landscape in HIV-1 infected cells.","Nguyen Quang, Nam; Goudey, Sophie; Ségéral, Emmanuel; Mohammad, Ammara; Lemoine, Sophie; Blugeon, Corinne; Versapuech, Margaux; Paillart, Jean-Christophe; Berlioz-Torrent, Clarisse; Emiliani, Stéphane; Gallois-Montbrun, Sarah",Retrovirology,547,16

Third-party services have been known to take commissions out of the restaurant owners they partner with. However, restaurant owners complain that these rates have increased over the years, with zero reductions especially with slow business as a result of the pandemic. Delivery apps have not waivered their commissions, charging as high as 35% per order, which is not inclusive of a delivery fee for the consumer. The food industry is requesting third-party companies for a 10% reduction for each order, for them to be able to make ends meet. The paper encloses a survey conducted on restaurants in the U.A.E to assess the impact of commission rates by these delivery apps. The results showed that the restaurants are struggling to keep afloat, a factor that is bound to affect the employment of many staff members in these hotels. The paper, therefore, outlines the impact of these commission rates among other charges on restaurants and other food businesses in the United Arab Emirates.. © 2021 IEEE.","Dano, D.

For the optimal provision of early intervention, professionals in the field are required to have specialised knowledge and skills in implementing these programmes. In the context of South Africa, there is evidence to suggest that therapists are ill-prepared to handle the unique challenges posed in neonatal intensive care units and wards with at-risk infants in the first few weeks of life. This is attributed to several reasons; however, irrespective of the causative factors, the need to bridge this knowledge-to-practice gap remains essential. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a multimethod stakeholder-driven study using a scoping review followed by an appreciative inquiry and Delphi process that will aid in the development, implementation and evaluation of a knowledge translation intervention to bridge knowledge-gaps in occupational and physiotherapists working in the field. Therapists currently working in the public health sector will be recruited for participation in the various stages of the study. The analysis will occur via thematic analysis for qualitative data and percentages and frequencies for descriptive quantitative data. Issues around trustworthiness and rigour, and reliability and validity, will be ensured within each of the phases, by use of a content validity index and inter-rater reliability for the Delphi survey; thick descriptions, peer debriefing, member checking and an audit trail for the qualitative data. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has received full ethical approval from the Health Research and Knowledge Management Directorate of the Department of Health and a Biomedical Research Ethics Committee.

A study from Wuhan, China suggested the development of fibrosis, though it was too early to label these lung changes as irreversible fibrosis in a time range of 3 weeks. The occurrence of fibrosis indicates a chronic infection which greatly contributes to the hallmark symptom of COVID-19 induced ARDS such as shortness of breath and chest pain. However, many of those studies have not yet explained the condition of the patient's lung after total recovery from the COVID-19.

We performed a retrospective study to characterize pial arterial supply to dural arteriovenous fistulas and the implications for treatment. METHODS: Consecutive patients evaluated over a 12-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Angiograms were reviewed to characterize dAVF angioarchitecture and the presence of pial artery supply. Pial artery supply was categorized as dilated pre-existing dural branches and pure pial supply. We then studied the association between pial artery supply and clinical, angiographic, and treatment features. RESULTS: A total of 201 patients were included of which 27 (13.4%) had pial artery supply. Of these, 11 had supply from dilated pre-existing dural branches, nine had pure pial supply,and seven had both. There was a higher rate of dAVF rupture in the pial supply group (30.8% vs 9.8%, P=0.003) and these fistulas had a higher rate of Borden 2 and 3 (88.9% vs 38.4%, P<0.0001). Fistulas with pial artery supply had similar rates of endovascular and gamma knife treatment, but were more likely to undergo surgery than those without pial supply (25.9% vs 10.4%, P=0.03). Major complication rates were similar between groups (0% vs 1.1%, P=0.55). CONCLUSIONS: More than 10% of dAVFs also have pial supply but this is not a contraindication to embolization. In our study pure pial supply was associated with a more aggressive fistula and was most common in tentorial dAVFs.","Brinjikji, Waleed; Cloft, Harry J; Lanzino, Giuseppe",J. neurointerv. surg.

We hypothesized that the startle reflex component contained in E3 will decrease during vibration. METHODS: Sixteen healthy individuals were included in the study. CSP was recorded from slightly contracted right thenar muscles after painful index finger stimulation, before, during, and immediately after vibration. The values of the percentage change of E3 relative to pre-stimulus baseline (E3%) were compared before, during, and after vibration for each individual. RESULTS: There was a reduction in E3% during vibration and the values returned to normal immediately after vibration (153.1 ± 43.5%, 115.2 ± 30.2%, 154.9 ± 68.2%, respectively; p = 0.030). DISCUSSION: E3 is reduced during vibration in healthy individuals, presumably due to suppression of a reflex component, which is superimposed upon the known resynchronization of motoneurons.","Gündüz, Aysegül; Ayas, Selahattin; Kofler, Markus; Aydin, Senay; Kiziltan, Meral Erdemir",Neurol. sci,547,20

On an initial logical extrapolation, it appears probable that COVID-19 could mark the peak of Japanese activism.

METHODS: Seventy-nine COVID-19 patients, 78 healthy controls (HCs) and 30 COVID-19-like patients were recruited in a prospective cohort study. Samples were collected from COVID-19 patients with mild or severe symptoms on admission, patients who progressed from mild to severe symptoms, and patients who were followed from hospital admission to discharge. The metabolome was assayed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Serum butyric acid, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, l-glutamic acid, l-phenylalanine, l-serine, l-lactic acid, and cholesterol were enriched in COVID-19 and COVID-19-like patients versus HCs. Notably, d-fructose and succinic acid were enriched, and citric acid and 2-palmitoyl-glycerol were depleted in COVID-19 patients compared to COVID-19-like patients and HCs, and these four metabolites were not differentially distributed in non-COVID-19 groups. COVID-19 patients had enriched 4-deoxythreonic acid and depleted 1,5-anhydroglucitol compared to HCs and enriched oxalic acid and depleted phosphoric acid compared to COVID-19-like patients. A combination of d-fructose, citric acid and 2-palmitoyl-glycerol distinguished COVID-19 patients from HCs and COVID-19-like patients, with an area under the curve (AUC)â¯>â¯0.92 after validation.

METHODS: The redesigned curriculum included a structured project timeline, resident research in progress meetings, faculty mentorship, scholarly skills workshops, and mentored journal clubs. We conducted a curriculum evaluation via surveys of residents prior to implementation and after years 1 and 2, measuring satisfaction with the scholarly environment and opportunities, and confidence and participation in specific scholarly activities using Likert scales from 1 (least confidence) to 5. RESULTS: Compared to baseline (n=28), after 2 years (n=27) of the curriculum, residents reported increased mean confidence in critical appraisal of scientific articles (2.6±1.1 to 3.3±0.7, P=.007), carrying out a scholarly project (2.5±0.8 to 3.4±1.0, P=.005), and writing an abstract (3.0±0.8 to 3.8±0.7, P=.002).

Moreover, coherently with the echo chamber hypothesis, we find that users skewed towards one of the two categories of video channels (questionable, reliable) are more prone to use inappropriate, violent, or hateful language within their opponents community. Interestingly, users loyal to reliable sources use on average a more toxic language than their counterpart.

METHODS: Prezcobix/Rezolsta is a fixed-dose combination of 800 mg of the HIV protease inhibitor darunavir (DRV) and 150 mg cobicistat, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, which is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV infection. There are currently no definitive data on the safety and efficacy of DRV/cobicistat for the treatment of COVID-19. The in vitro antiviral activity of darunavir against a clinical isolate from a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 was assessed. RESULTS: DRV showed no antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 at clinically relevant concentrations (EC50 > 100 µM). Remdesivir, used as a positive control, demonstrated potent antiviral activity (EC50 = 0.38 µM).

To date, there is no curative treatment for COVID-19, and with vaccines only recently being rolled out predominantly in wealthy countries, prevention still remains the main strategy. Social distancing has been proven to mitigate the epidemic and limit disease spread. As is the case in many other countries, the Ethiopian government has declared a state of emergency and taken several measures to impose social distancing. The level of compliance with social distancing measures in Ethiopia is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the compliance, barriers, and facilitators to social distancing measures for the prevention of COVID-19 in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional survey using telephone interview triangulated by a qualitative study was conducted over a period of one month from April 20th to May 20th, 2020 at the University of Gondar Hospital in Gondar, Ethiopia. A total of 401 randomly selected participants, and 12 key representative informants selected by convenience were included for the quantitative and qualitative studies, respectively. Information on socio-demographic factors, knowledge about COVID-19, and practices concerning preventive measures--particularly social distancing--was collected. Respondents were asked what they thought were the barriers and facilitators of social distancing during in-depth face-to-face interviews. Data were entered and analyzed using Epi-data and Stata software, respectively. Frequencies and odds ratios were analyzed. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and a confidence level of 95% strength of association was used. Results: A total of 425 study subjects were approached and 401 responded positively (response rate of 94.4%). Of the 401 study participants, 55.4% (95% CI 50.4, 60.2) reported poor compliance with social distancing measures. The mean age of the participants was 36.4 years (SD ± 11.8). The majority of participants (63.84%) reported that they went to crowded places without putting on a face mask. Of the participants, 243 (60.6%) and 306 (76.3%) had good knowledge on COVID-19 transmission and prevention, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that only age (AOR= 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00-1.04) was significantly associated with social distancing measures, with older persons more likely than younger to comply with social distancing guidelines. Conclusion: The majority of the study's participants reported poor compliance with social distancing measures set by the government and health authorities. Reported compliance with social distancing measures was increased with increasing age.","Hailu, Workagegnehu; Derseh, Lemma; Hunegnaw, Melkamu Tamir; Tesfaye, Tsebaot; Abebaw, Dessie",Curr Ther Res Clin Exp,547,1

Exposure to infectious droplets confers a high risk for infection transmission by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Aerosolizing procedures pose particular concern for increasing healthcare workers' (HCWs) risks of infection. Multiple creative personal protective equipment solutions have been utilized to minimize exposure to infectious particles; however, the overall benefit of many of these devices is limited by a number of factors. Methods. We designed an intubation tent consisting of a metal frame and a clear plastic sheet. The flexible walls of our tent offer increased maneuverability & access, although the efficacy in reducing risk of transmission to HCWs remained unclear. Using an atomizer, particle generator, and matchstick smoke, we simulated the generation of infectious respiratory droplets and aerosols and tested whether our device effectively decreased the concentration of these particles to which a provider might be exposed. Finally, we tested whether the addition of a vacuum fan fit with a high efficiency particulate air filter designed to evacuate contaminated air would influence particle concentrations inside and outside the tent. Results. Droplet dispersion tests with the tent in place showed that the simulated droplet distribution was limited to surfaces within the tent. Aerosol testing under a variety of circumstances consistently showed only a minor rise in particle concentration in the air outside the tent despite an initial peak of particle concentration during generation within. All testing demonstrated declining inside concentrations over time. Conclusions. Our simulations suggest our device has the potential to effectively decrease HCWs' exposure to infectious droplets and aerosolized viral particles.","Brant-Zawadzki, Graham M; Ockerse, Patrick; Brunson, Justin R; Smith, Jared L; McRae, Bryan R; Fonnesbeck, Annie; Ledyard, Holly; Ruechel, Adam; Fassl, Bernhard A",Surg Innov,547,5

Concerns regarding vulnerability to infections and disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) and their complications have been raised. Recent published guidelines on the use of DMTs in relation to COVID-19 in MS patients have been diverse between countries with lack of evidence-based facts. In Sweden, there exists a particular interest in anti-CD20 therapy as a possible risk factor for severe COVID-19 due to the large number of rituximab-treated patients off-label in the country. Rapid responses from the Swedish MS Association (SMSS) and the Swedish MS registry (SMSreg) have resulted in national guidelines on DMT use for MS patients and implementation of a COVID-19 module in the SMSreg. Recently updated guidelines also included recommendations on COVID-19 vaccination with regard to the different DMTs. Social distancing policies forced implementation of telemedicine consultation to replace in-person consultations as part of regular MS health care. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in SMSreg have been useful in this respect.

For the prevention and control of infection, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control initiated testing of SARS-CoV-2 on January 24th 2020 for persons suspected with this disease. Until February 28th, 43 flu-like symptomatic patients were screened in China Medical University Hospital. METHODS: Two patients were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by rRT-PCR as COVID-19 patients A and B. Causative pathogens for included patients were detected using FilmArray&#8482; Respiratory Panel. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical presentations, laboratory data, radiologic findings, and travel and exposure contact histories, of the COVID-19 patients in comparison to those with other respiratory infections. RESULTS: Through contact with Taiwan No. 19 case patient on 27th January, COVID-19 patients A and B were infected. Both patients had no identified comorbidities and developed mild illness with temporal fever, persistent cough, and lung interstitial infiltrates. Owing to the persistence of positive SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory specimen, the two COVID-19 patients are still in the isolation rooms despite recovery until 10th of March. The results of FilmArrayTM Respiratory Panel revealed 22 of the 41 non-COVID-19 patients were infected by particular pathogens.

It is thought that COVID-19 may have both a direct and indirect effect on the cardiovascular system; however, the primary mechanism of underlying cardiovascular involvement is still uncertain. Of particular interest is the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is well known for its cardiovascular effects and is also considered to be important in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. With a range of different drug candidates being suggested, effective anti-virals and vaccines are an area of on-going research.

Kidney biopsy revealed collapsing glomerulopathy. Droplet-based digital polymerase chain reaction did not detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the biopsy fragment, and the virus was barely detectable in plasma at the time of the biopsy. SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia peaked several days later, followed by a seroconversion despite the absence of circulating CD19-positive lymphocytes at admission due to rituximab-based treatment of antibody-mediated rejection 3 months earlier. Genotyping for the 2 risk alleles of the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene revealed that the donor carried the low-risk G0/G2 genotype. This case illustrates that coronavirus disease 2019 infection may promote a collapsing glomerulopathy in kidney allografts with a low-risk APOL1 genotype in the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the kidney and that podocyte injury may precede SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia.","Lazareth, Hélène; Péré, Hélène; Binois, Yannick; Chabannes, Melchior; Schurder, Juliet; Bruneau, Thomas; Karras, Alexandre; Thervet, Eric; Rabant, Marion; Veyer, David; Pallet, Nicolas",Am J Kidney Dis,547,24

The objective of this study is to describe the experience of US family planning providers with the rapid adoption of telemedicine for contraceptive counseling during this period. STUDY DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional web-based survey of family planning providers practicing in the United States. RESULTS: A total of 172 providers completed the survey (34% response rate). Of these, 156 (91%) provided telemedicine services in the 2 months preceding the survey. Most (78%) were new to telemedicine. About half (54%) referred less than a quarter of contraception patients for in-person visits, and 53% stated that the most common referral reason was long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) insertion. A majority of providers strongly agree that telemedicine visits are an effective way to provide contraceptive counseling (80%), and that this service should be expanded after the pandemic (84%). If asked to provide telemedicine visits after the pandemic, 64% of providers would be very happy about it. Many providers used personal phones or smartphones to conduct telemedicine visits but stated that ideal devices would be work-issued computers, tablets, or phones. More than half (59%) of providers prefer video over phone visits. CONCLUSIONS: Family planning clinicians in the United States reported a positive experience with telemedicine for contraceptive counseling during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic and believe that this service should be expanded. Clinicians seem to prefer using work-issued devices and conducting video rather than phone visits.

The number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise which is a global burden on the health care system worldwide. Efforts are continuing to come up with a solution either to develop a small molecular inhibitor or vaccine, but still no success. In the fight against SARS-CoV-2, targeting a different protein of the SARS-CoV-2 is the need of the hour to impede and relinquish the current pandemic. Therefore, in this study, computational modelling and simulation approaches are used to target the N-terminal domain of the phosphor-nucleoprotein (RNA binding protein), which is primarily responsible for binding and packing the viral genome to get ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP). Our multi-step drug screening approach shortlisted potential drugs. These top hits were confirmed by re-docking which revealed that the interacting molecules block the key residues i.e. Thr57, His59, Ser105, Arg107, and Arg177 and thus ultimately block the NTD from RNA recognition. Furthermore, the activity of the top four hits was also confirmed by using molecular dynamics simulation and free energy calculation. Our analysis suggests that these top hits possess strong inhibitory properties and should be tested experimentally. In conclusion, we hope these top hits would abrogate the binding of RNA and the NTD of the SARS-CoV-2, which might be helpful to combat COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Whether regarding the viral genome, incubation periods, method of transmission, symptoms, dangerous behaviors, age groups at risk, all information was valuable, all data was shared as soon as possible. AREAS COVERED: Considering that the most severely impacted group of patients are already suffering from other conditions, accessing the impact that metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), obesity, and diabetes has on patients by sharing information between different healthcare facilities is of vital importance. However, the value behind open information sharing would remain significant even without a viral outbreak and should there be a more efficient infrastructure in place, the global exchange of data can become more practical and less arduous. EXPERT OPINION: Since the sharing of data by individual researchers is often motivated by personal benefits, this observed international collaboration is conditional at best, and the widespread misinformation during this pandemic could be an indication of a certain lack of consensus within the scientific community itself.","Rios, Rafael S; Zheng, Kenneth I; Zheng, Ming-Hua",Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol,547,1

The most common neurological symptoms are dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, ataxia, hypogosis, hyposmia, neuralgia and myalgia. The most common neurological diseases are acute cerebrovascular disease, epilepsy, acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy, miyelitis and Gullian Barre Syndrome. Methods: In this case report, a patient infected with Covid 19 and diagnosed as neuromyelitis optica (NMO) with anamnesis, clinical and radiological findings is presented. Results: A 50 years old woman presented with weakness of both legs, urine retention, high fever, and cough. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging revealed expensive long-segment and centrally located demyelinating lesion extending from the cervical cord (at the level of C3) to the conus. Thoracic computerized tomography revealed consolidation areas located on the lower segments of bilateral lungs and ground-glass density, air bronchograms, and peribronchial thickening surrounding these areas. Aquaporin-4 immune globulin-G was found to be positive. Conclusion: It was considered appropriate to present this case because of being the first case of parainfectious NMO considered to be induced by SARS-CoV-2. HIGHLIGHTS COVID-19 has neuro-invasion potential independently of the critical disease process Demyelinating lesions such as neuromyelitis optica may develop in the course of disease Parainfectious NMO induced by SARS-CoV-2 may occur as a result of extended immune response.","Batum, Melike; Kisabay Ak, Aysin; Mavioglu, Hatice",Int J Neurosci,547,32

Participants were adults aged between 20 and 69 years selected from 13 prefectures where the government declared the state of emergency from April to May 2020. All selected participants were shopping or cooking foods for more than 2 days a week at the time of the survey. A total of 2,299 participants were included in the analysis. Dietary consciousness was measured using 12 items, and the construct was examined using factor analysis. Cronbach's alpha was examined as an indicator of internal validity, and the criterion-referenced validity was confirmed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. To determine changes in dietary consciousness, we calculated total scores based on changes in each item of the Dietary Consciousness Scale as follows: no change (0 points), improved (+1 point), and worsening (-1 point). The associations between the changes in dietary consciousness and characteristics or socioeconomic factors of the participants were examined using the chi-squared test and residual analysis.ResultsãExploratory and confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that a model consisting of two factors fitted the data (GFI = 0.958, AGFI = 0.938, CFI = 0.931, RMSEA = 0.066). Cronbach's alpha of the first factor (importance of diet) was 0.838 and 0.734 for the second factor (precedence of diet), and the reliability was confirmed at 0.828 for the entire scale. In the examination of criterion-related validity, the higher the stage of change, the higher the total score of the scale, and a significant difference was observed (P<0.001). The percentage of participants whose precedence worsened was higher than the importance. Significant differences were observed regarding gender, age group, marital status, employment status, household annual income, and income change during the COVID-19 pandemic considering changes in both the importance and precedence of diet. Those who were in the ""worsening tendency"" group in both the importance and precedence were men, 20-29 years old, unmarried, full-time employees, with a household income of 4-6 million yen during the past year.ConclusionãDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the precedence of diet worsened, compared to its importance, and men, young, or unmarried persons show a worsening of dietary consciousness.","Hayashi, Fumi; Takemi, Yukari; Akaiwa, Yuki; Ishikawa, Hirono; Fukuda, Yoshiharu",Nippon koshu eisei zasshi,547,11

We describe the incidence of confirmed infection and hospitalisation of children and adolescents under the age of 20 in Norway, and specifically among those with underlying conditions. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The Norwegian Directorate of Health has collaborated with the Norwegian Institute of Public Health on the establishment of a data extraction system to monitor the coronavirus outbreak. Data from the specialist health service (Norwegian Patient Registry, NPR), and the primary health service (Norwegian Registry for Primary Health Care, NRPHC) are linked to data on positive SARS-CoV-2 tests from the Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS). This covers all persons living in Norway as of 1 March 2020, with data on confirmed infection up to and including 13 May 2020 and on hospitalisations up to and including 30 April 2020. RESULTS: Of 8 125 persons with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in the whole population, 493 (6.1 %) were under 20 years old. The median age of the under-20s was 15 years, and 252 (51 %) were girls. 3 % were hospitalised. No deaths were registered among patients aged under 20 in Norway. We found a somewhat larger share with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in the group with diseases of the neuromuscular system. INTERPRETATION: Few children and adolescents have had SARS-CoV-2 confirmed, and only a very few have been hospitalised. Underlying conditions may result in a lower threshold for testing, and hence a higher incidence of confirmed infection in this group, although higher risk cannot be excluded.","Størdal, Ketil; Bakken, Inger Johanne; Greve-Isdahl, Margrethe; Klingenberg, Claus; Helland, Eyvind; Nystad, Wenche; Hjellvik, Vidar; Gulseth, Hanne Løvdal",Tidsskr. nor. laegeforen.,547,1

The aim of our study was to adopt an integrated approach based on clinical, laboratory and chest x-ray (CXR) findings collected at the patient's admission to Emergency Room (ER) to identify prognostic factors. Retrospective study on 346 consecutive patients admitted to the ER of two North-Western Italy hospitals between March 9 and April 10, 2020 with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase reaction chain test (RT-PCR), CXR performed within 24 h (analyzed with two different scores) and recorded prognosis. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. Statistical analysis on the features of 83 in-hospital dead vs 263 recovered patients was performed with univariate (uBLR), multivariate binary logistic regression (mBLR) and ROC curve analysis. uBLR identified significant differences for several variables, most of them intertwined by multiple correlations. mBLR recognized as significant independent predictors for in-hospital mortality age > 75 years, C-reactive protein (CRP) > 60 mg/L, PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F) < 250 and CXR ""Brixia score"" > 7. Among the patients with at least two predictors, the in-hospital mortality rate was 58% against 6% for others [p < 0.0001; RR = 7.6 (4.4-13)].

AIM: To explore sources of influence (family health, media consumption, and loss of work hours) on COVID-19 protection motivation. METHOD: An online quantitative survey of U.S. adults (N = 501) aged 18 years or older was administered using Qualtrics with participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Data were collected on constructs related to the protection motivation theory and theory of planned behavior as well as sources of influence and intention to socially distance and socially isolate during COVID-19. Constructs were further defined through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Structural equation modeling was used to determine relationships between constructs. RESULTS: A two-factor model was identified with threat appraisal as one factor and subjective norms appraisal, coping appraisal, and behavioral intention loading as another factor. Higher news media consumption and loss of work hours due to COVID-19 were both significant predictors of increased threat appraisal. Family healthy lifestyle and family health resources were significantly related to increases in the subjective norms, coping appraisal, and behavioral intention appraisal factor. CONCLUSIONS: Family health, news media consumption, and loss of work hours are associated with COVID-19 protection motivation.

Early identification of patients at an increasing risk of death may avert adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to establish an early prediction model of fatal adverse prognosis of fever patients by extracting key indicators using big data technology. METHODS: A retrospective study of patients' data was conducted using the Emergency Rescue Database of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital. Patients were divided into the fatal adverse prognosis group and the good prognosis group. The commonly used clinical indicators were compared. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) method was used to determine the optimal number of the included variables. In the training model, logistic regression, random forest, adaboost and bagging were selected. We also collected the emergency room data from December 2018 to December 2019 with the same inclusion and exclusion criterion. The performance of the model was evaluated by accuracy, F1-score, precision, sensitivity and the areas under receiver operator characteristic curves (ROC-AUC). RESULTS: The accuracy of logistic regression, decision tree, adaboost and bagging was 0.951, 0.928, 0.924, and 0.924, F1-scores were 0.938, 0.933, 0.930, and 0.930, the precision was 0.943, 0.938, 0.937, and 0.937, ROC-AUC were 0.808, 0.738, 0.736, and 0.885, respectively. ROC-AUC of ten-fold cross-validation in logistic and bagging models were 0.80 and 0.87, respectively. The top six coefficients and odds ratio (OR) values of the variables in the Logistic regression were cardiac troponin T (CTnT) (coefficient=0.346, ORâ=â1.413), temperature (T) (coefficient=0.235, ORâ=â1.265), respiratory rate (RR) (coefficient= -0.206,ORâ=â0.814), serum kalium (K) (coefficient=0.137, ORâ=â1.146), pulse oxygen saturation (SPO2) (coefficient= -0.101, ORâ=â0.904), and albumin (ALB) (coefficient= -0.043, ORâ=â0.958). The weights of the top six variables in the bagging model were: CTnT, RR, lactate dehydrogenase, serum amylase, heartrate, and systolic blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The main clinical indicators of concern included CTnT, RR, SPO2, T, ALB and K. The bagging model and logistic regression model had better diagnostic performance comprehesively. Those may be conducive to the early identification of critical patients with fever by physicians.","Zhao, Chun-Hong; Wu, Hui-Tao; Che, He-Bin; Song, Ya-Nan; Zhao, Yu-Zhuo; Li, Kai-Yuan; Xiao, Hong-Ju; Zhai, Yong-Zhi; Liu, Xin; Lu, Hong-Xi; Li, Tan-Shi",Chin Med J (Engl),547,4

As an act of remembering the victims, Mexican journalists, writers, and activists created a digital altar: 72 Migrantes. Focusing on photography and narrative as visual frames of Blackness, this article analyzes the representation of Black bodies in the digital altar to conceptualize Blackness as: a constitutive part of violent landscapes;a symptom and supplement of that violence;and, conversely, the location itself from which to critique that violence. At stake is a call for Blackness to be read within hemispheric Latin Americanist visual studies as a locus for understanding antisociality and critical race theory by closely studying the role of the human, social death, and the aesthetics of remembrance. Over 10 years after the massacre, the arguments raised in this article both implicitly and explicitly underscore the need to conceptualize contemporary Blackness and death in the wake of the growing anti-racism activism, Black Lives Matter, and the disproportionate number of people of color who have died as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We reviewed published literature for evidence of an association between HCQ (with or without azithromycin (AZM)) and total mortality in COVID-19 patients.Methods: Articles were retrieved until April 29th, 2021 by searching in seven databases. Data were combined using the general-variance-based method.Results: A total of 25 cohort studies (N=41,339 patients) and 11 randomized clinical trials (RCTs; N=8,709) were found. The use of HCQ was not associated with mortality in meta-analysis of RCTs (pooled risk ratio (PRR): 1.08, 95%CI: 0.97-1.20; I2=0%), but it was associated with 20% lower mortality risk (PRR=0.80, 95%CI: 0.69-0.93; I2=80%) in pooling of cohort studies. The negative association with mortality was mainly apparent by pooling cohort studies that used lower doses of HCQ (&#8804;400 mg/day; PRR=0.69, 95%CI: 0.57-0.87). Use of HCQ+AZM (11 studies) was associated with 25% non-statistically significant lower mortality risk (PPR=0.75; 0.51-1.10; P=0.15). Use of HCQ was not associated with severe adverse events (PRR=1.12, 95%CI: 0.88-1.44; I2=0%).Conclusions: HCQ use was not associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients in pooling results from RCTs (high level of certainty of evidence), but it was associated with 20% mortality reduction when findings from observational studies were combined (low level of certainty of evidence). The reduction of mortality was mainly apparent in observational studies where lower doses of HCQ were used. These findings might help disentangling the debate on HCQ use in COVID-19.","Di Castelnuovo, Augusto; Costanzo, Simona; Cassone, Antonio; Cauda, Roberto; De Gaetano, Giovanni; Iacoviello, Licia",Pathog Glob Health,547,1

METHODS: This retrospective study included CXRs of COVID-19 patients that reported the Brixia score, a semi-quantitative scoring system rating lung involvement from 0 to 18. The highest (H) and lowest (L) values were registered along with scores on admission (A) and end of hospitalization (E). The Brixia score was correlated with the outcome (death or discharge). RESULTS: A total of 953 patients met inclusion criteria. In total, 677/953 were discharged and 276/953 died during hospitalization. A total of 524/953 had one CXR and 429/953 had more than one CXR. H-score was significantly higher in deceased (median, 12; IQR 9-14) compared to that in discharged patients (median, 8; IQR 5-11) (p < 0.0001). In 429/953 patients with multiple CXR, A-score, L-score, and E-score were higher in deceased than in discharged patients (A-score 9 vs 8; p = 0.039; L-score 7 vs 5; p < 0.0003; E-score 12 vs 7; p < 0.0001). In the entire cohort, logistic regression showed a significant predictive value for age (p < 0.0001, OR 1.13), H-score (p < 0.0001, OR 1.25), and gender (p = 0.01, male OR 1.67). AUC was 0.863. In patients with &#8805; 2 CXR, A-, L-, and E-scores correlated significantly with the outcome. Cox proportional hazards regression indicated age (p < 0.0001, HR 4.17), H-score (< 9, HR 0.36, p = 0.0012), and worsening of H-score vs A score > 3 (HR 1.57, p = 0.0227) as associated with worse outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The Brixia score correlates strongly with disease severity and outcome; it may support the clinical decision-making, particularly in patients with moderate-to-severe signs and symptoms. The Brixia score should be incorporated in a prognostic model, which would be desirable, particularly in resource-constraint scenarios.

Here, we report results of a descriptive, exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed as of February 11, 2020. Methods: All COVID-19 cases reported through February 11, 2020 were extracted from China's Infectious Disease Information System. Analyses included: 1) summary of patient characteristics; 2) examination of age distributions and sex ratios; 3) calculation of case fatality and mortality rates; 4) geo-temporal analysis of viral spread; 5) epidemiological curve construction; and 6) subgroup analysis. Results: A total of 72 314 patient records-44 672 (61.8%) confirmed cases, 16 186 (22.4%) suspected cases, 10567 (14.6%) clinical diagnosed cases (Hubei only), and 889 asymptomatic cases (1.2%)-contributed data for the analysis. Among confirmed cases, most were aged 30-79 years (86.6%), diagnosed in Hubei (74.7%), and considered mild/mild pneumonia (80.9%). A total of 1 023 deaths occurred among confirmed cases for an overall case-fatality rate of 2.3%. The COVID-19 spread outward from Hubei sometime after December 2019 and by February 11, 2020, 1 386 counties across all 31 provinces were affected. The epidemic curve of onset of symptoms peaked in January 23-26, then began to decline leading up to February 11. A total of 1 716 health workers have become infected and 5 have died (0.3%). Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic has spread very quickly. It only took 30 days to expand from Hubei to the rest of Mainland China. With many people returning from a long holiday, China needs to prepare for the possible rebound of the epidemic.",,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,547,4

Recent experience with CoV-2 infection and difficulties in prevention and therapy of COVID-19 point out the lack of specific antiviral drugs, leading to the use of repurposed drugs. A number of drugs, registered for various disorders for decades including antidepressants were considered in the prevention and treatment of COVID. Preclinical studies verified the antiviral effects of some antidepressants, first of all fluoxetine and fluvoxamine. These drugs inhibit the entry of viruses into the cell, arrest their intracellular pathway, and block their replication if used in the dose of usual human therapy, according to most of the studies. However, there are only a few in vivo studies available on the antiviral effects of antidepressants. According to observation of French clinicians in the course of the pandemia in COVID-19 therapy, epidemiological studies of the morbidity and mortality of patients on antidepressants, the association of SSRI use and reduced intubation and mortality confirm the results of in vitro trials in clinical practice. However, antidepressants are not yet registered for infectious diseases, their beneficial effects can be exploited in case of comorbidity or post-COVID syndrome.

A longitudinal study was carried out in April 2020 (T1) and December 2020 (T2). The participants were 172 health professionals from different health institutions and they reported their workload, fear of contagion, lack of staff and personal protection equipment (PPE), harmonious passion, STS and posttraumatic growth. The results revealed that workload and fear of contagion in T2 were positive predictors for STS, whereas harmonious passion was a negative predictor. Fear of contagion of both times seemed to positively predict posttraumatic growth, as well as harmonious passion. One moderation effect was found concerning the lack of staff/PPE, as posttraumatic growth was higher when the workload was high, especially in those with a high lack of staff/PPE. All in all, these findings pointed out the need for preventative measures to protect these professionals from long-term negative consequences.","Moreno-Jiménez, Jennifer E; Blanco-Donoso, Luis Manuel; Demerouti, Evangelia; Belda Hofheinz, Sylvia; Chico-Fernández, Mario; Moreno-Jiménez, Bernardo; Garrosa, Eva",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),547,20

Governments have responded with rapid and sometimes radical public health interventions. As nations grapple with the question of how to regain normality without unnecessarily endangering lives or healthcare systems, some scientists have argued for policies to encourage or compel the use of face coverings in community (non-clinical) settings, despite acknowledged gaps in the evidence base for the effectiveness of such a measure. This commentary has two objectives. First, in the face of strong arguments that face coverings are a commonsense intervention, with negligible downsides, that can only do good, we make the case for caution in changing policy. Many seemingly benign public health interventions have the potential to cause harm, and that harm is often socially differentiated. We present five arguments for caution in policy change. Second, we reflect on the wider implications of the increasingly overt approaches to policy advocacy taken by some scientists. Drawing from the theory of post-normal science, we argue that the science–policy interface in the case of face coverings has taken a surprisingly traditional form, falling short of interdisciplinary integration and failing to incorporate insights of the full range of relevant experts and affected stakeholders. We sketch a vision for an alternative, more mature, relationship between science and society that accepts uncertainty, embraces deliberation, and rises to the challenge of developing knowledge to improve public health.","Martin, Graham P.; Hanna, Esmée; McCartney, Margaret; Dingwall, Robert",Crit.

METHOD: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, the Spanish Official State Gazette and Eudralex. The websites of the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism and of the Ministry of Health, as well as the relevant UNE standards were also reviewed. RESULTS: The different types of face masks available on the market meet different regulatory requirements. Community masks are not considered medical devices or personal protective equipment and do not require marketing authorization. They do not carry a CE mark and need not comply with the general regulations applicable to consumer products. Surgical masks, for their part, must meet the quality criteria defined in UNE-EN standard 14683: 2019. According to Regulation (EU) 745/2017 they are class I devices, subject to an EU declaration of conformity, and must bear a CE mark. Filtering masks are considered category III personal protective equipment, regulated by Regulation (EU) 2016/425, and must also bear a CE mark. In spite the abundant regulations in place, market control instruments have detected counterfeit face masks, which means that public authorities and users should ask manufacturers or suppliers for additional information in case of doubt.

Decades of international research shows that, across Europe, men have shorter life expectancies and higher mortality rates than women, and yet, women report higher morbidity. These gender-based health inequalities also appear to be evident within the pandemic and its aftermath. The article starts by providing an overview of the 'gender health paradox' and the biological, social, economic and political explanations for it. It then outlines the international estimates of gender-based inequalities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates - where emerging data suggests that women are more likely to be diagnosed with COVID-19 but that men have a higher mortality rate. It then explores the longer term consequences for gender-based health inequalities of the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the impacts of government policy responses and the emerging economic crisis, suggesting that this might lead to increased mortality amongst men and increased morbidity amongst women. The essay concludes by reflecting on the pathways shaping gender-based health inequalities in the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses needed to ensure that it does not exacerbate gender-based health inequalities into the future.","Bambra, Clare; Albani, Viviana; Franklin, Paula",Scand J Public Health,547,20

The humoral immune response (HIR) of CP against SARS-CoV-2 is not well characterized. To better understand it, we conducted a serological study of hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 CP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Unicentric, retrospective study enrolling adult SARS-CoV-2 patients admitted to a central hospital from March 15 to June 17, 2020, whose serum samples were quantified for anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain or spike protein immunoglobulin (Ig) M, G and A antibodies. The aims of the study were to assess the HIR to SARS-CoV-2, correlate it with different cancer types, stages and treatments, clarify the interplay between HIR of CP and clinical outcomes and to compare the HIR of SARS-CoV-2 CP and NCP. RESULTS: We included 72 SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects (19 CP, 53 controls). About 90% of controls revealed a robust serological response. Among CP, a strong response was verified in 57.9% of them, with 42.1% showing a persistently weak response. Treatment with chemotherapy within 14 days before positivity was the only factor statistically shown to be associated with persistently weak serological responses among CP. No significant differences in outcomes were observed between CP with strong and weak responses. All IgG, IgM, IgA and total Ig antibody titers were significantly lower in CP when compared with NCP. CONCLUSIONS: A significant part of CP develops a proper HIR. Recent chemotherapy treatment may be associated with weak serological responses among CP.

IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our results place the spotlight on cancer patients, particularly the ones actively treated with chemotherapy. These patients may potentially be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, being important to provide oncologists further theoretical support (with concrete examples and respective mechanistic correlations) for the decision of starting, maintaining or stopping antineoplastic treatments (particularly chemotherapy) not only on non-infected but also on infected cancer patients in accordance with cancer type, stage and prognosis, treatment agents, treatment setting and SARS-CoV-2 infection risks.","Esperança-Martins, Miguel; Gonçalves, Lisa; Soares-Pinho, Inês; Gomes, Andreia; Serrano, Marta; Blankenhaus, Birte; Figueiredo-Campos, Patrícia; Catarina-Marques, Ana; Castro-Barbosa, Ana; Cardoso, Ana; Antunes-Meireles, Pedro; Atalaia-Barbacena, Henrique; Gaspar, Pedro; Howell-Monteiro, Patrícia; Pais-de-Lacerda, António; Mota, Catarina; Veldhoen, Marc",Oncologist,547,20

Objective: To evaluate neonatal outcomes in relation to maternal SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in pregnancy. Design, Setting, and Participants: Nationwide, prospective cohort study based on linkage of the Swedish Pregnancy Register, the Neonatal Quality Register, and the Register for Communicable Diseases. Ninety-two percent of all live births in Sweden between March 11, 2020, and January 31, 2021, were investigated for neonatal outcomes by March 8, 2021. Infants with malformations were excluded. Infants of women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were matched, directly and using propensity scores, on maternal characteristics with up to 4 comparator infants. Exposures: Maternal test positivity for SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. Main Outcomes and Measures: In-hospital mortality; neonatal resuscitation; admission for neonatal care; respiratory, circulatory, neurologic, infectious, gastrointestinal, metabolic, and hematologic disorders and their treatments; length of hospital stay; breastfeeding; and infant test positivity for SARS-CoV-2. Results: Of 88â¯159 infants (49.0% girls), 2323 (1.6%) were delivered by mothers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The mean gestational age of infants of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers was 39.2 (SD, 2.2) weeks vs 39.6 (SD, 1.8) weeks for comparator infants, and the proportions of preterm infants (gestational age <37 weeks) were 205/2323 (8.8%) among infants of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers and 4719/85â¯836 (5.5%) among comparator infants. After matching on maternal characteristics, maternal SARS-CoV-2 test positivity was significantly associated with admission for neonatal care (11.7% vs 8.4%; odds ratio [OR], 1.47; 95% CI, 1.26-1.70) and with neonatal morbidities such as respiratory distress syndrome (1.2% vs 0.5%; OR, 2.40; 95% CI, 1.50-3.84), any neonatal respiratory disorder (2.8% vs 2.0%; OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.07-1.90), and hyperbilirubinemia (3.6% vs 2.5%; OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.13-1.90). Mortality (0.30% vs 0.12%; OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 0.99-6.57), breastfeeding rates at discharge (94.4% vs 95.1%; OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.67-1.05), and length of stay in neonatal care (median, 6 days in both groups; difference, 0 days; 95% CI, -2 to 7 days) did not differ significantly between the groups. Twenty-one infants (0.90%) of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the neonatal period; 12 did not have neonatal morbidity, 9 had diagnoses with unclear relation to SARS-CoV-2, and none had congenital pneumonia. Conclusions and Relevance: In a nationwide cohort of infants in Sweden, maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy was significantly associated with small increases in some neonatal morbidities. Given the small numbers of events for many of the outcomes and the large number of statistical comparisons, the findings should be interpreted as exploratory.","Norman, Mikael; Navér, Lars; Söderling, Jonas; Ahlberg, Mia; Hervius Askling, Helena; Aronsson, Bernice; Byström, Emma; Jonsson, Jerker; Sengpiel, Verena; Ludvigsson, Jonas F; Håkansson, Stellan; Stephansson, Olof",JAMA,547,1

These fields can tap energy and angular momentum from spinning black holes through superradiant instabilities, during which a macroscopic bosonic condensate develops around the black hole. Striking features of this phenomenon include gaps in the spin-mass distribution of astrophysical black holes and a continuous gravitational-wave (GW) signal emitted by the condensate. So far these processes have been studied in great detail for scalar fields and, more recently, for vector fields. Here we take an important step forward in the black hole superradiance program by computing, analytically, the instability timescale, direct GW emission, and stochastic background, in the case of massive tensor (i.e., spin-2) fields. Our analysis is valid for any black hole spin and for small boson masses. The instability of massive spin-2 fields shares some properties with the scalar and vector cases, but its phenomenology is much richer, for example, there exist multiple modes with comparable instability timescales, and the dominant GW signal is hexadecapolar rather than quadrupolar. Electromagnetic and GW observations of spinning black holes in the mass range M&#8712;(1,10^{10}) M_{â} can constrain the mass of a putative spin-2 field in the range 10^{-22}â²m_{b} c^{2}/eVâ²10^{-10} .

We prepared a web-based survey investigating the clinical findings and contact histories among pediatric patients with AIDs. Confirmed COVID-19 cases, patients with contact history and those with symptoms which were highly suggestive of COVID-19 were called via phone or recruited to a video or face to face appointment. Data of AIDs were obtained from their medical records, retrospectively. Laboratory and screening findings were confirmed by our national health registry website. There were 404 patients (217 female) eligible for the enrollment. During pandemic, 375 (93%) were on colchicine treatment and 48 (11.8%) were receiving biologic treatment. Twenty-four out of 404 patients were admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 suspicion. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) was identified through rhinopharyngeal swabs in seven patients, six of whom were only on colchicine treatment. Only one patient with no finding of any severe respiratory complications was hospitalized. All of seven patients recovered completely. Among patients on biologic drugs, neither a symptom nor a positive polymerase chain reaction test for COVID 19 was detected. In conclusion, pediatric patients with AIDs, those receiving biologic treatment and/or colchicine, may not be at increased risk for neither being infected nor the severe disease course.","Haslak, Fatih; Yildiz, Mehmet; Adrovic, Amra; Sahin, Sezgin; Koker, Oya; Aliyeva, Ayten; Barut, Kenan; Kasapcopur, Ozgur",Rheumatol Int,547,24

The cytokine release syndrome was underlined as a culprit for severe outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a crucial role in human immune responses and elevated IL-6 plasma levels have been associated with the exacerbated COVID-19 pathology. Since non-structural protein 10 (NSP10) of SARS-CoV-2 has been implicated in the induction of IL-6, we designed Peptide (P)1, containing sequences corresponding to amino acids 68-96 of NSP10, and examined its effect on cultured human cells. Treatment with P1 strongly increased IL-6 secretion by the lung cancer cell line NCI-H1792 and the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and revealed profound cytotoxic activity on Caco-2 colorectal adenocarcinoma cells. Treatment with P2, harbouring a mutation in the zinc knuckle motif of NSP10, caused no IL-6 induction and no cytotoxicity. Pre-treatment with plant-produced human anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-37b and IL-38 effectively mitigated the induction of IL-6 secretion. Our results suggest a role for the zinc knuckle motif of NSP10 in the onset of increased IL-6 plasma levels of COVID-19 patients and for IL-37b and IL-38 as therapeutics aimed at attenuating the cytokine release syndrome.","Anborgh, Pieter H.; Kolotilin, Igor; Owens, Nisha; Mahboob, Abdulla Azzam",,547,20

The Spider is a 12 cm diameter radial differential mobility analyzer that spans the 10–500 nm size range with 30 s mobility scans. It achieves its compact size by operating at a nominal mobility resolution R=3 (sheath flow = 0.9 L min-1;aerosol flow = 0.3 L min-1) in place of the higher ratio of sheath flow to aerosol flow commonly used. The question addressed here is whether the lower resolution is sufficient to capture key characteristics of ambient aerosol size distributions. The Spider, operated at R=3 with 30 s up- and downscans, was co-located with a TSI 3081 long-column mobility analyzer, operated at R=10 with a 360 s sampling duty cycle. Ambient aerosol data were collected over 26 consecutive days of continuous operation, in Pasadena, CA. Over the 17–500 nm size range, the two instruments exhibit excellent correlation in the total particle number concentrations and geometric mean diameters, with regression slopes of 1.13 and 1.00, respectively. Our results suggest that particle sizing at a lower resolution than typically employed may be sufficient to obtain key properties of ambient size distributions, at least for these two moments of the size distribution. Moreover, it enables better counting statistics, as the wider transfer function for a given aerosol flow rate results in a higher counting rate.","Stavros, Amanatidis​​​​​​​ Huang Yuanlong Pushpawela Buddhi Schulze Benjamin C.; Kenseth, Christopher M.; Ward, Ryan X.; Seinfeld, John H.; Hering, Susanne V.; Flagan, Richard C.",Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,547,21

We evaluated the association between ACEI or ARB use and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection among patients with hypertension. Methods and Results We identified patients with hypertension as of March 1, 2020 (index date) from Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Patients who received ACEIs, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, thiazide diuretics (TD), or no therapy were identified using outpatient pharmacy data covering the index date. Outcome of interest was a positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test for COVID-19 between March 1 and May 6, 2020. Patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were identified within 1 year preindex date. Among 824 650 patients with hypertension, 16 898 (2.0%) were tested for COVID-19. Of those tested, 1794 (10.6%) had a positive result. Overall, exposure to ACEIs or ARBs was not statistically significantly associated with COVID-19 infection after propensity score adjustment (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.90-1.25) for ACEIs versus calcium channel blockers/beta blockers/TD; OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.91-1.31 for ARBs versus calcium channel blockers/beta blockers/TD).

This paper investigates change in patterns of mortality at local authority level in England (2010-11 to 2017-18) and the relation with fiscal austerity measures. METHODS: Data from official local authority administrative records are used to quantify the gap between observed deaths and what was anticipated in the 2010-based subnational population projections. Regression analyses are used to explore the relation between excess deaths, austerity and wider process of population change at local authority level. RESULTS: We estimate 231 707 total excess deaths, the majority of which occurred since 2014-15 (89%) across the majority of local authorities (91%). Austerity is positively associated with excess deaths. For working age adults, there is a clear gradient to the impact of austerity, whereas for older adults, the impact is more uniform. CONCLUSIONS: Fiscal austerity policies contributed to an excess of deaths for older people and widened social inequalities for younger populations. These results call for an end to all austerity measures and require further research into areas with the highest total excess deaths as a priority following the COVID-19 pandemic.","Darlington-Pollock, Frances; Green, Mark A; Simpson, Ludi",J. public health (Oxf),547,1

The present study aims to evaluate whether outpatient and home care services with remote monitoring and consultation could mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental and affective status, perceived well-being, and personal capabilities of outpatients and home care patients with cognitive disorders. METHODS: Prospectively recorded patients in an electronic web registry provided by BlueCompanion Ltd. Up to October 31, 2020, the sample included 90 patients receiving regular care from the Center for Cognitive Disorders and Dementia in Catanzaro Lido, Italy. It was made of 52 ambulatory outpatients and 38 home care patients, mean age 83.3 ± 7.54 years. Participants underwent a multidimensional assessment at baseline (T0) and after 90 days (T1). For each patient, we administered the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for cognitive functions, the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental ADL (IADL) scales for functional capabilities, the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) for comorbidities and their impact on patients' health, the 5-items Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) for mood, and the Euro Quality of Life (EuroQoL) for perceived quality of life. Contacts with both ambulatory and home care patients were managed in person or via telephone, preferably through video calls (WhatsApp or FaceTime). RESULTS: Contacts with patients were kept at T0 through telephone. At T1, visits were made in person for over 95% out of the cases. The ADL, IADL, CIRS, GDS, MMSE, and EuroQoL changed slightly between T0 and T1.

So, to expand the application areas of this theory, it is generalized to any binary relation. Neighborhoods induced from the relations represent a core bridge between rough sets and application since it represents easy tools for dealing with daily-life problems. Accordingly, the first core objective of the current research is to propose a novel neighborhood (so-called an initial-neighborhood) generated from any binary relation. Based on this neighborhood, we suggest a new generalization to Pawlak rough sets and some of their extensions. The proposed approaches satisfy all properties of classical rough sets without adding any extra restrictions and hence we can apply them in any real-life problem. The second aim is to generalize the notion of nano-topology into any binary relation to extend the applications of this concept. Properties of the suggested methods are introduced with many counter-examples. Comparisons between the suggested techniques and the others studies published in the literature are examined. We proved that the proposed techniques are extra precise than the earlier approaches. Finally, the medical application of COVID-19 is provided to illustrate the significance of our approaches in deciding the impact factors for COVID-19 infection. The proposed application is based on a reflexive relation, so Pawlak rough sets and some of its generalizations couldn’t be applied to solve this problem. Accordingly, we have successes in solving this problem using the suggested techniques. Hence, we write an algorithm to be a useful tool that may help the doctor in diagnosing the infection of COVID-19. © 2021 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.","El Sayed, M.; El Safty, M.

Host innate immunity initially recognizes the viral invasion and induces a rapid inflammatory response, and this recognition activates signaling cascades that trigger the release of antiviral mediators. This chapter aims to explore the mechanisms by which newly emerged coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) activates the host immune system. Since SARS-CoV-2 shares similarities with SARS-CoV that caused the epidemic of SARS in 2003, the pathogenesis of both viruses could be at least very similar. For this, this chapter provides a synthesis of literature concerning antiviral immunity in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. It includes the presentation of epitopes linked to SARS-CoV-2 as well as the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to cause proteolytic activation and interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via molecular mimicry. This chapter characterizes various mechanisms that this virus may engage in escaping the host immunity, ended by a discussion of humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.","Akbarpour, Mahzad; Sharifi, Laleh; Safdarian, Amir Reza; Farhangnia, Pooya; Borjkhani, Mahdis; Rezaei, Nima",Adv Exp Med Biol,547,7

Previous multi-omic data have implied that the pathogenesis of WB is associated with the activation of immune system and inflammatory response. However, the intricate mechanisms are not fully understood. This study was therefore conducted to systematically investigate the morphology, expression of cytokines as well as the underlying signaling pathways regulating the inflammatory response in pectoralis major (PM) muscle of WB myopathic broilers. RESULTS: wHistopathological changes, increased plasma creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities, elevated myeloperoxidase activity and overproduction of nitric oxide in muscle indicated the enhancement of muscle damage and inflammation in WB broilers. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expressions of inflammatory cytokines were dysregulated in PM muscle and contents of interleukin (IL)-1ß, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; were increased in serum of WB myopathic broilers, indicating this myopathy was associated with immune disorder and systemic inflammation response. Additionally, toll-like receptor (TLR) levels were upregulated, the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#954;B) signaling pathway was activated and the mRNA expression levels of downstream inflammatory mediators were enhanced in PM muscle of WB myopathy affected birds.

A national survey was carried out to collect information on the spreading and impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in nursing homes, and on how suspected and/or confirmed cases were managed. We carried out a survey between 25 March 2020 and 5 May 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All Italian nursing homes either public or providing services both privately and within the NHS were included in the study. An on-line questionnaire was sent to 3292 nursing homes across all Italian regions. Nursing homes were also contacted by telephone to provide assistance in completing the questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 1356 nursing homes voluntarily participated to the survey, hosting a total of 100,806 residents. Overall, 9154 residents died due to any cause from February 1 to the time when the questionnaire was completed (from March 25 to May 5). Of these, 7.4% had COVID-19 and 33.8% had flu-like symptoms, corresponding to a cumulative incidence of 0.7 and 3.1, respectively. Lack of personnel, difficulty in transferring patients to hospital or other facility, isolating residents with COVID-19, number of beds and geographical area were the main factor positively associated to the presence of COVID-19 in nursing homes.

This shift provided an opportunity to identify limitations in the current healthcare infrastructure and how these may impact the health and well-being of persons with HD. OBJECTIVE: The study objectives were to assess the feasibility of remote healthcare delivery in HD patients, to identify socioeconomic factors which may explain differences in feasibility and to evaluate the impact of safer-at-home orders on HD patient stress levels. METHODS: This observational study of a clinical HD population during the 'safer-at-home' orders asked patients or caregivers about their current access to healthcare resources and patient stress levels. A chart review allowed for an assessment of socioeconomic status and characterization of HD severity. RESULTS: Two-hundred and twelve HD patients were contacted with 156 completing the survey. During safer-at-home orders, the majority of HD patients were able to obtain medications and see a physician; however, 25% of patients would not commit to regular telehealth visits, and less than 50% utilized an online healthcare platform. We found that 37% of participants were divorced/single, 39% had less than a high school diploma, and nearly 20% were uninsured or on low-income health insurance. Patient stress levels correlated with disease burden. CONCLUSION: A significant portion of HD participants were not willing to participate in telehealth services. Potential explanations for these limitations may include socioeconomic barriers and caregiving structure.

PURPOSE: To review what is known about the pandemic's effect on women's mental health, what makes them more predisposed to vulnerabilities and adverse impacts, and strategies for preventing and treating these mental health consequences in the female population during specific stages across the lifespan. METHODS: The authors performed a narrative review in combination with their observations from clinical experience in the field of women's mental health and reproductive psychiatry. Articles on women's mental health and COVID-19 up to May 30, 2020, were searched using the electronic PubMed and PsychInfo databases, as well as publications by major health entities (e.g., World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United Nations) and press releases from prime communication outlets (e.g., National Public Radio). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Women who are pregnant, postpartum, miscarrying, or experiencing intimate partner violence are at especially high risk for developing mental health problems during the pandemic. Proactive outreach to these groups of women and enhancement of social supports could lead to prevention, early detection, and prompt treatment. Social support is a key protective factor.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between blood glucose (BG) levels and in-hospital mortality in non-critically patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a retrospective multi-centre study involving patients hospitalized in Spain. Patients were categorized into three groups according to admission BG levels: <140 mg/dL, 140-180 mg/dL and >180 mg/dL. The primary endpoint was all-cause in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of the 11,312 patients, only 2128 (18.9%) had diabetes and 2289 (20.4%) died during hospitalization. The in-hospital mortality rates were 15.7% (<140 mg/dL), 33.7% (140-180 mg) and 41.1% (>180 mg/dL), p<.001. The cumulative probability of mortality was significantly higher in patients with hyperglycaemia compared to patients with normoglycaemia (log rank, p<.001), independently of pre-existing diabetes. Hyperglycaemia (after adjusting for age, diabetes, hypertension and other confounding factors) was an independent risk factor of mortality (BG >180 mg/dL: HR 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.31-1.73) (BG 140-180 mg/dL; HR 1.48; 95%CI: 1.29-1.70). Hyperglycaemia was also associated with requirement for mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Admission hyperglycaemia is a strong predictor of all-cause mortality in non-critically hospitalized COVID-19 patients regardless of prior history of diabetes. KEY MESSAGE Admission hyperglycaemia is a stronger and independent risk factor for mortality in COVID-19. Screening for hyperglycaemia, in patients without diabetes, and early treatment of hyperglycaemia should be mandatory in the management of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Admission hyperglycaemia should not be overlooked in all patients regardless prior history of diabetes.","Carrasco-Sánchez, Francisco Javier; López-Carmona, Mª Dolores; Martínez-Marcos, Francisco Javier; Pérez-Belmonte, Luis M; Hidalgo-Jiménez, Alicia; Buonaiuto, Verónica; Suárez Fernández, Carmen; Freire Castro, Santiago Jesús; Luordo, Davide; Pesqueira Fontan, Paula Maria; Blázquez Encinar, Julio César; Magallanes Gamboa, Jeffrey Oskar; de la Peña Fernández, Andrés; Torres Peña, José David; Fernández Solà, Joaquim; Napal Lecumberri, Jose Javier; Amorós Martínez, Francisco; Guisado Espartero, María Esther; Jorge Ripper, Carlos; Gómez Méndez, Raquel; Vicente López, Natalia; Román Bernal, Berta; Rojano Rivero, María Gloria; Ramos Rincón, José Manuel; Gómez Huelgas, Ricardo",Ann Med,547,16

PURPOSE: To investigate the experiences of undergraduate nursing students during their first uses of OL to increase the understanding of their encountered opportunities and challenges. DESIGN: A descriptive qualitative design guided by a phenomenological approach was used. METHODS: The study used a purposive sampling technique to recruit 18 undergraduate nursing students from two universities. Data were collected using two focus group discussions, and the discussions with participants were audio/video recorded through the online platform Zoom due to the national imposed curfew. Content analysis employed Colaizzi's steps to derive the themes/categories. RESULTS: The study revealed four themes: experience of helplessness, burdens, and burnout; the need for social and technical support to manage OL; the propensity to consider OL as a positive opportunity; and the deficiency of OL in fulfilling the educational outcomes of clinical courses. CONCLUSIONS: Abrupt remote OL was a challenge to clinical encounters. This format was very stressful; however, it was also useful. The current study highlighted the need for further research on the effectiveness of remote OL platforms in regard to the achievement of the intended learning outcomes of clinical courses.","Suliman, Wafika A; Abu-Moghli, Fathieh A; Khalaf, Inaam; Zumot, Arwa F; Nabolsi, Manar",Nurse Educ Today,547,16

Dietary patterns are different based on cultural, environmental, technological, and economic factors. Nutritional deficiencies of energy, protein, and specific micronutrients have been shown to contribute to depressed immune function and increased susceptibility to infections. We aimed to explore the relation of dietary factors with global infection and mortality rates of COVID-19 in this study. DESIGN: In the current ecological study, the countries that had national dietary data from the Global Dietary Databases of the United Nations and Coronavirus disease statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) were included. The countries that had Coronavirus disease statistics from the WHO were consecutively checked for the recent data of the dietary factors. SETTING: World. PARTICIPANTS: 158 countries across the world. MEASUREMENTS: infection and mortality rates of COVID-19;dietary factors. RESULTS: The median crude infection and mortality rates by COVID-19 were 87.78 (IQR: 468.03) and 0.0015 (IQR: 0.0059), respectively. The two highest percentage of the crude infection rate were between 0 and 500 (75.9%) and 500–1000 (8.9%) per one million persons. The regression analysis showed that the crude infection rate has been increased by raising consuming fruits (Beta: 0.237;P=0.006) and calcium (Beta: 0.286;P=0.007) and was decreased with rising consuming beans and legumes (Beta: −0.145;P=0.038). The analysis showed that the crude mortality rate was increased by raising consuming sugar-sweetened beverages (Beta: 0.340;P&lt;0.001). Whereas, the crude mortality rate by COVID-19 has been decreased by increasing fruits consuming (Beta: −0.226;P=0.047) and beans and legumes (Beta: −0.176;P=0.046). CONCLUSION: The present study showed the higher intake of fruits and sugar-sweetened beverages had a positive effect on infection and mortally rates by COVID-19, respectively. In contrast, the higher intake of beans and legumes had a negative effect on both increasing infection and mortality rates.","Abdulah, Deldar Morad Hassan A.

Antibodies against S protein receptor binding domain (RBD) have been shown to confer a neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Assays quantitatively measuring anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be of great value for NAb screening of potential donors for convalescent-phase plasma therapy, assessing natural or vaccine-induced immunity, stratifying individuals for vaccine receipt, and documenting vaccine response. METHODS: Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S), a high-throughput automated electrochemiluminescence double-antigen sandwich immunoassay for quantitative measurement of pan-anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, was evaluated against NT on 357 patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. NT was performed in a BSL-3 laboratory using a Slovenian SARS-CoV-2 isolate; the NT titer &#8805;1:20 was considered positive. RESULTS: Elecsys-S detected pan-anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 352/357 (98.6 %) samples. NAb were identified by NT in 257/357 (72 %) samples. The Elecsys-S/NT agreement was moderate (Cohen's kappa 0.56). High NT titer antibodies (&#8805;1:160) were detected in 106/357 (30 %) samples. Elecsys-S's pan-anti-S1-RBD-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations correlated with individual NT titer categories (the lowest concentrations were identified in NT-negative samples and the highest in samples with NT titer 1:1,280), and the Elecsys-S cutoff value for reasonable prediction of NAb generated after natural infection was established (133 BAU/mL). CONCLUSION: Although NT should remain the gold standard for assessing candidates for convalescent-phase plasma donors, selected commercial anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays with optimized cutoff, like Elecsys-S, could be used for rapid, automated, and large-scale screening of individuals with clinically relevant NAb levels as suitable donors.","Resman Rus, Katarina; Korva, Misa; Knap, Natasa; Avsic Zupanc, Tatjana; Poljak, Mario",J Clin Virol,547,16

In addition, prolonged hospital stay, invasive therapeutic devices, widespread use of empiric antibiotics and most importantly use of immune-suppressants like Steroid or Tocilizumab further increases the chances of bacterial infection. As opposed to this concept-physical distancing, frequent hand washing and use of gloves and protective gear by the healthcare workers also diminishes the chance of secondary bacterial infection. The present study is done to delineate the bacteriological profile, infection site predisposition or to gain knowledge on antibiotic sensitivity pattern. MethodRetrospective data will be analyzed from June 2020, when the first COVID wave came to June 2021, corresponding to second COVID wave. The present study is a pilot study before collecting and analyzing the whole data Only those samples which were positive for bacterial isolates were randomly selected and the COVID status and drug resistance patterns were checked. Results and discussionThe most common organism found was Klebsiella. Acinetobacter was also found in few patients. But most striking finding was that COVID positive patients showed higher incidence of antibiotic resistance with Acinetobacter. Though E Coli was also found commonly in COVID positive patients, they were not drug resistant. ConclusionMDR infections are common in COVID patients. Acinetobacter and Klebsiella are prone to develope MDR infections. While E.Coli is also common in COVID patients, chance of drug resistance is less among them.","Haldar, Arup Kumar; Mukherjee, Deep Narayan; Seal, Soumyadeep; Dasgupta, Hindol; Chakraborty, Mainak",,547,2

It describes regional variations and COVID-19 infection rate in patients undergoing foot and ankle surgery before, during and after the first national lock-down. PATIENTS & METHODS: This was a multicentre, retrospective, UK-based, national audit on foot and ankle patients who underwent surgery between 13th January and 31st July 2020. Data was examined pre- UK national lockdown, during lockdown (23rd March to 11th May 2020) and post-lockdown. All adult patients undergoing foot and ankle surgery in an operating theatre during the study period included from 43 participating centres in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Regional, demographic and COVID-19 related data were captured. RESULTS: 6644 patients were included. In total 0.53% of operated patients contracted COVID-19 (n = 35). The rate of COVID-19 infection was highest during lockdown (2.11%, n = 16) and lowest after lockdown (0.16%, n = 3). Overall mean activity during lockdown was 24.44% of pre-lockdown activity with decreases in trauma, diabetic and elective foot and ankle surgery; the change in elective surgery was most marked with only 1.73% activity during lock down and 10.72% activity post lockdown as compared to pre-lockdown. There was marked regional variation in numbers of cases performed, but the proportion of decrease in cases during and after lockdown was comparable between all regions. There was also a significant difference between rates of COVID-19 and timing of peak, cumulative COVID-19 infections between regions with the highest rate noted in South East England (3.21%). The overall national peak infection rate was 1.37%, occurring during the final week of lockdown. General anaesthetic remained the most common method of anaesthesia for foot and ankle surgery, although a significant increase in regional anaesthesia was witnessed in the lock-down and post-lockdown periods. CONCLUSIONS: National surgical activity reduced significantly for all cases across the country during lockdown with only a slow subsequent increase in elective activity. The COVID-19 infection rate and peaks differed significantly across the country.","Mason, Lyndon W; Malhotra, Karan; Houchen-Wollof, Linzy; Mangwani, Jitendra",Foot ankle surg,547,24

Immune mapped protein-1 (IMP1) is a novel membrane protein, and was reported to be a candidate protective antigen. However, production and utilization modes of IMP1 using Lactococcus lactis as delivery vector were not reported untill now. In the present study, Eimeria tenella IMP1 (EtIMP1) protein was expressed in L. lactis under the nisin-inducible promoter, and EtIMP1 protein was produced in cytoplasmic, cell wall-anchored and secreted forms. Each chicken was orally immunized with one of the three live EtIMP1-expressing lactococci three times at 2 weeks intervals (immunized group), or with live bacteria harboring empty vector (immunized control group). Chickens in immunized and immunized control group were challenged with E. tenella sporulated oocysts to assess the immune responses. The results showed that proliferative responses of peripheral blood T lymphocytes, mRNA expression levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-Î³ in spleen tissues, levels of serum IgG and secretory IgA (sIgA) in cecal lavage fluids from chickens in immunized group were all significantly elevated compared to that in immunized control group. All three the live EtIMP1-expressing lactococci significantly decreased oocyst shedding, alleviated pathological damage in cecum and improved weight gain compared with bacteria harboring empty vector. These results suggested EtIMP1 protein delivered by L. lactis might be a promising candidate in developing novel vaccines against Eimeria infection.","Ma, Chunli; Li, Guanghao; Chen, Wenjing; Jia, Zhipeng; Yang, Xuelian; Pan, Xinghui; Ma, Dexing",Vet Parasitol,547,10

Fluids 32, 061704 (2020)] showed that the drying time of typical respiratory droplets is on the order of seconds, while the survival time of the coronavirus on different surfaces was reported to be on the order of hours in recent experiments. We attribute the long survival time of the coronavirus on a surface to the slow evaporation of a thin nanometer liquid film remaining after the evaporation of the bulk droplet. Accordingly, we employ a computational model for a thin film in which the evaporating mass rate is a function of disjoining and Laplace pressures inside the film. The model shows a strong dependence on the initial thickness of the film and suggests that the drying time of this nanometric film is on the order of hours, consistent with the survival time of the coronavirus on a surface, seen in published experiments. We briefly examine the change in the drying time as a function of the contact angle and type of surface. The computed time-varying film thickness or volume qualitatively agrees with the measured decay of the coronavirus titer on different surfaces. The present work provides insights on why coronavirus survival is on the order of hours or days on a solid surface under ambient conditions.","Bhardwaj, Rajneesh; Agrawal, Amit",Phys Fluids (1994),547,15

Media accounts of quinine's antiviral effect in vitro, as well as press reports about quinine-based compounds, such as hydroxychloroquine, have sparked renewed public interest in drinking tonic water, which could perhaps result in an increase in allergic phenomena. On the 200th anniversary of the discovery of quinine, our main objective was to analyze hypersensitivity reactions, related to the consumption of beverages containing quinine, described in the literature. Patients and methods: We analyzed case reports indexed on Pubmed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. A quinine causality score was calculated for each of the observations. A quinine assay was performed on several beverages for which the quinine content had not been published. Results: In parallel with related pharmacokinetic studies, these case reports consist of 26 observations. The case reports mainly related to young men, with symptoms of varying severity, mainly dermatological, with fixed drug eruption, generalized rashes, hives; hematological, with thrombocytopenia, hemorrhagic syndrome, thrombotic microangiopathy; more rarely ocular, cardiac or auditory. The level of causality of quinine is certain for three cases, probable for twenty-two, possible for two. The levels of quinine, all conforming to the standards, were lower in the spirits and the cooked wine than those of tonic water. Discussion: Possibly under-diagnosed, the main mechanism of these reactions is immuno-allergic, without any cross-reaction with other quinolines having been shown. In these patients and breastfeeding women of G6PD deficient newborns, any medicines, phytotherapy, homeopathy, or even cosmetics containing quinine, on the basis of a proposed list, should be avoided.","Lefrère, B; Barbaud, A; Bagot, M; Bourgogne, E",,547,16

Results show that, on one hand, Morocco has experienced an improvement in air quality by a significant reduction in NO2 and a relative reduction in PM2,5. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the particulate pollution in Morocco is partly due to synoptic weather patterns, and that a significant part of NO2 emissions is incoming mainly from the outside northern borders of Morocco.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to investigate internet search behaviors related to COVID-19 and examine the circulation of infodemic monikers through two platforms-Google and Instagram-during the current global pandemic. METHODS: We have defined infodemic moniker as a term, query, hashtag, or phrase that generates or feeds fake news, misinterpretations, or discriminatory phenomena. Using Google Trends and Instagram hashtags, we explored internet search activities and behaviors related to the COVID-19 pandemic from February 20, 2020, to May 6, 2020. We investigated the names used to identify the virus, health and risk perception, life during the lockdown, and information related to the adoption of COVID-19 infodemic monikers. We computed the average peak volume with a 95% CI for the monikers. RESULTS: The top six COVID-19-related terms searched in Google were ""coronavirus,"" ""corona,"" ""COVID,"" ""virus,"" ""corona virus,"" and ""COVID-19."" Countries with a higher number of COVID-19 cases had a higher number of COVID-19 queries on Google. The monikers ""coronavirus ozone,"" ""coronavirus laboratory,"" ""coronavirus 5G,"" ""coronavirus conspiracy,"" and ""coronavirus bill gates"" were widely circulated on the internet. Searches on ""tips and cures"" for COVID-19 spiked in relation to the US president speculating about a ""miracle cure"" and suggesting an injection of disinfectant to treat the virus. Around two thirds (n=48,700,000, 66.1%) of Instagram users used the hashtags ""COVID-19"" and ""coronavirus"" to disperse virus-related information. CONCLUSIONS: Globally, there is a growing interest in COVID-19, and numerous infodemic monikers continue to circulate on the internet. Based on our findings, we hope to encourage mass media regulators and health organizers to be vigilant and diminish the use and circulation of these infodemic monikers to decrease the spread of misinformation.","Rovetta, Alessandro; Bhagavathula, Akshaya Srikanth",J Med Internet Res,547,29

Italy is one of the most affected countries by COVID-19, particularly in the northern regions. Several studies consider COVID-19 a zoonotic disease and, since Italy is the repository of a high biodiversity, SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals can be considered as a reservoir of the virus or favor the spreading between animals and humans. In this work, we analyzed the amino acid sequences of ACE2 protein of the most common domestic and wild animals present in Italy. Among the latter, we focused on ACE2 of the Chiroptera species present in Italy, to identify the primary reservoir in this region. First, we reproduced in silico the Chiroptera ACE2/viral Spike (S) protein interactions on the human ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 S complex model and identified the critical residues for the binding. In silico molecular docking of ACE2 belonging to Chiroptera vs. SARS-CoV-2 S protein pointed to Rhinolophus ferrumequinum as a bat living in Italy, that may be a potential primary reservoir of the virus. On the other hand, a sequence similarity search on ACE2 of domestic and wild animals living in Italy pointed to domestic (horses, cats, cattle and sheep) and wild (European rabbits and grizzly bears) animal species as potential SARS-CoV-2 secondary reservoirs. Molecular docking of ACE2 belonging to these species vs. S protein of Bat coronavirus (Bt-CoV/Rp3/2004) suggests that the primary reservoir Rhinolophus ferrumequinum may infect the secondary reservoirs, domestic and worldwide animals living in Italy, determining a specific risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Buonocore, Michela; Marino, Carmen; Grimaldi, Manuela; Santoro, Angelo; Firoznezhad, Mohammad; Paciello, Orlando; Prisco, Francesco; D039,; Ursi, Anna Maria",Heliyon,547,16

Spike glycoprotein engages host Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors for entry into host cells, where the receptor recognition and attachment of spike glycoprotein to the ACE2 receptors is a prerequisite step and key determinant of the host cell and tissue tropism. Binding of spike glycoprotein to the ACE2 receptor triggers a cascade of structural transitions, including transition from a metastable pre-fusion to a post-fusion form, thereby allowing membrane fusion and internalization of the virus. From ancient times people have relied on naturally occurring substances like phytochemicals to fight against diseases and infection. Among these phytochemicals, flavonoids and non-flavonoids have been the active sources of different anti-microbial agents. We performed molecular docking studies using 10 potential naturally occurring compounds (flavonoids/non-flavonoids) against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and compared their affinity with an FDA approved repurposed drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). Further, our molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and energy landscape studies with fisetin, quercetin, and kamferol revealed that these molecules bind with the hACE2-S complex with low binding free energy. The study provided an indication that these molecules might have the potential to perturb the binding of hACE2-S complex. In addition, ADME analysis also suggested that these molecules consist of drug-likeness property, which may be further explored as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Our model postulates a general contact rate that represents a local measure of several factors: the population size of infected hosts that arrive at a given location as a function of total population size, the current incidence at neighboring locations, and the connectivity of the network where the disease spreads. This parameter can be interpreted as an indicator of outbreak risk at a given location. This parameter is tied to the fraction of individuals that move across boundaries (migration).

Viruses contribute to 30-70% of acute respiratory infections. Identification of these respiratory viruses is not given high priority except influenza; however, the knowledge about prevalence of non-influenza viruses, their seasonal pattern and genetic evolution have significant epidemiological value. Methods: As a part of National Influenza-like illness surveillance programme, respiratory specimens were collected children and adults with symptoms of ILI or ARI, between January 2012 and March 2015 (including SARI cases). Real-time PCR was done to identify 13 respiratory viruses. Sequencing was done for representative isolates of each virus using ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer. Results: During the study period between January 2012 and March 2015, a total of 648 patients with symptoms of ARI were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 20.2 years (SDâ¯=â¯19.13, medianâ¯=â¯18); 292 (45.1%) were children (&#8804;13 years) and 356 (54.9%) were adults. Respiratory viruses were identified in 44% (287/648) of all patients. Influenza accounted for the maximum number of cases- 179/648 (27.6%). Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated with 34 cases (5.2%), followed by HMPV 24 (3.7%) and PIV-3 20 (3%). Four patients died due to INF A/H1N1 as a result of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (CFR 3.7%). Among the non-influenza viruses, no particular seasonality pattern was observed over the different months of the study period. Conclusion: Antibiotic usage in treating acute respiratory infections empirically is not justified as nearly half of ARI are due to viruses; nearly 28% of them were due to influenza viruses. Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated, followed by HMPV. This study is based on an active influenza surveillance initiated after 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak, in the Union territory of Puducherry which has contributed significantly to the knowledge of the burden of influenza and non-influenza viruses among children and adults. Such surveillance network has paved the way for better diagnosis and timely therapeutic interventions.","Palani, Nandhini; Sistla, Sujatha",,547,23

Although previous studies have generally used genetically verified pedigrees to document effects of inbreeding and gene flow, these often fail to capture the whole inbreeding history of the species. By assembling a draft arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) genome and re-sequencing complete genomes of 23 additional foxes born before and after a well-documented immigration event in Scandinavia, we here look into the genomic consequences of inbreeding and genetic rescue. We found a difference in genome-wide diversity, with 18% higher heterozygosity and 81% lower FROH in immigrant F1 compared to native individuals. However, more distant descendants of immigrants (F2, F3) did not show the same pattern. We also found that foxes with lower inbreeding had higher probability to survive their first year of life. Our results demonstrate the important link between genetic variation and fitness as well as the transient nature of genetic rescue. Moreover, our results have implications in conservation biology as they demonstrate that inbreeding depression can effectively be detected in the wild by a genomic approach.","Hasselgren, Malin; Dussex, Nicolas; von Seth, Johanna; Angerbjörn, Anders; Olsen, Remi-André; Dalén, Love; Norén, Karin",Mol. ecol,547,24

COVID-19 transmission is faster than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pneumonia outbreak in 2002. This is mainly attributed to the different pathways of virus-infected host cells, coupled with patients' atypical clinical characteristics. SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact, infecting lung tissues before damaging other body organs, such as the liver, brain, kidney and heart. The present study identified potential target genes for SARS-COV-2 receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, in normal human lung tissue.

Delivered at times that are usually considered outside of core teaching hours (evening classes and weekend workshops), blended-learning programmes have often been delivered by part-time staff or research students rather than being embraced by the permanent lecturers.With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, several programmes were redesigned to adopt a blend of online and on-campus teaching. While not officially defined as blended-learning programmes, this mode of learning has been incorporated across the teaching spectrum by lecturers who, in some cases, have little to no knowledge or experience of it. This has brought several challenges not only to teachers, but also to students who very often may not be as tech-savvy as they claim to be.These challenges notwithstanding, it is important to consider this online migration, not as a stopgap process, engendered out of necessity, but rather as an importunity to embrace certain approaches that may have previously seemed daunting. The advantages of blended or online learning that teachers have been using this academic year must not be abandoned when no longer needed, but rather incorporated into teaching programmes as integral components of a more holistic learning experience.This article provides a brief overview of how some more mainstream programmes adapted their content to cater to a new learning environment. The blended-learning tools and functionalities incorporated into this teaching will be examined, firstly in how they formed an integral part of blended-learning modules and how they have been adjusted to target a fulltime student audience. Finally, and perhaps most crucially, as we move to a post-Covid environment, suggestions are made regarding how certain aspects of blended learning can be retained when returning to a ‘normal’ classroom.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is necessary to adequately evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of the asthma population in the COVID-19 tested and diagnosed population. OBJECTIVE: We performed a study to assess the impact of asthma on COVID-19 diagnosis, presenting symptoms, disease severity, and cytokine profiles. METHODS: This was an analysis of a prospectively collected cohort of patients suspected of having COVID-19 who presented for COVID-19 testing at a tertiary medical center in Missouri, USA between March and September 2020. We classified and analyzed patients according to their preexisting asthma diagnosis and subsequent COVID-19 testing results. RESULTS: COVID-19 suspected patients (n=435) were enrolled in this study. The proportion of patients testing positive for COVID-19 was 69.2% and 81.9% in the asthma and non-asthma groups respectively. The frequency of relevant symptoms are similar between asthma groups with positive and negative COVID-19 test results. In the COVID-19 diagnosed population (n=343), asthma was not associated with several indicators of COVID-19 severity, including hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, death due to COVID-19, and in-hospital mortality after multivariate adjustment. COVID-19 patients with asthma exhibited significantly lower levels of plasma interleukin (IL)-8 compared to patients without asthma (adjusted p=0.023). CONCLUSION: The asthma population is facing a challenge in preliminary COVID-19 evaluation due to overlap in symptoms of COVID-19 and asthma. However, asthma does not increase the risk of COVID-19 severity if infected.","Cao, Lijuan; Lee, Sandra; Krings, James G; Rauseo, Adriana M; Reynolds, Daniel; Presti, Rachel; Goss, Charles; Mudd, Philip A; O039,; Halloran, Jane A; Wang, Leyao",Ann. allergy asthma immunol,547,30

In several application areas such as biology, genomics and proteomics, the data are often functional in their nature and exhibit a degree of roughness and non-stationarity. These structures pose additional challenges to commonly used methods that rely mainly on a two-stage approach performing variable selection and classification separately. We propose in this work a novel Gaussian process discriminant analysis (GPDA) that combines these steps in a unified framework. Our model is a two-layer non-stationary Gaussian process coupled with an Ising prior to identify differentially-distributed locations. Scalable inference is achieved via developing a variational scheme that exploits advances in the use of sparse inverse covariance matrices. We demonstrate the performance of our methodology on simulated datasets and two proteomics datasets: breast cancer and SARS-CoV-2. Our approach distinguishes itself by offering explainability as well as uncertainty quantification in addition to low computational cost, which are crucial to increase trust and social acceptance of data-driven tools.","Yu, W; Wade, S; Bondell, H D; Azizi, L",,547,23

Seafarers may bear an excess pressure during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors associated with depression symptoms among Chinese seafarers during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: This field survey-based study was conducted at Rongcheng Port, Shandong Province, China, from 10 June 2020 to 25 July 2020. Sociodemographic and occupational characteristics and health-related behaviours were collected through a face-to-face questionnaire. The Self-Rating Depression Scale was used to evaluate depression status during the preceding week. Logistic regression models were used to explore factors related to depression. RESULTS: 441 male Chinese seafarers were enrolled. Overall, the proportions of seafarers with low, moderate and severe depression symptoms were 23.35%, 9.30% and 9.07%, respectively. Compared with those with good self-rated health (SRH), seafarers with poor SRH had higher odds of depression (OR, 2.24, 95% CI 1.22 to 4.11). Less leisure time or physical exercise was associated with more severe self-reported depression symptoms (1-3 per week vs &#8805;4 per week: OR, 1.72, 95% CI 0.71 to 4.14; none vs &#8805;4 per week: OR, 3.93, 95% CI 1.67 to 9.26). Poor sleep quality was associated with higher likelihood of reporting severe depression (fair vs good: OR, 2.78, 95% CI 1.54 to 5.01; poor vs good: OR, 4.30, 95% CI 1.65 to 11.24). The more frequent seafarers worked overtime a week, the higher the likelihood of reporting severe depression symptoms (1-2 per week vs none: OR, 1.82, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.18; &#8805;3 per week vs none: OR, 2.49, 95% CI 1.05 to 5.92). Also, high perceived work stress was linked to higher odds of being depressed (intermediate vs low: OR, 2.06, 95% CI 0.78 to 5.46; high vs low: OR, 3.83, 95% CI 1.35 to 10.90). CONCLUSIONS: There is a high burden of depression associated with COVID-19 among seafarers.

Specifically, when these events occur during critical periods of brain plasticity, a time of significant synaptogenesis, neural pruning, and myelination, typical neurodevelopment can become derailed. Adverse childhood experiences promote morphological changes in neuronal microcircuitry which may lead to diminished cognitive flexibility, inattention, increased impulsivity, decreased school readiness, and disruptive behaviors. In this regard, the current COVID-19 pandemic represents an especially complex adverse experience that disturbs a child's social milieu and support network, likely interfering with brain maturation and executive function. Here, we take a neurodevelopmental approach to argue for the critical role that pediatricians must fulfill in mitigating the potentially detrimental consequences of COVID-19. We call for ACE screening and anticipatory guidance in the primary care setting, and the use of validated interventions and skills to bolster resilience, when ACEs are identified. We present a clinical workflow for the physician to proactively assess, identify, stratify, and address the severity of ACEs worsened by COVID-19. We discuss home-based activities and resources for children and adolescents to promote stress reduction, connectiveness, and self-awareness and create a more positive environment to maximize neurodevelopmental potential in the face of the ongoing pandemic.","Berken, J.

The identification of potential symptoms has been reported to be a useful tool for clinical decision-making in emergency departments to avoid overload and improve the quality of care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances of symptoms as a diagnostic tool for SARS -CoV-2 infection. METHODS: An observational, cross-sectional, prospective and analytical study was carried out, during the period of time from April 14 to July 21, 2020. Data (demographic variables, medical history, respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms) were collected by emergency physicians. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was made using SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. The diagnostic accuracy of these characteristics for COVID-19 was evaluated by calculating the positive and negative likelihood ratios. A Mantel-Haenszel and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association of symptoms with COVID-19. RESULTS: A prevalence of 53.72% of SARS-CoV-2 infection was observed. The symptom with the highest sensitivity was cough 71%, and a specificity of 52.68%. The symptomatological scale, constructed from 6 symptoms, obtained a sensitivity of 83.45% and a specificity of 32.86%, taking &#8805;2 symptoms as a cut-off point. The symptoms with the greatest association with SARS-CoV-2 were: anosmia odds ratio (OR) 3.2 (95% CI; 2.52-4.17), fever OR 2.98 (95% CI; 2.47-3.58), dyspnea OR 2.9 (95% CI; 2.39-3.51]) and cough OR 2.73 (95% CI: 2.27-3.28). CONCLUSION: The combination of &#8805;2 symptoms / signs (fever, cough, anosmia, dyspnea and oxygen saturation < 93%, and headache) results in a highly sensitivity model for a quick and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, and should be used in the absence of ancillary diagnostic studies. Symptomatology, alone and in combination, may be an appropriate strategy to use in the emergency department to guide the behaviors to respond to the disease.

The aim of the investigation is to evaluate the benefits of 20-30 minutes in contact with nature. BACKGROUND: The Scientific Community, also through the evidence-based design approach, has already demonstrated the importance of greenery and nature on the psychophysical well-being of people and, in a moment of emergency, contact with the nature can be therapeutic and quite influential on the mental health of staff subject to stress. METHOD: During the lockdown, an Italian multidisciplinary working group promoted an experience-based survey, based on the Profile of Mood States methodology, for measuring the psychophysical well-being of hospital staff. RESULTS: The author collected 77 questionnaires. The benefits that users have obtained from the experience in nature have been investigated by comparing the type of stresses they were subjected to and highlighting various peculiarities in the data analysis associated with the type of green in which they carried out the survey, the healthcare areas in which they worked during the pandemic emergency, and the moment in which the survey was conducted.

In general, older patients often have atypical symptom presentations during acute illness due to a high level of comorbidity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the presentation of symptoms at hospital admissions in older patients with COVID-19 and evaluate its impact on disease outcome. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients &#8805;80 years of age with a positive test for SARS-CoV-2, who were admitted to one of three medical departments in Denmark from March 1st to June 1st, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 102 patients (47% male) with a mean age of 85 years were included. The most common symptoms at admission were fever (74%), cough (62%), and shortness of breath (54%). Furthermore, atypical symptoms like confusion (29%), difficulty walking (13%), and falls (8%) were also present. In-hospital and 30-day mortality were 31% (n = 32) and 41% (n = 42), respectively. Mortality was highest in patients with confusion (50% vs 38%) or falls (63% vs 39%), and nursing home residency prior to hospital admission was associated with higher mortality (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1-6.7). CONCLUSIONS: Older patients with SARS-Cov-2 displayed classical symptoms of COVID-19 but also geriatric frailty symptoms such as confusion and walking impairments. Additionally, both in-hospital and 30-day mortality was very high. Our study highlights the need for preventive efforts to keep older people from getting COVID-19 and increased awareness of frailty among those with COVID-19.","Karlsson, Linda Katharina; Jakobsen, Lasse Hjort; Hollensberg, Louise; Ryg, Jesper; Midttun, Mette; Frederiksen, Henrik; Glenthøj, Andreas; Kodahl, Anette Raskov; Secher-Johnsen, Joanna; Nielsen, Lene Kongsgaard; Bofill, Nuria Gonzalez; Knudtzen, Fredrikke Christie; Lund, Cecilia Margareta",Arch Gerontol Geriatr,547,1

Here we report on the use of purified ß-glucan (lentinan) extracts from Lentinus edodes (Shiitake) mushroom that can reduce infection by a multidrug-resistant clinical isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae in a rodent pneumonia model, likely through immunomodulation. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to intra-tracheal administration of K. pneumoniae to induce pulmonary sepsis and randomized to three groups; vehicle control (Vehicle, n = 12), commercial lentinan (CL, n = 8) or in-house extracted lentinan (IHL, n = 8) were administered intravenously 1 h postinfection. Physiological parameters and blood gas analysis were measured, bacterial counts from bronchoalveolar-lavage (BAL) were determined, along with differential staining of white cells and measurement of protein concentration in BAL 48 h after pneumonia induction. Use of IHL extract significantly decreased BAL CFU counts. Both CL and IHL extractions reduced protein concentration in BAL. Use of IHL resulted in an improvement in physiological parameters compared to controls and CL. In conclusion, administration of lentinan to treat sepsis-induced lung injury appears safe and effective and may exert its effects in an immunomodulatory manner.","Masterson, C H; Murphy, E J; Gonzalez, H; Major, I; McCarthy, S D; O039,; Toole, D; Laffey, J G; Rowan, N J",Lett Appl Microbiol,547,16

The analysis is based on a metapopulation epidemic model structured by risk. We perform a global sensitivity analysis using the Sobol method. Our analysis suggest that the reduction of mobility among patches plays a significant role in the mitigation of the disease close to the effect of immunization coverage of 30% achieved in four months. Moreover, for an immunization coverage between 20% and 50% achieved in the first half of 2021 with a vaccine efficacy between 70% and 95%, the percentage reduction in the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections is between 30% and 50% by the end of 2021 in comparison with the no vaccination scenario.","Saldana, F.; Velasco-Hernandez, J.

The goal of this study was to quantify changes in medical care during the first wave of the pandemic using radiological examinations as a comprehensive surrogate marker and to determine potential future workload. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all radiological examinations during the first wave of the pandemic was performed. The number of examinations was compared to time-matched control periods. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of radiological examinations attributed to various medical specialties was conducted and postponed examinations were extrapolated to calculate additional workload in the near future. RESULTS: A total of 596,760 examinations were analyzed. Overall case volumes decreased by an average of 41â% during the shutdown compared to the control period. The most affected radiological modalities were sonography (-54â%), X-ray (-47â%) followed by MRI (-42â%). The most affected medical specialty was trauma and orthopedics (-60â% case volume) followed by general surgery (-49â%). Examination numbers increased during the post-shutdown period leading to a predicted additional workload of up to 22â%. CONCLUSION: This study shows a marked decrease in radiological examinations in total and among several core medical specialties, indicating a significant reduction in medical care during the first COVID-19 shutdown. KEY POINTS: · Number of radiological examinations decreased by 41â% during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.. · Several core medical specialties were heavily affected with a reduction of case volumes up to 60â%.. · When extrapolating postponed examinations to the near future, the overall workload for radiological departments might increase up to 22â%..

SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is typically minimally symptomatic. We report a series of febrile pediatric patients with acute heart failure potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control. Methods: Over a two-month period contemporary with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France and Switzerland, we retrospectively collected clinical, biological, therapeutic, and early outcomes data in children who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in 14 centers for cardiogenic shock, left ventricular dysfunction and severe inflammatory state. Results: Thirty-five children were identified and included in the study. Median age at admission was 10 years (range 2-16 years). Co-morbidities were present in 28% including asthma and overweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms were prominent. Left ventricular ejection fraction was <30% in one third; 80% required inotropic support with 28% treated with ECMO. Inflammation markers were suggestive of cytokine storm (interleukin 6 median 135 pg/mL) and macrophage activation (D-dimer median 5284 ng/mL). Mean brain natriuretic peptide was elevated (5743 pg/mL). Thirty-one/35 (88%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR of nasopharyngeal swab or serology. All patients received intravenous immune globulin, with adjunctive steroid therapy used in one third. Left ventricular function was restored in the 25/35 of those discharged from the intensive care unit. No patient died, and all patients treated with ECMO were successfully weaned. Conclusion: Children may experience an acute cardiac decompensation due to severe inflammatory state following SARS-CoV-2 infection (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children - MIS-C). Treatment with immune globulin appears to be associated with recovery of left ventricular systolic function.","Belhadjer, Zahra; Méot, Mathilde; Bajolle, Fanny; Khraiche, Diala; Legendre, Antoine; Abakka, Samya; Auriau, Johanne; Grimaud, Marion; Oualha, Mehdi; Beghetti, Maurice; Wacker, Julie; Ovaert, Caroline; Hascoet, Sebastien; Selegny, Maëlle; Malekzadeh-Milani, Sophie; Maltret, Alice; Bosser, Gilles; Giroux, Nathan; Bonnemains, Laurent; Bordet, Jeanne; Di Filippo, Sylvie; Mauran, Pierre; Falcon-Eicher, Sylvie; Thambo, Jean-Benoît; Lefort, Bruno; Moceri, Pamela; Houyel, Lucile; Renolleau, Sylvain; Bonnet, Damien",Circulation,547,24

We isolated neutrophils from the blood of COVID‐19 patients receiving general ward care and from patients hospitalised at intensive care units (ICUs) to explore the kinetics of circulating neutrophils and factors important for neutrophil migration and activation.MethodsMulticolour flow cytometry was exploited for the analysis of neutrophil differentiation and activation markers. Multiplex and ELISA technologies were used for the quantification of protease, protease inhibitor, chemokine and cytokine concentrations in plasma. Neutrophil polarisation responses were evaluated microscopically. Gelatinolytic and metalloproteinase activity in plasma was determined using a fluorogenic substrate. Co‐culturing healthy donor neutrophils with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) allowed us to investigate viral replication in neutrophils.ResultsUpon ICU admission, patients displayed high plasma concentrations of granulocyte–colony‐stimulating factor (G‐CSF) and the chemokine CXCL8, accompanied by emergency myelopoiesis as illustrated by high levels of circulating CD10−, immature neutrophils with reduced CXCR2 and C5aR expression. Neutrophil elastase and non‐metalloproteinase‐derived gelatinolytic activity were increased in plasma from ICU patients. Significantly higher levels of circulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP‐1) in patients at ICU admission yielded decreased total MMP proteolytic activity in blood. COVID‐19 neutrophils were hyper‐responsive to CXCL8 and CXCL12 in shape change assays. Finally, SARS‐CoV‐2 failed to replicate inside human neutrophils.ConclusionOur study provides detailed insights into the kinetics of neutrophil phenotype and function in severe COVID‐19 patients, and supports the concept of an increased neutrophil activation state in the circulation.","Metzemaekers, Mieke Cambier Seppe Blanter Marfa Vandooren Jennifer de Carvalho Ana Carolina Bert Malengier‐Devlies Vanderbeke Lore Jacobs Cato Coenen Sofie Martens Erik Pörtner Noëmie Vanbrabant Lotte Pierre Van Mol Yannick Van Herck Nathalie Van Aerde Hermans Greet Gunst Jan Borin Alexandre Bruna Toledo N.

We present a robust pipeline for data preprocessing, future demand inference, and a redistribution algorithm that can be adopted across broad scales and applications. RESULTS: The reinforcement learning redistribution algorithm demonstrates performance optimality ranging from 93-95%. Performance improves consistently with the number of random states participating in exchange, demonstrating average shortage reductions of 78.74% (± 30.8) in simulations with 5 states to 93.50% (± 0.003) with 50 states. CONCLUSION: These findings bolster confidence that reinforcement learning techniques can reliably guide resource allocation for future public health emergencies.","Bednarski, Bryan P; Singh, Akash Deep; Jones, William M",J. am. med. inform. assoc,547,16

AREAS COVERED: Data from observational studies suggest similar incidence attacks of SARS-CoV-2 infection in people living with HIV (PLWH) and HIV-uninfected populations. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is similar in both populations too. The authors discuss the role of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in preventing infection or reducing COVID-19 severity. They also discuss the pharmacological interventions for COVID-19 in PLWH. EXPERT OPINION: Management of COVID-19 in PLWH is no different from the general population. It should be based on careful supportive care, emphasizing lung-protective ventilation, and wise pharmacological interventions. The antiviral drug remdesivir and dexamethasone are the only pharmacological interventions with clinical benefit for COVID-19, whereas anticoagulation may prevent thrombotic complications. The experience with using these drugs in PLWH is limited, which prevents from rendering well-founded conclusions. Until more data on COVID-19 in PLWH become available, the best weapons within our reach are sound supportive care and sensible use of RDV and dexamethasone, bearing in mind the potential for drug-drug interactions of most corticosteroids and antiretroviral drugs.","Gutierrez, María Del Mar; Mur, Isabel; Mateo, María Gracia; Vidal, Francesc; Domingo, Pere",Expert Opin Pharmacother,547,12

BACKGROUND: The use of telemedicine has rapidly expanded and evolved since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Telemedicine eliminates the physical and geographic barriers to health care, preserves personal protective equipment, and prevents the spread of COVID-19 by allowing encounters to happen in a socially distanced way. However, few studies have assessed the patient perspective of telemedicine for headache care. METHODS: The American Migraine Foundation (AMF) designed a standardized electronic questionnaire to assess the patient experience of telemedicine for headache care between March and September 2020 to help inform future quality improvement as part of its patient advocacy initiative. The date parameters were identified as the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease and the declaration of a national emergency in the United States. The questionnaire was distributed electronically to more than 100,000 members of the AMF community through social media platforms and the AMF email database. RESULTS: A total of 1172 patients responded to our electronic questionnaire, with 1098 complete responses. The majority, 1081/1153 (93.8%) patients, had a previous headache diagnosis prior to the telemedicine encounter. A total of 648/1127 (57.5%) patients reported that they had used telemedicine for headache care during the study period. Among those who participated in telehealth visits, 553/647 (85.5%) patients used it for follow-up visits; 94/647 (14.5%) patients used it for new patient visits. During the telemedicine encounters, 282/645 (43.7%) patients were evaluated by headache specialists, 222/645 (34.4%) patients by general neurologists, 198/645 (30.7%) patients by primary care providers, 73/645 (11.3%) patients by headache nurse practitioners, and 21/645 (3.2%) patients by headache nurses. Only 47/633 (7.4%) patients received a new headache diagnosis from telemedicine evaluation, whereas the other 586/633 (92.6%) patients did not have a change in their diagnoses. During these visits, a new treatment was prescribed for 358/636 (52.3%) patients, whereas 278/636 (43.7%) patients did not have changes made to their treatment plan. The number (%) of patients who rated the telemedicine headache care experience as ""very good,"" ""good,"" ""fair,"" ""poor,"" and ""other"" were 396/638 (62.1%), 132/638 (20.7%), 67/638 (10.5%), 23/638 (3.6%), and 20/638 (3.1%), respectively. Detailed reasons for ""other"" are listed in the manuscript. Most patients, 573/638 (89.8%), indicated that they would prefer to continue to use telemedicine for their headache care, 45/638 (7.1%) patients would not, and 20/638 (3.1%) patients were unsure. CONCLUSIONS: Our study evaluating the patient perspective demonstrated that telemedicine facilitated headache care for many patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in high patient satisfaction rates, and a desire to continue to use telemedicine for future headache care among those who completed the online survey.","Chiang, Chia-Chun; Halker Singh, Rashmi; Lalvani, Nim; Shubin Stein, Ken; Henscheid Lorenz, Deborah; Lay, Christine; Dodick, David W; Newman, Lawrence C",Headache,547,1

Here, we introduce the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open science community focused on analyzing patient-level data from many centers. METHODS: The Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Program and scientific community created N3C to overcome technical, regulatory, policy, and governance barriers to sharing and harmonizing individual-level clinical data. We developed solutions to extract, aggregate, and harmonize data across organizations and data models, and created a secure data enclave to enable efficient, transparent, and reproducible collaborative analytics.Organized in inclusive workstreams, in two months we created: legal agreements and governance for organizations and researchers; data extraction scripts to identify and ingest positive, negative, and possible COVID-19 cases; a data quality assurance and harmonization pipeline to create a single harmonized dataset; population of the secure data enclave with data, machine learning, and statistical analytics tools; dissemination mechanisms; and a synthetic data pilot to democratize data access. DISCUSSION: The N3C has demonstrated that a multi-site collaborative learning health network can overcome barriers to rapidly build a scalable infrastructure incorporating multi-organizational clinical data for COVID-19 analytics. We expect this effort to save lives by enabling rapid collaboration among clinicians, researchers, and data scientists to identify treatments and specialized care and thereby reduce the immediate and long-term impacts of COVID-19. LAY SUMMARY: COVID-19 poses societal challenges that require expeditious data and knowledge sharing. Though medical records are abundant, they are largely inaccessible to outside researchers. Statistical, machine learning, and causal research are most successful with large datasets beyond what is available in any given organization. Here, we introduce the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), an open science community focused on analyzing patient-level data from many clinical centers to reveal patterns in COVID-19 patients. To create N3C, the community had to overcome technical, regulatory, policy, and governance barriers to sharing patient-level clinical data. In less than 2 months, we developed solutions to acquire and harmonize data across organizations and created a secure data environment to enable transparent and reproducible collaborative research. We expect the N3C to help save lives by enabling collaboration among clinicians, researchers, and data scientists to identify treatments and specialized care needs and thereby reduce the immediate and long-term impacts of COVID-19.","Melissa, Haendel; Christopher, Chute; Kenneth, Gersing",J. am. med. inform. assoc,547,22

Odds of increased severity of disease presentation were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Cholecystitis admissions decreased 48.7% from 5.2 to 2.67 cases (RR 0.51 [0.28,0.96], P = 0.04) following pandemic declaration when comparing 2020 to historical control (P = 0.02). After stratifying by severity, only Tokyo I admissions declined significantly postdeclaration (RR 0.42 [0.18,0.97]), when compared to historical control (P = 0.02). There was no change in odds of presenting with severe disease after the pandemic declaration (aOR 1.00 [95% CI 0.30, 3.38] P < 0.99) despite significantly longer lengths of symptoms reported in mild cases. CONCLUSIONS: Postpandemic declaration we experienced a significant decrease in cholecystitis admissions without corresponding increases in disease severity. The pandemic impacted healthcare-seeking behaviors, with fewer mild presentations. Given that the pandemic did not increase odds of presenting with increased severity of disease, our data suggests that not all mild cases of cholecystitis progress to worsening disease and some may resolve without medical or surgical intervention.","Vallès, Katherine F; Neufeld, Miriam Y; Caron, Elisa; Sanchez, Sabrina E; Brahmbhatt, Tejal S",J Surg Res,547,22

We validated the proposed method in 12 human disease datasets and performed an in-depth study of patients with mild and severe symptomatology of the coronavirus disease 2019 for predicting novel therapeutic targets. As a result, we identified the extracellular matrix protein versican and Toll-like receptor 2 as potential targets for modulating the inflammatory response.

RT use has developed widespread interest due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and has future potential to address the needs of a rapidly aging population, improve access to care, facilitate interprofessional team care, and ensure appropriate use of resources. However, despite rapid and increasing interest in implementation of RT, there is little research concerning practices for successful implementation. We conducted a systematic review and qualitative evidence synthesis of practices that impact the implementation of RT for adults seeking clinical care advice. We searched MEDLINE®, EMBASE, and CINAHL from inception through July 2018. We included 32 studies in this review. Our review identified four themes impacting the implementation of RT: characteristics of staff who use RT, influence of RT on staff, considerations in selecting RT tools, and environmental and contextual factors impacting RT. The findings of our systemic review underscore the need for a careful consideration of (a) organizational and stakeholder buy-in before launch, (b) physical and psychological workplace environment, (c) staff training and ongoing support, and (d) optimal metrics to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of implementation. Our findings indicate that preimplementation planning, as well as evaluating RT by collecting data during and after implementation, is essential to ensuring successful implementation and continued adoption of RT in a health care system.","Lewinski, Allison A; Rushton, Sharron; Van Voorhees, Elizabeth; Boggan, Joel C; Whited, John D; Shoup, John P; Tabriz, Amir A; Adam, Soheir; Fulton, Jessica; Gordon, Adelaide M; Ear, Belinda; Williams, John W; Goldstein, Karen M; Van Noord, Megan G; Gierisch, Jennifer M",Res Nurs Health,547,5

This role can stipulate a groundwork for further investigation of the pathophysiologic importance of complement in COVID-19, and could propose targets for specific intervention. In addition, we delineated current treatments for thrombosis and the potential therapies by using agents to block the terminal complement pathway. Low molecular weight heparin for all (unless contraindicated) hospitalized COVID-19 patients can be lifesaving.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis of claims data. SETTING: The USA; 2018-2019 influenza season. PARTICIPANTS: Main cohort: people with hypertension (HTN) taking an ACEi, ARB or other HTN medications, and experiencing AVRI. Falsification cohort: parallel cohort receiving elective knee or hip replacement. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main cohort: hospital admission, intensive care unit, acute respiratory distress (ARD), ARD syndrome and all-cause mortality. Falsification cohort: complications after surgery and all-cause mortality. RESULTS: The main cohort included 236 843 episodes of AVRI contributed by 202 629 unique individuals. Most episodes were in women (58.9%), 81.4% in people with Medicare Advantage and 40.3% in people aged 75+ years. Odds of mortality were lower in the ACEi (0.78 (0.74 to 0.83)) and ARB (0.64 (0.61 to 0.68)) cohorts compared with other HTN medications. On all other outcomes, people taking ARBs (but not ACEis) had a >10% reduction in odds of inpatient stays compared with other HTN medications.In the falsification analysis (N=103 353), both ACEis (0.89 (0.80 to 0.98)) and ARBs (0.82 (0.74 to 0.91)) were associated with decreased odds of complications compared with other HTN medications; ARBs (0.64 (0.47 to 0.87)) but not ACEis (0.79 (0.60 to 1.05)) were associated with lower odds of death compared with other HTN medications. CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient use of ARBs was associated with better outcomes with AVRI compared with other medications for HTN. ACEis were associated with reduced risk of death, but with minimal or no reduction in risk of other complications. A falsification analysis conducted to provide context on the possible causal implications of these findings did not provide a clear answer. Further analysis using observational data will benefit from additional approaches to assess causal relationships between these drugs and outcomes in AVRI.","Jeffery, Molly Moore; Cummins, Nathan W; Dempsey, Timothy M; Limper, Andrew H; Shah, Nilay D; Bellolio, Fernanda",BMJ Open,547,16

Healthcare professionals' (HCPs) recommendations have significant influence on general public vaccination behavior. The aim of this study was to assess the willingness of HCPs to get vaccinated against COVID-19, two weeks before initiation of vaccinations. Materials and Methods: We conducted an anonymous online survey from 11-15 December 2020 among HCPs by emails delivered from the local medical and nursing stuff associations. Results: The 71.1% of 656 HCPs intended to accept vaccination, 5.9% did not and 23% were still undecided. The acceptance rate was higher in physicians (76.5%) and significantly lower in nurses (48.3%). Most of the responders who intended to accept vaccination were males (p = 0.01), physicians (p = 0.001), older (p = 0.02), married (p = 0.054) with children (p = 0.001), and had treated patients with COVID-19 (p < 0.001). In the multivariate logistic regression, the predictors of HCPs willingness to get vaccinated were parenthood (OR = 4.19, p = 0.003), being a physician (OR = 2.79, p = 0.04), and treating confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients (OR = 2.87, p = 0.036). Conclusions: Low vaccination acceptance rate was found especially in nurses, and as this may have a negative impact in the vaccination compliance of the general public, interventional educational programs to enhance vaccination are crucial.","Pataka, Athanasia; Kotoulas, Seraphim; Stefanidou, Emilia; Grigoriou, Ioanna; Tzinas, Asterios; Tsiouprou, Ioanna; Zarogoulidis, Paul; Courcoutsakis, Nikolaos; Argyropoulou, Paraskevi",Medicina (Kaunas),547,1

Concurrently, our host nation, which previously had reported the highest number of daily deaths from COVID-19, was deep within a second wave of infections, increasing hospital admissions, near intensive care unit capacity, and deaths. As USNH Rota was not normally equipped for the complex infusion center required to effectively deliver the monoclonal antibody, we coordinated a multi-directorate and multidisciplinary effort in order to set up an infusion room that could be dedicated to help with our fight against COVID. Identifying a physician team lead, with subject matter experts from nursing, pharmacy, facilities, and enlisted corpsmen, our team carefully ensured that all requisite steps were set up in advance in order to be able to identify the appropriate patients proactively and treat them safely with the infusion that has been clinically proven to decrease hospital admissions and mortality. Additional benefits included the establishment of an additional negative pressure room near our emergency room for both COVID-19 patients and, when needed, the monoclonal antibody infusion. In mid-January, a COVID-19-positive patient meeting the clinical criteria for monoclonal antibody infusion was safely administered this potentially life-saving medication, a first for small overseas hospitals.

METHODS: Systematic review of published scientific evidence. A search of six bibliographic databases and grey literature was executed to identify relevant studies conducted in Malawi in the English language, with no time or study design restrictions. Data extraction was conducted in Excel and evidence synthesis followed a thematic analysis approach to identify and compare emerging themes. RESULTS: One hundred and one unique records were retrieved and 6 studies were selected for final inclusion in the review. Multiple factors affect breast and cervical cancer service delivery in Malawi, operating at three interlinked levels. At the patient level, lack of knowledge and awareness of the disease, location, poor screening environment and perceived quality of care may act as deterrent to participation in screening; at the health facility level, services are affected by the availability of resources and delivery modalities; and at the healthcare system level, inadequate funding and staffing (distribution, supervision, retention), and lack of appropriate monitoring and guidelines may have a negative impact on services. Convenience of screening, in terms of accessibility (location, opening times) and integration with other health services (e.g. reproductive or HIV services), was found to have a positive effect on service uptake. Building awareness of cancer and related services, and offering quality screening (dedicated room, privacy, staff professionalism etc.) are significant determinants of patient satisfaction.

Rapid transmission and high mortality rates, as well as prolonged and asymptomatic communal periods, are the most important reasons for the global panic due to coronavirus. Since coronavirus treatment and specific vaccines are not yet available, early detection of the virus is critical. A rapid and accurate diagnosis can play a crucial role in the treatment and control of the COVID 19 disease. Serological, ELISA, and molecular-based tests, including PCR and RT-PCR, are among the most important routine methods for detecting coronaviruses. False-positive/negative results, low sensitivity and specificity, and the need for advanced equipment are among the disadvantages and problems of routine methods. To eliminate the drawbacks of routine methods, new technologies are being developed. Biosensors are one of the most important ones.

Electrical impedance values of emulsions obtained at different emulsification speeds were estimated according to the frequency response data with frequencies ranging from 1 MHz to 1 Hz. The equivalent circuit model of toluene-in-water emulsion was established by the resistor (RO/W) and capacitor (CO/W) in parallel connection. Nyquist diagrams for the emulsions prepared by toluene and water were characterized by the formation of one semi-circle. The droplet size distribution is one of the important factors that affect the stability of the emulsion, except for the volume fraction of water and oil, the size of stabilizing particles, etc. The average particle size of the emulsion droplets decreased as the emulsification speed increased, indicating the higher stability of the emulsion. It was found that the fitted impedance value RO/W of the emulsion decreased with decreasing particle size prepared at different emulsification speeds and storage time by performing real-time EIS detection techniques. The results suggested that EIS could be used to characterize the stability of a toluene-in-water emulsion stabilized by FcA modified silica nanoparticles. Moreover, based on the good electrochemical activity of the FcA molecule, the stability of the Pickering emulsion can be modulated by adding oxidant and reductant and detected by EIS in real-time.","Jiang, Qiuyan; Sun, Ning; Kumar, Parveen; Li, Qiuhong; Liu, Bo; Li, Aixiang; Wang, Weiwei; Gao, Zengli",Molecules (Basel),547,1

Studies are needed to directly compare multiple commercially available assays. METHODS: Residual serum samples were identified based on SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing, clinical test results, and collection dates. Serum samples were analyzed using assays from four different manufacturers: DiaSorin anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG, EUROIMMUN anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA, Roche Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2, and Siemens SARS-CoV-2 Total antibody assays. RESULTS: Samples from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients became increasingly positive as time from symptom onset increased. For patients with latest sample 14 or more days after symptom onset, sensitivities reached 93.1% to 96.6%, 98.3%, and 96.6% for EUROIMMUN, Roche, and Siemens assays, respectively, which were superior to the DiaSorin assay at 87.7%. The specificity of Roche and Siemens assays was 100% and superior to DiaSorin and EUROIMMUN assays, which ranged from 96.1% to 97.0% and 86.3% to 96.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Laboratories should be aware of the advantages and limitations of serology testing options for SARS-CoV-2. The specificity and sensitivity achieved by the Roche and Siemens assays would be acceptable for testing in lower-prevalence regions and have the potential of orthogonal testing advantages if used in combination.","Manthei, David M; Whalen, Jason F; Schroeder, Lee F; Sinay, Anthony M; Li, Shih-Hon; Valdez, Riccardo; Giacherio, Donald A; Gherasim, Carmen",Am. j. clin. pathol,547,1

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING: PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched for related information. The authors developed a data extraction form on an Excel sheet and the following data from eligible studies were extracted: author, country, sample size, number of female patients and number of male patients. Using STATA V.14 for analysis, the authors pooled the overall prevalence of men and/or women using a random-effect meta-analysis model. The authors examined the heterogeneity in effect size using Q statistics and I2 statistics. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed. Publication bias was also checked. PARTICIPANTS: Studies on COVID-19 confirmed cases were included. INTERVENTION: Sex (male/female) of COVID-19 confirmed cases was considered. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was prevalence of COVID-19 among men and women. RESULTS: A total of 57 studies with 221 195 participants were used in the analysis. The pooled prevalence of COVID-19 among men was found to be 55.00 (51.43-56.58, I2=99.5%, p<0.001). Sensitivity analysis showed the findings were not dependent on a single study. Moreover, a funnel plot showed symmetrical distribution. Egger's regression test p value was not significant, which indicates absence of publication bias in both outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 was found to be higher in men than in women. The high prevalence of smoking and alcohol consumption contributed to the high prevalence of COVID-19 among men. Additional studies on the discrepancies in severity and mortality rate due to COVID-19 among men and women and the associated factors are recommended.","Abate, Biruk Beletew; Kassie, Ayelign Mengesha; Kassaw, Mesfin Wudu; Aragie, Teshome Gebremeskel; Masresha, Setamlak Adane",BMJ Open,547,29

In the outbreak of COVID-19, we generated a lipopeptide EK1V1 by modifying EK1 with cholesterol, which exhibited significantly improved antiviral activity. In this study, we surprisingly found that EK1V1 also displayed potent cross-inhibitory activities against divergent HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolates. Consistently, the recently reported EK1 derivative EK1C4 and SARS-CoV-2 derived fusion inhibitor lipopeptides (IPB02 â¼ IPB09) also inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion and infection efficiently. In the inhibition of a panel of HIV-1 mutants resistant to HIV-1 fusion inhibitors, EK1V1 and IPB02-based inhibitors exhibited significantly decreased or increased activities, suggesting the heptad repeat-1 region (HR1) of HIV-1 gp41 being their target. Furthermore, the sequence alignment and molecular docking analyses verified the target site and revealed the mechanism underlying the resistance. Combined, we conclude that this serendipitous discovery provides a proof-of-concept for a common mechanism of viral fusion and critical information for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals.","Yu, Danwei; Zhu, Yuanmei; Yan, Hongxia; Wu, Tong; Chong, Huihui; He, Yuxian",Emerg Microbes Infect,547,14

During the lockdown and unlock phases, BC decreased up to 78% compared to the PL period. The BC source apportionment studies show that fossil fuel burning was the dominant BC source during the entire sampling period. From L1 to UN2 an increasing trend in BCff contribution was observed (except L3) due to the successive relaxations given to anthropogenic activities. BCff contribution dipped briefly during L3 due to the intensive crop residue burning events in neighboring states. CWT analysis showed that local emission sources were the dominant contributors to BC concentration over Delhi.","Goel, Vikas; Hazarika, Naba; Kumar, Mayank; Singh, Vikram; Thamban, Navaneeth M; Tripathi, Sachchida Nand",Chemosphere,547,20

Such low ozone, over several months, and at so many stations, has not been observed in any previous year since at least 2000. Atmospheric composition analyses from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service and simulations from the NASA GMI model indicate that the large 2020 springtime ozone depletion in the Arctic stratosphere contributed less than one-quarter of the observed tropospheric anomaly. The observed anomaly is consistent with recent chemistry-climate model simulations, which assume emissions reductions similar to those caused by the COVID-19 crisis.

We show that convalescent-phase sera neutralize pseudotyped viruses with the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.1.248, COH.20G/677H, 20A.EU2, and mink cluster 5 spike proteins with only a minor loss in titer. Similarly, antibodies elicited by Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccination neutralized B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 with only a 3-fold decrease in titer, an effect attributable to E484K. Analysis of the Regeneron monoclonal antibodies REGN10933 and REGN10987 showed that REGN10933 has lost neutralizing activity against the B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 pseudotyped viruses, and the cocktail is 9- to 15-fold decreased in titer. These findings suggest that antibodies elicited by natural infection and by the Pfizer vaccine will maintain protection against the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.1.248 variants but that monoclonal antibody therapy may be less effective for patients infected with B.1.351 or B.1.1.248 SARS-CoV-2.

We report here on an analysis of sera from recovered patients and vaccinated individuals and on neutralization by Regeneron therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Overall, the variants were neutralized nearly as well as the wild-type pseudotyped virus. The B.1.351 variant was somewhat resistant to vaccine-elicited antibodies but was still readily neutralized. One of the two Regeneron therapeutic monoclonal antibodies seems to have lost most of its activity against the B.1.351 variant, raising concerns that the combination therapy might be less effective for some patients. The findings should alleviate concerns that vaccines will become ineffective but suggest the importance of continued surveillance for potential new variants.","Tada, Takuya; Dcosta, Belinda M; Samanovic, Marie I; Herati, Ramin S; Cornelius, Amber; Zhou, Hao; Vaill, Ada; Kazmierski, Wes; Mulligan, Mark J; Landau, Nathaniel R",mBio,547,15

Among the most frequently purchased products, the greatest amounts were spent on face masks (US$4.5 million), acetaminophen (US$2.2 million), and reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay kits (US$1.8 million). Prices varied greatly, depending on each individual contract and on the number of units purchased; some were exceptionally higher than their market value. Compared with 2019, the mean price of medical examination gloves increased up to 1,307%, acetaminophen 500 mg pills, up to 796%, and oxygen flasks, 30.8%. In a context of budgetary constraints that actually required an effective use of available funds, speculative price hikes may have limited patient access to health care and the protection of the general population and health care workers. COVID-19 vaccine allocations to privileged individuals have also been widely reported. Price caps and other forms of regulation, as well as greater scrutiny and transparency of government-driven purchases, and investment in local production, are warranted in Ecuador for improved infectious disease prevention.","Ortiz-Prado, Esteban; Fernandez-Naranjo, Raul; Torres-Berru, Yeferson; Lowe, Rachel; Torres, Irene",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,547,24

Although chest computed tomography (CT) represents the gold standard to assess lung involvement, with a specificity superior even to that of the nasopharyngeal swab for diagnosis, lung ultrasound examination can be a valid alternative to CT scan, with certain advantages, particularly for pregnant women. Ultrasound can be performed directly at the bed-side by a single operator, reducing the risk of spreading the disease among health professionals. Furthermore, it is a radiation-free exam, making it safer and easier to monitor those patients who require a series of exams. We report on four cases of pregnant women affected by COVID-19 who were monitored with lung ultrasound examination. All patients showed sonographic features indicative of COVID-19 pneumonia at admission: irregular pleural lines and vertical artifacts (B-lines) were observed in all four cases, and patchy areas of white lung were observed in two. Lung ultrasound was more sensitive than was chest X-ray in detecting COVID-19. In three patients, we observed almost complete resolution of lung pathology on ultrasound within 96 h of admission. Two pregnancies were ongoing at the time of writing, and two had undergone Cesarean delivery with no fetal complications. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of cord blood and newborn swabs was negative in both of these cases. Copyright © 2020 ISUOG.

Few studies have reported COVID-19 specific tracheotomy outcomes, and the optimal timing and patient selection criteria for tracheotomy remains undetermined. We delineate our outcomes for tracheotomies performed on COVID-19 patients during the peak of the pandemic at a major epicenter in the United States. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational cohort study. Mortality, ventilation liberation rate, complication rate, and decannulation rate were analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients with COVID-19 underwent tracheotomy between April 1, 2020 and May 19, 2020 at two tertiary care hospitals in Bronx, New York. The average duration of intubation prior to tracheotomy was 20 days ((interquartile range [IQR] 16.5-26.0). The mortality rate was 33% (n = 21), the ventilation liberation rate was 47% (n = 30), the decannulation rate was 28% (n = 18), and the complication rate was 19% (n = 12). Tracheotomies performed by Otolaryngology were associated with significantly improved survival (P < .05) with 60% of patients alive at the conclusion of the study compared to 9%, 12%, and 19% of patients undergoing tracheotomy performed by Critical Care, General Surgery, and Pulmonology, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: So far, this is the second largest study describing tracheotomy outcomes in COVID-19 patients in the United States. Our early outcomes demonstrate successful ventilation liberation and decannulation in COVID-19 patients. Further inquiry is necessary to determine the optimal timing and identification of patient risk factors predictive of improved survival in COVID-19 patients undergoing tracheotomy.

A large number of expressed genes, proteins, metabolites and extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) exhibit strong associations with various clinical parameters. Multiple sets of tissue-specific proteins and exRNAs varied significantly in both mild and severe patients suggesting a potential impact on tissue function. Chronic activation of neutrophils, IFN-I signalling as well as a high level of inflammatory cytokines were observed in patients with severe disease progression. In contrast, COVID-19 patients experiencing milder disease symptoms showed robust T cell responses. Finally, we identified genes, proteins and exRNAs as potential biomarkers that might assist in predicting the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The goal of our study was to test whether pandemic-related stress was associated with food intake, and whether relationships between stress and intake were modified by appetitive and cognitive traits. (2) Methods: We cross-sectionally surveyed 428 adults to examine current intake frequency of various food types (sweets/desserts, savory snacks, fast food, fruits, and vegetables), changes to food intake during the pandemic, emotional overeating (EOE), cognitive flexibility (CF), and COVID-19-related stress. Models tested associations of stress, EOE, and CF with food intake frequency and changes to intake. (3) Results: Models demonstrated that the positive relationship between stress and intake of sweets/desserts was stronger with higher EOE, while the positive relationship between stress and intake of chips/savory snacks was weaker with higher CF. Higher EOE was associated with greater risk of increased intake of palatable foods. (4) Conclusions: Findings suggest that emotional overeating may escalate stress-associated intake of high-sugar foods, and cognitive flexibility may attenuate stress-associated intake of high-fat foods. Differences in appetitive and cognitive traits may explain changes to and variability in food intake during COVID-19, and efforts to decrease emotional overeating and encourage cognitive flexibility could help lessen the effect of COVID-19-related stress on energy dense food intake.","Sadler, Jennifer R; Thapaliya, Gita; Jansen, Elena; Aghababian, Anahys H; Smith, Kimberly R; Carnell, Susan",Nutrients,547,24

The key targets of COVID-19, protease (PDB ID: 7BQY) and RNA polymerase (PDB ID: 7bV2) were used to dock our target compounds by Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) version 2014.09. We used 3 different conformations of protease target (6M0K, 6Y2F and 7BQY) and two different score functions to strengthen the probability of inhibitors discovery. After an extensive screening analysis, 20 compounds exhibit good binding affinities to one or both COVID-19 targets. 7 out of 20 compounds were predicted to overcome the activity of both targets. The top 7 hits are, flacourticin (3), sagerinic acid (16), hordatine A (23), hordatine B (24), N-feruloyl tyramine dimer (25), bisavenanthramides B-5 (29) and vulnibactins (40). According to our results, all these top hits was found to have a better binding scores than remdesivir, the native ligand in RNA polymerase target (PDB ID: 7bV2). Hordatines are phenolic compounds present in barley, were found to exhibit the highest binding affinity to both protease and polymerase through forming strong hydrogen bonds with the catalytic residues, as well as significant interactions with other receptor-binding residues. These results probably provided an excellent lead candidate for the development of therapeutic drugs against COVID-19. Eventually, animal experiment and accurate clinical trials are needed to confirm the preventive potentials of these compounds.

RESULTS: 35 relevant studies reporting 3979 patients with hip fracture in the current ongoing pandemic, out of which 692 patients were COVID -19 positive. Twenty studies reported mortality and other relevant statistics on hip fracture patients with and without COVID 19 (4123 hip fracture patients in the year 2020–21, out of which 560 had or were suspected of having COVID -19). A meta-analysis of mortality statistics in patients with and without COVID revealed increased odds of mortality among COVID patients [odds ratio (OR) 6.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) [5.09, 7.83] and meta-analysis on the subgroup of surgically treated patients also showed markedly increased mortality risk among those with COVID-19 (OR) 5.99, 95% CI [3.88,9.24]. CONCLUSION: The mortality risk is markedly increased in hip fracture with concomitant COVID -19 compared to those without it. This increased risk persisted in those managed surgically. It could be due to the inflammation induced by the fracture or surgery for fracture fixation, further exacerbating inflammation, leading to cytokine storm. It is imperative that such patients are informed regarding increased mortality risk during the consent and shared decision-making process.","Patralekh, Mohit Kumar; Jain, Vijay Kumar; Iyengar, Karthikeyan P.; Upadhyaya, Gaurav Kumar; Vaishya, Raju",J Clin Orthop Trauma,547,26

Recent in vitro studies have shown fluoxetine inhibits the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) pathogen and one clinical study reported fluoxetine exposure at a median dose of 20mg in patients with the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had a significantly lower risk of intubation and death. The aim of this study is to conduct in silico population dosing simulations to quantify the percentage of patients achieving a trough level for the effective concentration resulting in 90% inhibition (EC90) of SARS-Cov-2 as reported in Calu-3 human lung cells. Methods. Population pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for a structural one-compartment model with first-order absorption was used to simulate fluoxetine concentration-time data. A population of 1,000 individuals were simulated at standard fluoxetine doses (20mg/day, 40mg/day, and 60mg/day) to estimate the percentage of the patients achieving a trough level for the EC90 SARS-Cov-2 inhibitory concentration at each day throughout a 10-day treatment period. All analyses were conducted via statistical programming in R. Results. Standard fluoxetine antidepressant doses resulted in a range of 79% to 97% of the patient population achieving a trough target plasma concentration of 25.1 ng/ml which translates to lung-tissue distribution coefficient of 60-times higher (EC90 of 4.02 M). At a dose of 40mg per day, at least 85% of patients will reach the trough target EC90 concentration within 3-days. The findings of this pharmacokinetic dosing study corroborate both in vitro and observational clinical study findings showing fluoxetine inhibits the SARS-Cov-2 pathogen at commonly treated doses in the practice of psychiatry.","Eugene, A.

Malnutrition is common and may also contribute to the development of the geriatric syndromes in older adults. Malnutrition in the old is reflected by either involuntary weight loss or low body mass index, but hidden deficiencies such as micronutrient deficiencies are more difficult to assess and therefore frequently overlooked in the community-dwelling old. In developed countries, the most cited cause of malnutrition is disease, as both acute and chronic disorders have the potential to result in or aggravate malnutrition. Therefore, as higher age is one risk factor for developing disease, older adults have the highest risk of being at nutritional risk or becoming malnourished. However, the aetiology of malnutrition is complex and multifactorial, and the development of malnutrition in the old is most likely also facilitated by ageing processes. This comprehensive narrative review summarizes current evidence on the prevalence and determinants of malnutrition in old adults spanning from age-related changes to disease-associated risk factors, and outlines remaining challenges in the understanding, identification as well as treatment of malnutrition, which in some cases may include targeted supplementation of macro- and/or micronutrients, when diet alone is not sufficient to meet age-specific requirements.","Norman, Kristina; Haß, Ulrike; Pirlich, Matthias",Nutrients,547,18

This study explored the feeding experiences and support of caregivers with children who have CP. A qualitative approach was used where semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted and audio recorded. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyse the transcribed interview data from the eleven mothers that participated. Four major themes were identified from the data: Child-centred world, Making decisions, Knowing their child, and Seeking and receiving support. Caregivers knew their child’s unique needs and made daily decisions around feeding based upon the child’s feedback and changing condition. Family support was viewed as important, although the caregivers still reported feeling stressed. Health professional support varied from “amazing” to “frustrating”, which contributed to the caregivers’ stress. However, no single support strategy was appropriate as their needs or preferences varied. It is recommended that health professionals take an individualised partnership approach with caregivers and their child, with particular attention to those caregivers who lack a friend or family support and those who are physically isolated.","Taylor, Christine; Kong, Ariana C.; Foster, Jann; Badawi, Nadia; Novak, Iona",J Child Fam Stud,547,1

Unlike the traditional recycling approaches whereby C&D waste is transported to off-site facilities for treatment, construction managers are actively exploring the possibility of on-site recycling where C&D waste is treated directly at source. This study reports the barriers and facilitators of implementing on-site C&D waste recycling by contextualizing it in Hong Kong. It does so by adopting a mixed-method approach combining case study, site visits, and interviews. It is discovered that the barriers include (1) site space constraints, (2) narrow window of opportunity to trade recycled products, (3) vulnerable business case, (4) lack of support from off-site recycling, and (5) lack of government policy support. A series of facilitating measures are also proposed, including (1) developing customized on-site recycling equipment, (2) establishing a demand-supply information-sharing platform, (3) developing more thriving off-site recycling, and (4) providing more government support. This study probes into the real-life on- and off-site waste recycling practices in Hong Kong's prominent C&D management system. It can also provide useful references for others in developing their own C&D waste recycling strategies by rationally deploying on- and off-site recycling.","Bao, Zhikang; Lee, Wendy M.W.; Lu, Weisheng",Sci Total Environ,547,1

METHODS: In this retrospective study we analyzed data from patients seen at three EDs and tested for COVID-19 between April 6 through May 4, 2020. The primary outcome was the test positivity rate by race and ethnicity, and the secondary outcome was 30 day in-hospital mortality. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine associations with COVID-19 test positivity. RESULTS: There were 526 patients tested for COVID-19, of whom 95 (18.1%) tested positive. The mean age of patients tested was 54.2 years, 54.7% were male, and 76.1% had at least one medical comorbidity. Black patients accounted for 40.7% of those tested but 16.8% of the positive tests, and Latinx patients accounted for 26.4% of those tested but 58.9% of the positive tests. The test positivity rate among Latinx patients was 40.3% (56/139) compared with 10.1% (39/387) among non-Latinx patients (p < 0.001).

DESIGN: Population-based prospective cohort study on archive data. SETTING: Preventive services and hospital care in the Reggio Emilia province, northern Italy. PARTICIPANTS: All 1162 subjects testing positive to RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Reggio Emilia province with at least 30 days of follow-up by 22 April 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Median times from diagnosis and from symptom onset to viral clearance with IQR assessed using the Kaplan–Meier estimator, stratified by included characteristics. The probability of viral clearance confirmation, stratified by time from diagnosis and putative determinants assessed using a multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: Viral clearance was achieved by 60.6% (704/1162) of patients, with a median time of 30 days from diagnosis (IQR 23–40) and 36 days from symptom onset (IQR 28–45). Of those negative and retested, 78.7% (436/554) had viral clearance confirmation, suggesting one in five false negative tests. The time from symptom onset to viral clearance slightly increased with age, from 35 (IQR 26–44) days under age 50 to 38 (IQR 28–44) in over age 80, and with disease severity, from 33 (IQR 25–41) days in non-hospitalised subjects to 38 (IQR 30–47) days in hospitalised patients. The probability of confirmed viral clearance reached 86.8% after 34 days from symptom onset and increased with time, even when adjusting for age and sex (OR 1.16 95% CI 1.06 to 1.26 per day from diagnosis).

This study aims to explore whether incorporating meteorological factors can improve the performance of time series models in predicting PTB. METHODS: We collected the monthly reported number of PTB cases and records of six meteorological factors in three cities of China from 2005 to 2018. Based on this data, we constructed three time series models, including an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, the ARIMA with exogenous variables (ARIMAX) model, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) model. The ARIMAX and RNN models incorporated meteorological factors, while the ARIMA model did not. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to evaluate the performance of the models in predicting PTB cases in 2018. RESULTS: Both the cross-correlation analysis and Spearman rank correlation test showed that PTB cases reported in the study areas were related to meteorological factors. The predictive performance of both the ARIMA and RNN models was improved after incorporating meteorological factors. The MAPEs of the ARIMA, ARIMAX, and RNN models were 12.54%, 11.96%, and 12.36% in Xuzhou, 15.57%, 11.16%, and 14.09% in Nantong, and 9.70%, 9.66%, and 12.50% in Wuxi, respectively.

Disaster-related traumatic stress events increase the risk of substance abuse. Therefore, the COVID-19 outbreak, as a stress event, inevitably has a negative impact on Chinese adolescents with Internet addiction. METHODS: In 2020, 1787 copies of the questionnaire were randomly distributed among adolescents aged 12–16 years in three communities in Shandong Province, China. Among the respondents, 121 Internet addicts voluntarily participated and were divided into the experiment group (60 members) and the control group (61 members). Logotherapy-based mindfulness intervention was carried out on the experiment group. The effects of the intervention were analyzed after eight weeks of intervention. RESULTS: After the intervention, significant decreases occurred in the scores of Internet addiction and its five dimensions in the experiment group (P < 0.05), thereby implying better invention effects in the experiment group than the control group. The experiment group exhibited an increase in the positive coping score and a decrease in the negative coping score (P < 0.05). Significant decreases were found in the anxiety and depression scores in the experiment group (P < 0.05).

Unfortunately, recent reports indicate that PPE shortages persist amidst continually increasing caseloads nationwide. Additionally, there have been reports of poor-fitting masks, a problem which is magnified by shortages. The lack of adequate access to conventional N95 masks pushed for some to pursue 3D printing and locally distributing their own manufactured masks as substitutes when PPE, including N95 masks, were not readily available. The design presented, the snorkel mask adapter, is one such design born from the local maker community in partnership with local physicians and hospitals. This article discusses the design, manufacturing, and validation of the snorkel mask adapter and its immediate use in the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future use as stopgap PPE. Methods The design presented is an adapter which can be used with a commercially available snorkel mask in order to serve as a full face respirator in either the case of a PPE shortage or more pertinently for those who are unable to pass fit testing with the available N95 respirators at their respective facilities. Mask components were 3D printed, assembled, and then fit tested by qualitative fit testing (QLFT) at The University of Kansas Health System (TUKHS) in Kansas City, KS as a proof of concept. Results At TUKHS, the mask was fit tested on 22 individuals who required an N95 mask but were not able to pass qualitative fit testing with the masks available to them at the time. Of the 22 tested, all 22 of them were able to pass QLFT with the snorkel mask, adapter, and viral/bacterial filter combination. Conclusion The results of the fit testing at TUKHS is promising for this N95 alternative. More extensive testing can and should be done, including quantitative fit testing. Persistently increasing caseloads and PPE shortages necessitates an urgent dissemination of these preliminary results. The authors do not advocate for this design as a replacement of traditional N95 masks or other PPE but do endorse this design as a stopgap measure, proven to be effective in situations of dire PPE shortage or for individuals who have failed fit testing with conventional PPE.","Dalla, S.; Shinde, R.; Ayres, J.

However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV–host interactome and drug targets in the human protein–protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV–host interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the “Complementary Exposure” pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV–host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.","Zhou, Yadi; Hou, Yuan; Shen, Jiayu; Huang, Yin; Martin, William; Cheng, Feixiong",Cell Discov,547,7

We analyze online survey data from the nationally representative “Understanding America Study” (UAS) covering the period of March 10-31st 2020 (sample size: 6,585). Mental health is assessed by the validated PHQ-4 instrument for measuring symptoms of depression and anxiety. About 29% (CI:27.4-.30.4%) of the US adult population reported some depression/anxiety symptoms over the study period, with symptoms deteriorating over the month of March. Worsening mental health was most strongly associated with concerns about the economic consequences of the pandemic, while concerns about the potential implications of the virus for respondents’ own health and social distancing also predicted increases in symptoms of depression and anxiety during the early stages of the pandemic in the US, albeit less strongly. Our findings point towards the possibility of a major mental health crisis unfolding simultaneously with the pandemic, with economic concerns being a key driving force of this crisis. These results highlight the likely importance of economic countermeasures and social policy for mitigating the impact of Covid-19 on adult mental health in the US over and above an effective public health response.","Kämpfen, Fabrice; Kohler, Iliana V.; Ciancio, Alberto; Bruine de Bruin, Wändi; Maurer, Jürgen; Kohler, Hans-Peter",PLoS One,547,32

METHODS: This was a retrospective, multi‐center, observational study. The clinical data of all suspected patients were analyzed. Independent risk factors were identified via multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Finally, 336 confirmed COVID‐19 patients and 139 control patients were included. We found nine independent risk factors for diagnosis with COVID‐19 at admission to hospital: epidemiological exposure histories (OR:13.32, 95%CI 6.39‐27.75), weakness/fatigue (OR:4.51, 95%CI 1.70‐11.96), heart rate <100 beat/min (OR:3.80, 95%CI 2.00‐7.22), bilateral pneumonia (OR:3.60, 95%CI 1.83‐7.10), neutrophil count ≤6.3×10(9)/L (OR: 6.77, 95%CI 2.52‐18.19), eosinophil count ≤0.02×10(9)/L (OR:3.14, 95%CI 1.58‐6.22), glucose ≥6 mmol/L (OR:2.43, 95%CI 1.04‐5.66), D‐dimer ≥0.5 mg/L (OR:3.49, 95%CI 1.22‐9.96), and C‐reactive protein <5 mg/L (OR:3.83, 95%CI 1.86‐7.92). As for the performance of this risk score, a cut‐off value of 20 (specificity: 0.866, sensitivity: 0.813) was identified to predict COVID‐19 according to ROC curve and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.921 (95%CI: 0.896‐0.945, p<0.01).

The proposed sensitivity is not higher than 60%, but its high specificity allows both quick decisions for the management of patients and confirmation by molecular diagnosis for only negative tests. However, from the first tests performed, we suspected that the sensitivity observed with routine use was much lower than that announced by the manufacturer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a period of one month, we compared the negative results obtained with the COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip kit with those obtained from qRT-PCR performed in a laboratory qualified for the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. All samples tested were naso-pharyngeal smears from UTM-RT medium. RESULTS: Of 774 patients tested, 714 negative samples were sent for confirmation, and 159 were found to be positive by qRT-PCR. The median positive percentage agreement was 23.9% (95% CI: 14.2%-38.2%). The Cohen’s kappa score was 0.35. CONCLUSION: Using this immunochromatographic assay as a triage test did not significantly reduce the number of samples outsourced for COVID-19 confirmation by qRT-PCR. In addition, even if the turn-around time is short, the assay is completely manual, which is not suitable for large volumes of routine samples. The sensitivity of this rapid test is poor, and improvements are needed to enhance its performance.","Blairon, Laurent; Wilmet, Alain; Beukinga, Ingrid; Tré-Hardy, Marie",J Clin Virol,547,17

METHODS: A total of 12 150 SARS-CoV-2 sequences (publicly available) from 69 countries were analysed. Mutational clusters were assessed by hierarchical clustering. Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) was used to select the best inhibitors of 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL-Pr) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) among the FDA-approved drugs and to evaluate the impact of mutations on binding affinity of these drugs. The impact of mutations on epitope recognition was predicted following Grifoni et al. (Cell Host Microbe 2020; 27: 671–80.) RESULTS: Thirty-five key mutations were identified (prevalence: ≥0.5%), residing in different viral proteins. Sixteen out of 35 formed tight clusters involving multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins, highlighting intergenic co-evolution. Some clusters (including D614G(Spike) + P323L(RdRp) + R203K(N) + G204R(N)) occurred in all continents, while others showed a geographically restricted circulation (T1198K(PL-Pr) + P13L(N) + A97V(RdRp) in Asia, L84S(ORF-8) + S197L(N) in Europe, Y541C(Hel) + H504C(Hel) + L84S(ORF-8) in America and Oceania). SBVS identified 20 best RdRp inhibitors and 21 best 3CL-Pr inhibitors belonging to different drug classes. Notably, mutations in RdRp or 3CL-Pr modulate, positively or negatively, the binding affinity of these drugs. Among them, P323L(RdRp) (prevalence: 61.9%) reduced the binding affinity of specific compounds including remdesivir while it increased the binding affinity of the purine analogues penciclovir and tenofovir, suggesting potential hypersusceptibility. Finally, specific mutations (including Y541C(Hel) + H504C(Hel)) strongly hampered recognition of Class I/II epitopes, while D614G(Spike) profoundly altered the structural stability of a recently identified B cell epitope target of neutralizing antibodies (amino acids 592–620). CONCLUSIONS: Key genetic elements reflect geographically dependent SARS-CoV-2 genetic adaptation, and may play a potential role in modulating drug susceptibility and hampering viral antigenicity. Thus, a close monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 mutational patterns is crucial to ensure the effectiveness of treatments and vaccines worldwide.","Salpini, Romina; Alkhatib, Mohammad; Costa, Giosuè; Piermatteo, Lorenzo; Ambrosio, Francesca Alessandra; Di Maio, Velia Chiara; Scutari, Rossana; Duca, Leonardo; Berno, Giulia; Fabeni, Lavinia; Alcaro, Stefano; Ceccherini-Silberstein, Francesca; Artese, Anna; Svicher, Valentina",J Antimicrob Chemother,547,5

While vaccines are being introduced into the market, there is also a pressing need to find potential drugs and therapeutic modules. Remdesivir is one of the antivirals currently being used with a limited window of action. As more drugs are being vetted, passive immunotherapy in the form of neutralizing antibodies can provide immediate action to combat the increasing numbers of COVID-positive cases. Herein, we demonstrate that equines hyper-immunized with chemically inactivated SARS-CoV-2 generate high titers of antibody with a strong virus neutralizing potential. ELISA performed with pooled antisera displayed highest immunoglobulin titer on 42 days post-immunization, at 1:51,200 dilutions. F(ab’)2 immunoglobulin fragments generated from the pools also showed very high, antigen-specific affinity at 1:102,400 dilutions. Finally, in vitro virus neutralization assays confirmed that different pools of F(ab’)2 fragments could successfully neutralize SARS-CoV-2 with titers well above 25,000, indicating the potential of this strategy in treating severe COVID-19 cases with high titers. The F(ab’)2 was able to cross neutralize another SARS-CoV-2 strain, demonstrating its efficacy against the emerging viral variants and the importance of this approach in our efforts of eradication of COVID-19. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that virus-neutralizing antibodies raised in equines can potentially be used as a treatment regimen in the form of effective passive immunotherapy to combat COVID-19.","Gupta, Divya; Ahmed, Farhan; Tandel, Dixit; Parthasarathy, Haripriya; Vedagiri, Dhiviya; Sah, Vishal; Krishna Mohan, B; Daga, Siddarth; Khan, Rafiq Ahmad; Kondiparthi, Chiranjeevi; Savari, Prabhudas; Jain, Sandesh; Daga, Jaya; Reddy, Shashikala; Khan, Nooruddin; Harshan, Krishnan Harinivas",bioRxiv,547,18

This inevitably raises questions about their role-related obligations and whether they should be free to choose not to endanger themselves. In this article, I argue that it is helpful to view this situation not only through the lens of “professional duty” but also through the lens of “role-related conflicts.” Doing so has the advantage of avoiding exceptionalism and allowing us to draw lessons not only from previous epidemics but also from a wide range of far more common role-related dilemmas in healthcare.","Lipworth, Wendy",J Bioeth Inq,547,8

Our past development trajectories have led to high emissions, persistent inequality and a world that is fragmented across multiple contradictions. How can countries shift to development pathways that deliver zero poverty and zero carbon? In developing a theory of just transition, the article begins by reviewing a range of theoretical approaches from different traditions, building in particular on neo-Gramscian approaches. It applies and modifies core components of Gramsci’s approach, building a neo-Gramscian theory of just transitions around concepts of ideology, hegemony, change agents and fundamental conditions. The theory suggests how coalitions of change agents can come together behind a just transition. The coalition needs to gain broader support, establish a new cultural hegemony in support of just transitions and be able to transform the fundamental conditions of the 21st century. The article briefly considers how this better understanding can be applied to the practice of shifting development pathways. The penultimate section reflects on limitations, including that a fuller development of a theory of just transition will require application for detailed concrete examples and a community effort. Together, we might address the multiple challenges of our present conditions to transition to development that enables human flourishing and a healthy planet.","Winkler, Harald",Energy Res Soc Sci,547,16

The Fresnel reflection light intensity detected by the LF-AOB greatly depended on the RI change on the end-surface of the fiber probe according to experimental and simulation results. The capability of the LF-AOB for real-time in situ detection in optofluidic system were verified by measuring salt and protein solution, and the lowest limit of detection was 1.0 × 10(−6) RIU. Our proposed theory can effectively eliminate the influence of light intensity fluctuation, and one-point calibration method of sensor performance is conducive for rapid and convenient detection of targets. Label-free sensitive detection of SARS-Cov-2 Spike protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) and the binding kinetics assay between S-RBD and anti-S-RBD antibody were achieved using the LF-AOB. These contributed to the elegant design of all-fiber optical system with high efficiency, high resolution and sensitivity of micro-photodetector, and enhanced interaction between the light and the samples at the liquid-sensor interface because of the large surface area of the multi-mode fiber probe.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional survey study that included all interviewing attending physicians and fellows from five Obstetrics and Gynecology subspecialties at a single academic institution following the 2020–2021 fellowship interview season. The survey consisted of 19 questions aimed to evaluate each subspecialty’s virtual interview process, including its feasibility and performance in evaluating applicants. The primary outcome was the subjective utility of virtual interviews. Secondary outcomes included a comparison of responses from fellows and attending physicians. RESULTS: Thirty-six attendings and fellows completed the survey (36/53, 68% response rate). Interviewers felt applicants were able to convey themselves adequately during the virtual interview (92%) and the majority (70%) agreed that virtual interviews should be offered in future years.

Respondents highlighted decreased cost, time saved, and increased flexibility as benefits to the virtual interview process. CONCLUSION: The use of virtual interviews provides a favorable method for conducting fellowship interviews and should be considered for use in future application cycles. Most respondents were satisfied with the virtual interview process and found they were an effective tool for evaluating applicants.

We also seek to establish the value of LFI testing on blood obtained from a capillary blood sample. METHODS: Samples collected by venous blood draw and finger stick were obtained from patients with SARS-CoV-2 detected by RT-qPCR and control patients. Samples were tested with Biolidics 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit lateral flow immunoassay, and antibody calls were compared with ELISA. RESULTS: Biolidics LFI showed clinical sensitivity of 92% with venous blood at 7 days after PCR diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Test specificity was 92% for IgM and 100% for IgG. There was no significant difference in detecting IgM and IgG with Biolidics LFI and ELISA at D0 and D7 (p = 1.00), except for detection of IgM at D7 (p = 0.04). Capillary blood of SARS-CoV-2 patients showed 93% sensitivity for antibody detection. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical performance of Biolidics 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM Detection Kit is comparable to ELISA and was consistent across sample types. This provides an opportunity for decentralized rapid testing and may allow point-of-care and longitudinal self-testing for the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Black, Margaret A.; Shen, Guomiao; Feng, Xiaojun; Garcia Beltran, Wilfredo F.; Feng, Yang; Vasudevaraja, Varshini; Allison, Douglas; Lin, Lawrence H.; Gindin, Tatyana; Astudillo, Michael; Yang, Diane; Murali, Mandakolathur; Iafrate, A.

This heterogeneous group of compounds contains many biopolymers with unique structure and biological properties that exhibit high anti-infective activity. In the present review, the authors focus on the antiviral potential of polyphenolic compounds (phlorotannins) from marine algae and consider the mechanisms of their action as well as other biological properties of these compounds that have effects on the progress and outcome of viral infections. Effective nutraceuticals, to be potentially developed on the basis of algal polyphenols, can also be used in the complex therapy of viral diseases.

Objective: To conduct a comprehensive systematic evaluation and meta-analysis of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children and adolescents to better guide the response to the current epidemic. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI (Chinese database), Clinical Trials.gov and chictr.org.cn (China). The methodological quality of the included literature was evaluated using the Quality Assessment Tool for Case Series Studies. Meta-analysis was performed using STATA 14.0. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Q statistic and quantified using I2. We used fixed-effects or random-effects models to pool clinical data in the meta-analysis. Publication bias was evaluated by the Begg's test. Results: We analyzed 49 studies involving 1627 patients. In the pooled data, the most common clinical symptoms were fever (56% [0.50-0.61]) and cough (45% [0.39-0.51]). The most common laboratory abnormalities were elevated procalcitonin (40% [0.23-0.57]), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (31% [0.19-0.43]), increased lymphocyte count (28% [0.17-0.42]), increased creatine kinase (28% [0.18- 0.40]), and elevated C-reactive protein (26% [0.17-0.36]). The most common abnormalities determined by computed tomography were lower-lobe involvement (56% [0.42- 0.70]), ground-glass opacities (33% [0.25-0.42]), bilateral pneumonia (32% [0.24- 0.40]), patchy shadowing (31% [0.18- 0.45]), and upper lobe involvement (30% [0.20- 0.41]). Conclusion: Disease severity among children and adolescents with COVID-19 was milder than that among adult patients, with a greater proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases, and thus, the diagnosis of COVID-19 and control of the infection source are more challenging.","Lou, L.; Zhang, H.; Tang, B.; Li, M.; Li, Z.; Cao, H.; Li, J.; Chong, Y.",,547,22

We applied single-cell RNA sequencing to 284 samples from 205 COVID-19 patients and controls to create a comprehensive immune landscape. Lymphopenia and active T and B cell responses were found to coexist and associated with age, sex and their interactions with COVID-19. Diverse epithelial and immune cell types were observed to be virus-positive and showed dramatic transcriptomic changes. Elevation of ANXA1 and S100A9 in virus-positive squamous epithelial cells may enable the initiation of neutrophil and macrophage responses via the ANXA1-FPR1 and S100A8/9-TLR4 axes. Systemic upregulation of S100A8/A9, mainly by megakaryocytes and monocytes in the peripheral blood, may contribute to the cytokine storms frequently observed in severe patients.

To eradicate SARS-CoV-2 and prevent further infections, many vaccine candidates have been developed. These vaccines include not only traditional subunit vaccines and attenuated or inactivated viral vaccines but also nucleic acid and viral vector vaccines. In contrast to the diversity in the platform technology, the delivery of vaccines is limited to intramuscular vaccination. Although intramuscular vaccination is safe and effective, mucosal vaccination could improve the local immune responses that block the spread of pathogens. However, a lack of understanding of mucosal immunity combined with the urgent need for a COVID-19 vaccine has resulted in only intramuscular vaccinations. In this review, we summarize the history of vaccines, current progress in COVID-19 vaccine technology, and the status of intranasal COVID-19 vaccines. Future research should determine the most effective route for vaccine delivery based on the platform and determine the mechanisms that underlie the efficacy of different delivery routes.","Park, Jang Hyun; Lee, Heung Kyu",Vaccines (Basel),547,1

However, the effectiveness of these test-and-travel strategies to reduce passenger risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and population-level transmission remains unknown. METHODS: In this simulation study, we developed a microsimulation of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a cohort of 100 000 US domestic airline travellers using publicly available data on COVID-19 clinical cases and published natural history parameters to assign individuals one of five health states of susceptible to infection, latent period, early infection, late infection, or recovered. We estimated a per-day risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 corresponding to a daily incidence of 150 infections per 100 000 people. We assessed five testing strategies: (1) anterior nasal PCR test within 3 days of departure, (2) PCR within 3 days of departure and 5 days after arrival, (3) rapid antigen test on the day of travel (assuming 90% of the sensitivity of PCR during active infection), (4) rapid antigen test on the day of travel and PCR test 5 days after arrival, and (5) PCR test 5 days after arrival. Strategies 2 and 4 included a 5-day quarantine after arrival. The travel period was defined as 3 days before travel to 2 weeks after travel. Under each scenario, individuals who tested positive before travel were not permitted to travel. The primary study outcome was cumulative number of infectious days in the cohort over the travel period without isolation or quarantine (population-level transmission risk), and the key secondary outcome was the number of infectious people detected on the day of travel (passenger risk of infection). FINDINGS: We estimated that in a cohort of 100 000 airline travellers, in a scenario with no testing or screening, there would be 8357 (95% uncertainty interval 6144–12831) infectious days with 649 (505–950) actively infectious passengers on the day of travel. The pre-travel PCR test reduced the number of infectious days from 8357 to 5401 (3917–8677), a reduction of 36% (29–41) compared with the base case, and identified 569 (88% [76–92]) of 649 actively infectious travellers on the day of flight; the addition of post-travel quarantine and PCR reduced the number of infectious days to 2520 days (1849–4158), a reduction of 70% (64–75) compared with the base case. The rapid antigen test on the day of travel reduced the number of infectious days to 5674 (4126–9081), a reduction of 32% (26–38) compared with the base case, and identified 560 (86% [83–89]) actively infectious travellers; the addition of post-travel quarantine and PCR reduced the number of infectious days to 3124 (2356–495), a reduction of 63% (58–66) compared with the base case. The post-travel PCR alone reduced the number of infectious days to 4851 (3714–7679), a reduction of 42% (35–49) compared with the base case. INTERPRETATION: Routine asymptomatic testing for SARS-CoV-2 before travel can be an effective strategy to reduce passenger risk of infection during travel, although abbreviated quarantine with post-travel testing is probably needed to reduce population-level transmission due to importation of infection when travelling from a high to low incidence setting.

Using pseudotyped lentivectors, we confirmed that the aspartate replacement by glycine in position 614 is markedly more infectious. Molecular modelling suggests that the G614 mutation facilitates transition towards an open state of the Spike protein. To explain the epidemiological success of D614G, we analysed the evolution of 27,086 high-quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from GISAID. We observed striking coevolution of D614G with the P323L mutation in the viral polymerase. Importantly, the exclusive presence of G614 or L323 did not become epidemiologically relevant. In contrast, the combination of the two mutations gave rise to a viral G/L variant that has all but replaced the initial D/P variant. Our results suggest that the P323L mutation, located in the interface domain of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is a necessary alteration that led to the epidemiological success of the present variant of SARS-CoV-2. However, we did not observe a significant correlation between reported COVID-19 mortality in different countries and the prevalence of the Wuhan versus G/L variant. Nevertheless, when comparing the speed of emergence and the ultimate predominance in individual countries, it is clear that the G/L variant displays major epidemiological supremacy over the original variant.","Ilmjärv, Sten; Abdul, Fabien; Acosta-Gutiérrez, Silvia; Estarellas, Carolina; Galdadas, Ioannis; Casimir, Marina; Alessandrini, Marco; Gervasio, Francesco Luigi; Krause, Karl-Heinz",Sci Rep,547,3

METHODS: We followed 2338 people in Managua, Nicaragua, aged <94 years from March 2020 through March 2021. SARS-CoV-2 infection was identified through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Disease presentation was assessed at the time of infection or retrospectively by survey at the time of blood collection. RESULTS: There was a large epidemic that peaked between March and August 2020. In total, 129 RT-PCR–positive infections were detected, for an overall incidence rate of 5.3 infections per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.4–6.3). Seroprevalence was 56.7% (95% CI, 53.5%–60.1%) and was consistent from age 11 through adulthood but was lower in children aged ≤10 years. Overall, 31.0% of the infections were symptomatic, with 54.7% mild, 41.6% moderate, and 3.7% severe. There were 2 deaths that were likely due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, yielding an infection fatality rate of 0.2%. Antibody titers exhibited a J-shaped curve with respect to age, with the lowest titers observed among older children and young adults and the highest among older adults. When compared to SARS-CoV-2–seronegative individuals, SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity at the midyear sample was associated with 93.6% protection from symptomatic reinfection (95% CI, 51.1%–99.2%). CONCLUSIONS: This population exhibited a very high SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity with lower-than-expected severity, and immunity from natural infection was protective against symptomatic reinfection.","Maier, Hannah E; Kuan, Guillermina; Saborio, Saira; Carrillo, Fausto Andres Bustos; Plazaola, Miguel; Barilla, Carlos; Sanchez, Nery; Lopez, Roger; Smith, Matt; Kubale, John; Ojeda, Sergio; Zuniga-Moya, Julio C; Carlson, Bradley; Lopez, Brenda; Gajewski, Anna M; Chowdhury, Mahboob; Harris, Eva; Balmaseda, Angel; Gordon, Aubree",Clin Infect Dis,547,5

STUDY DESIGN: A computerized search was conducted using PubMed. An article was considered eligible if it reported data on pediatric patient(s) with neurological involvement related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also described a case of an acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in a 5-year-old girl with SARS-CoV-2 infection: this case was also included in the systematic review. RESULTS: Forty-four articles reporting 59 cases of neurological manifestations in pediatric patients were included in our review. Most (32/59) cases occurred in the course of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Neurological disorders secondary to cerebrovascular involvement were reported in 10 cases: 4 children with an ischemic stroke, 3 with intracerebral hemorrhage, 1 with a cerebral sinus venous thrombosis, 1 with a subarachnoid hemorrhage, 1 with multiple diffuse microhemorrhages. Reversible splenial lesions were recognized in 9 cases, benign intracranial hypertension in 4 patients, meningoencephalitis in 4 cases, autoimmune encephalitis in 1 girl, cranial nerves impairment in 2 patients and transverse myelitis in 1 case. Five cases had Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and two, including ours, had ADEM. Radiological investigations were performed in almost all cases (45/60): the most recurrent radiological finding was a signal change in the splenium of the corpus callosum. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral nucleic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid was proved only in 2 cases. The outcome was favorable in almost all, except in 5 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our research highlights the large range of neurological manifestations and their presumed pathogenic pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. Nervous system involvement could be isolated, developing during COVID-19 or after its recovery, or arise in the context of a MIS-C. The most reported neurological manifestations are cerebrovascular accidents, reversible splenial lesions, GBS, benign intracranial hypertension, meningoencephalitis; ADEM is also a possible complication, as we observed in our patient. Further studies are required to investigate all the neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection and their underlying pathogenic mechanism.","Siracusa, L.; Cascio, A.; Giordano, S.; Medaglia, A.
