Such devices have the potential to play an important role as easy-to-handle tools in critical situations. Epidemic infectious disease agents (e.g., Ebola virus, Coronavirus, Zika virus) could be controlled more easily by testing travelers on-site at the country borders to prevent outbreaks from spreading. The increasing incidence of hospital-acquired infections caused by antibiotic resistant pathogens could be minimized by point-of-care microbial analysis as well as rapid screening tests of bacteria resistance. The threat of bioterrorism using novel unknown bioweapons has never been so high, thus, in-the-field early identification of the biological agent is crucial for triggering a coordinated response. Food allergies are a growing public health concern-allergic reactions can result in anaphylactic shock, which can prove fatal in minutes-thus, the ability to test foods for common allergens, rapidly and locally, before ingestion, would improve food safety for those with allergies. Lab-on-chip devices are becoming widely available for diverse applications and are becoming increasingly affordable. However, to shrink in price and size simultaneously, some trade-offs must be made. In this Perspective, we present considerations about product specifications, design concepts, and application scenarios.","Romao, Veronica C; Martins, Sofia A M; Germano, Jose; Cardoso, Filipe A; Cardoso, Susana; Freitas, Paulo P",ACS nano,896,1

The photonic crystal is prepared in porous silicon (pSi) by electrochemical anodization of single crystal silicon, and the porosity and the stop band of the material is engineered such that the integrated device visibly changes color (green to red or blue to green) when infiltrated with alcohol. Two types of self-reporting devices are prepared and their performance compared: the first type involves heat-assisted fusion of a freestanding pSi photonic crystal to the connector end of a preformed polycarbonate hub, forming a composite where the unfilled portion of the pSi film acts as the sensor; the second involves generation of an all-polymer replica of the pSi photonic crystal by complete thermal infiltration of the pSi film and subsequent chemical dissolution of the pSi portion. Both types of sensors visibly change color when wetted with alcohol, and the color reverts to the original upon evaporation of the liquid. The sensor performance is verified using E. coli-infected samples.","Kumeria, Tushar; Wang, Joanna; Chan, Nicole; Harris, Todd J; Sailor, Michael J",ACS sensors,896,32

OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy of flow-diverting stents in the treatment of small, unruptured aneurysms of the ACA. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our database of prospectively collected information for all patients treated with flow diversion for an unruptured saccular aneurysm of the ACA between September 2009 and July 2016. The aneurysm fundus size, neck size, number and type of flow-diverting stent (FDS), complications, and follow-up data were recorded. RESULTS In total 26 patients, with 27 aneurysms were identified that matched our inclusion criteria (11 male and 15 female). The average age of the patients was 59.3 years (range 27-77 years). All patients, except one, had a single aneurysm affecting the ACA. Fourteen aneurysms were located on the left (51.9%). The average aneurysm fundus size was 2.9 mm (range 2-6 mm). Twenty patients had follow-up angiographic studies. In total, 16 aneurysms were completely excluded, 1 aneurysm showed a very small remnant, and no follow-up angiographic data are available for the remaining patients. One patient had a treatment-related complication. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of aneurysms arising from the ACA with flow diverters is technically feasible and carries a high degree of success with low complication rate.","Bhogal, P; Martinez Moreno, R; Ganslandt, O; Bäzner, H; Henkes, H; Perez, M Aguilar",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,896,5

Whole countries and cities were isolated, public and private institutions ceased their activities, and the country's higher educational institutions were forced to stop full-time education and switch to distance learning. Thus, the purpose of this study was to compare the indicators of the mental state (depression, anxiety) of students during full-time and distance learning. The first study was carried out by us during the full-time study period (February 10-17, 2020, sample size n = 154), and the second study was conducted during the distance learning period (October 19-26, 2020, sample size n = 154). The study evaluated such indicators as satisfaction with academic performance, the severity of depressive symptoms and anxiety. The results obtained indicate that the prevalence of depressive symptoms and anxiety among students was significantly higher during the distance learning period compared to similar indicators obtained during the full-time study period. The results of this study indicate that a sudden shift from one learning regime to another was a causative factor in stressful stress, which led to a high prevalence of depressive symptoms and anxiety among undergraduate students. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.","Lyubetsky, N.; Bendersky, N.; Verina, T.; Demyanova, L.; Arkhipova, D.","14th International Scientific and Practical Conference on State and Prospects for theDevelopment of Agribusiness, INTERAGROMASH 2021",896,1

To locate determinants for sorting of gp210 to the pore membrane, we constructed various cDNAs coding for wild-type, mutant, and chimeric gp210, and monitored localization of the expressed protein in 3T3 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy using appropriate antibodies. The large cisternal domain of gp210 (95% of its mass) did not reveal any sorting determinants. Surprisingly, the TM of gp210 is sufficient for sorting to the pore membrane. The CT also contains a sorting determinant, but it is weaker than that of the TM. We propose specific lateral association of the transmembrane helices of two proteins to yield either a gp210 homodimer or a heterodimer of gp210 and another protein. The cytoplasmically oriented tails of these dimers may bind cooperatively to the adjacent NPCs.

ACE2 catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, thereby counterbalancing ACE activity. Accumulating evidence indicates that the enzymatic activity of ACE2 has a protective role in cardiovascular diseases. Loss of ACE2 can be detrimental, as it leads to functional deterioration of the heart and progression of cardiac, renal, and vascular pathologies. Recombinant soluble human ACE2 protein has been demonstrated to exhibit beneficial effects in various animal models, including cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is a multifunctional enzyme and thus potentially acts on other vasoactive peptides, such as Apelin, a vital regulator of blood pressure and myocardium contractility. In addition, ACE2 is structurally a chimeric protein that has emerged from the duplication of 2 genes: homology with ACE at the carboxypeptidase domain and homology with Collectrin in the transmembrane C-terminal domain. ACE2 has been implicated in the pathology of Hartnup's disease, a disorder of amino acid homeostasis, and, via its function in amino acid transport, it has been recently revealed that ACE2 controls intestinal inflammation and diarrhea, thus regulating the gut microbiome. This review summarizes and discusses the structure and multiple functions of ACE2 and the relevance of this key enzyme in disease pathogenesis.","Kuba, Keiji; Imai, Yumiko; Penninger, Josef M",Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,896,8

METHODS A deterministic mathematical model was designed to evaluate the dynamic interactions between mobility, sexual behaviour, HIV, and sexually transmitted infections. The model was based on a population study of 488 adults, which included male migrants, male non-migrants and their rural partners in KwaZulu/Natal, South Africa. RESULTS The model predicted that the impact of migration depends upon the epidemic's stage and the pattern of migration. Early in the epidemic, frequent migration between populations with different HIV prevalence rates accelerated HIV spread; however, local sexual risk behaviour determined the eventual scale of the epidemic. If migration is coupled with increased sexual risk behaviour by migrant men, as has been reported in the South African communities studied, HIV prevalence would increase 10 times among migrants' female partners (1.8 to 19%). In contrast, if migration were to occur infrequently, with migration-associated risk behaviour assumed to be at current levels, the predicted epidemic would be one fifth that currently observed (2.8 versus 15.1%). CONCLUSIONS Migration primarily influences HIV spread by increasing high-risk sexual behaviour, rather than by connecting areas of low and high risk. Frequent return of migrants is an important risk factor when coupled with increased sexual risk behaviour. Accordingly, intervention programmes in South Africa need to target the sexual behaviour of short-term migrants specifically, even though these individuals may be more difficult to identify.","Coffee, Megan; Lurie, Mark N; Garnett, Geoff P",AIDS,896,9

To date, the pandemic situation in all 55 African Union (AU) Member States has not been comprehensively reviewed. We aimed to evaluate reported COVID-19 epidemiology data to better understand the pandemic's progression in Africa. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional analysis between Feb 14 and Dec 31, 2020, using COVID-19 epidemiological, testing, and mitigation strategy data reported by AU Member States to assess trends and identify the response and mitigation efforts at the country, regional, and continent levels. We did descriptive analyses on the variables of interest including cumulative and weekly incidence rates, case fatality ratios (CFRs), tests per case ratios, growth rates, and public health and social measures in place. FINDINGS: As of Dec 31, 2020, African countries had reported 2 763 421 COVID-19 cases and 65 602 deaths, accounting for 3·4% of the 82 312 150 cases and 3·6% of the 1 798 994 deaths reported globally. Nine of the 55 countries accounted for more than 82·6% (2 283 613) of reported cases. 18 countries reported CFRs greater than the global CFR (2·2%). 17 countries reported test per case ratios less than the recommended ten to 30 tests per case ratio range. At the peak of the first wave in Africa in July, 2020, the mean daily number of new cases was 18 273. As of Dec 31, 2020, 40 (73%) countries had experienced or were experiencing their second wave of cases with the continent reporting a mean of 23 790 daily new cases for epidemiological week 53. 48 (96%) of 50 Member States had five or more stringent public health and social measures in place by April 15, 2020, but this number had decreased to 36 (72%) as of Dec 31, 2020, despite an increase in cases in the preceding month. INTERPRETATION: Our analysis showed that the African continent had a more severe second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic than the first, and highlights the importance of examining multiple epidemiological variables down to the regional and country levels over time. These country-specific and regional results informed the implementation of continent-wide initiatives and supported equitable distribution of supplies and technical assistance. Monitoring and analysis of these data over time are essential for continued situational awareness, especially as Member States attempt to balance controlling COVID-19 transmission with ensuring stable economies and livelihoods.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study with patients &#8805; 75 years of age who were eligible for fast-track, moderate surgery, without severe dementia, with a planned hospitalization of 24 h and with a physical status varying from very fit to vulnerable. The 4-item confusion assessment method (CAM4) was used to measure delirium. RESULTS: Of the 209 eligible patients, 195 subjects were enrolled in the study. The percentage of the population with a CAM4 score above 0 before surgery was 2.56%; after surgery, the percentage was 10.25%; and on the following day, the percentage was 4.61%. There was a statistically significant difference in the CAM4 scores between immediately after surgery and at 24 h after surgery (p = 0.0172). CONCLUSION: The data from this study support an enhanced recovery approach for elderly patients, in which after a minor surgical procedure with anaesthesia, a recovery period of one night in the hospital can contribute to normalizing the CAM4 score and reducing the incidence of delirium.","Melegari, Gabriele; Albertini, Giovanna; Romani, Andrea; Malaguti, Silvio; Traccitto, Francesca; Giuliani, Enrico; Cavallini, Gian Maria; Bertellini, Elisabetta; Barbieri, Alberto",Aging clin. exp. res,896,24

Review Manager 5.3 was used to analyze results of meta-analysis. Observational studies were analyzed for quality using the modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale and randomized clinical trials, using the Jadad scale. Subjects were divided into those with severe-only and other (severe and not severe) cohorts based on published criteria. Efficacy endpoints studied included mortality, hospitalization duration, rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, use of mechanical ventilation, and a composite endpoint (death, ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation). We included 11 reports including 10 cohort studies and 1 randomized clinical trial involving 5249 subjects (2003-2020). Two discussed the association of corticosteroids and virus clearing and 10 explored how corticosteroids impacted mortality, hospitalization duration, use of mechanical ventilation, and a composite endpoint. Corticosteroid use was associated with delayed virus clearing with a mean difference (MD) = 3.78 days (95% confidence Interval [CI] = 1.16, 6.41 days; I2 = 0%). There was no significant reduction in deaths with relative Risk Ratio (RR) = 1.07 (90% CI = 0.81; 1.42; I2 = 80%). Hospitalization duration was prolonged and use of mechanical ventilation increased. In conclusion, corticosteroid use in subjects with SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV infections delayed virus clearing and did not convincingly improve survival, reduce hospitalization duration or ICU admission rate and/or use of mechanical ventilation. There were several adverse effects. Because of a preponderance of observational studies in the dataset and selection and publication biases our conclusions, especially regarding SARS-CoV-2, need confirmation in a randomized clinical trial.
