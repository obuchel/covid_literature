The marks serve as sites for candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) that may serve functional roles in regulating gene expression(1). The project has been extended to model organisms, particularly the mouse. In the third phase of ENCODE, nearly a million and more than 300,000 cCRE annotations have been generated for human and mouse, respectively, and these have provided a valuable resource for the scientific community.","Snyder, Michael P.; Gingeras, Thomas R.; Moore, Jill E.; Weng, Zhiping; Gerstein, Mark B.; Ren, Bing; Hardison, Ross C.; Stamatoyannopoulos, John A.; Graveley, Brenton R.; Feingold, Elise A.; Pazin, Michael J.; Pagan, Michael; Gilchrist, Daniel A.; Hitz, Benjamin C.; Cherry, J.

There are signals that intensive interdisciplinary pain treatments (IIPT) may inadvertently improve objective sleep, but this claim cannot be substantiated without baseline sleep data prior to IIPT. This study followed the objective sleep/wake patterns (e.g., duration, quality, timing, consistency) of pediatric patients with severely functionally disabling chronic pain before, during, and after inpatient IIPT (the Functional Independence Restoration Program—“FIRST Program”), alongside a similarly-disabled chronic pain Comparison Group. The final sample included N = 10 FIRST Patients and N = 9 Comparison Group patients. At baseline, the whole sample showed healthy sleep duration (~9 h), average sleep efficiency <90%, late sleep onset and offset (mean = 11:56 p.m.–8:50 a.m.), and highly inconsistent sleep schedules night to night. During IIPT, FIRST Patients maintained healthy sleep durations, moved sleep schedules 2 h earlier, and decreased timing and duration variability by >60 min while the Comparison Group maintained similar sleep to baseline. At follow up (1–2 months later), FIRST Patients’ sleep schedules shifted later but were still less variable than at baseline. Results point to the malleability of sleep/wake patterns within treatment contexts with strict environmental control but suggest that these gains may be difficult for youth with chronic pain to maintain in the home environment.","Krietsch, Kendra N.; Beebe, Dean W.; King, Christopher; Homan, Kendra J.; Williams, Sara E.",Children (Basel),633,18

Often, such additional problems represent the major cause of disability, requiring their prioritization above the tic symptomatology. Here, we present six cases of children and adolescents with treatment-resistant Tourette syndrome aged 11–17 years, whose symptoms, especially the non-tic symptoms such as aggressive behavior and obsessive symptoms, failed to respond adequately to at least two different antipsychotics and, where deemed appropriate, to a combination with a medication with a different therapeutic indication or chemical class (e.g., antidepressant or anticonvulsant). Such symptomatic manifestations were significantly reduced by the time of the subsequent control visit planned 30 days later, by using lurasidone as an add-on therapy to risperidone or aripiprazole (all p ≤ 0.009). No significant neuromotor or metabolic side effects were reported in all cases in a follow-up period ranging from 4 months to 6 months, supporting the stability of the observed clinical improvement. While still investigational, the preliminary evidence presented here gives reason to hope that lurasidone could possibly be an effective option in Tourette syndrome, warranting further investigation of its potential benefits in neurodevelopmental conditions.","Colizzi, Marco; Bortoletto, Riccardo; Zoccante, Leonardo",Children (Basel),633,18

The authors also a propose a comprehensive control system for the additive manufacturing process to meet the needs of Industry 4.0. Depending on the intended use of the models, the quality control process is divided into three stages: data control, manufacturing control, and post-processing control. Research models were made from the following materials: RGD 720 photopolymer resin (PolyJet method), ABS M30 thermoplastic (FDM method), E-Partial photopolymer resin (DLP method), PLA thermoplastic (FFF method), and ABS thermoplastic (MEM method). The applied measuring tools had an accuracy of at least an order of magnitude higher than that of the manufacturing technologies used. The results show that the PolyJet method is the most accurate, and the MEM method is the least accurate. The findings also confirm that the selection of materials, 3D printing methods, and measurement methods should always account not only for the specificity and purpose of the model but also for economic aspects, as not all products require high accuracy and durability.","Budzik, Grzegorz; Woźniak, Joanna; Paszkiewicz, Andrzej; Przeszłowski, Łukasz; Dziubek, Tomasz; Dębski, Mariusz",Materials (Basel),633,18

Anticipatory Care Planning (ACP), through earlier identification of healthcare needs, is evidenced to improve quality of life, decrease aggressive interventions, and prolong life. With patient acceptability of growing importance in the design, implementation, and evaluation of healthcare interventions, this study reports on the acceptability of a primary care based ACP intervention on the island of Ireland. METHODS: As part of the evaluation of a feasibility cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT) testing an ACP intervention for older people at risk of functional decline, intervention participants [n = 34] were interviewed in their homes at 10-week follow-up to determine acceptability. The intervention consisted of home visits by specifically trained registered nurses who assessed participants’ health, discussed their health goals and plans, and devised an anticipatory care plan in collaboration with participants’ GPs and adjunct clinical pharmacist. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview data. The feasibility cRCT involved eight general practitioner (GP) practices as cluster sites, stratified by jurisdiction, four in Northern Ireland (NI) (two intervention, two control), and four in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) (two intervention, two control). Participants were assessed for risk of functional decline. A total of 34 patients received the intervention and 31 received usual care. FINDINGS: Thematic analysis resulted in five main themes: timing of intervention, understanding of ACP, personality & individual differences, loneliness & social isolation, and views on healthcare provision. These map across the Four Factor Model of Acceptability (‘4FMA’), a newly developed conceptual framework comprising four components: intervention factors, personal factors, social support factors, and healthcare provision factors. CONCLUSION: Acceptability of this primary care based ACP intervention was high, with nurses’ home visits, GP anchorage, multidisciplinary working, personalized approach, and active listening regarded as beneficial. Appropriate timing, and patient health education emerged as vital.","Corry, Dagmar A.

This study aims to explore the perceptions of healthcare providers and caregivers of children aged below five years to improve child health in urban Indonesia. A mixed-methods study design was adopted. Quantitative data were collected via questionnaires from the caregivers. Qualitative data were collected via semi-structured interviews from the healthcare providers. Analysis of 540 caregiver questionnaires regarding the care provided to their child revealed that the majority of them were very satisfied (46.1%) and satisfied (52.2%) with the care received. Analysis of 12 interviews with healthcare providers derived three major themes: (1) importance of one’s role as a healthcare provider; (2) factors affecting the delivery of healthcare; and (3) the way forward in caring for young children. Although caregivers were very satisfied with the care received for their children, the perception of healthcare providers regarding their responsibility in delivering care to children under five years old provides insights into improving the quality of services for children in Indonesia. Our findings suggest that mortality and morbidity of children aged below five years can be best reduced by optimizing primary and secondary preventive measures.","Setiawan, Agus; Fitriyani, Poppy; Istifada, Rizkiyani; Shorey, Shefaly",Int J Environ Res Public Health,633,18

Agricultural trade will be less significantly affected, being insulated by its relatively low income elasticities of demand. However, a drop in the range of 12 to 20 percent in real trade value should be expected. Canada can be expected to share in this, but, within agricultural exports, cereals will be least affected. This minimal expected impact to cereals stems from the risk of wheat export bans by Russia and Kazakhstan, due to the resulting increase in wheat prices. Livestock, pulses, and horticulture can be expected to face a larger decline in trade prospects and revenues. An equally large threat to falling incomes in our trade partners is their policy responses, particularly the potential increase in import restrictions.

Therefore, vaccine candidates have been developed that target these fimbriae and induce specific anti-fimbriae antibodies to block initial ETEC attachment. While this vaccine effectively protects against ETEC-associated post-weaning diarrhea (PWD), developing a broadly effective vaccine against initial ETEC attachment remains a challenging problem, owing to the immunological heterogeneity among these antigens. Here, we applied multi-epitope fusion antigen (MEFA) technology to construct a FaeG–FedF–FanC–FasA–Fim41a MEFA using the adhesive subunits of predominant fimbriae K88 and F18 as the backbone, which also integrated epitopes from adhesive subunits of the rare fimbriae K99, 987P, and F41; we then generated a MEFA computational model and tested the immunogenicity of this MEFA protein in immunized mice. We next evaluated the potential of the fimbriae-targeted MEFA as a vaccine candidate to effectively prevent PWD using in vitro assessment of its anti-fimbriae, antibody-directed inhibition of bacterial adherence. Computational modeling showed that all relevant epitopes were exposed on the MEFA surface and mice subcutaneously immunized with the MEFA protein developed IgG antibodies to all five fimbriae. Moreover, anti-fimbriae antibodies induced by the MEFA protein significantly inhibited the adhesion of K88+, F18+, K99+, 987P+, and F41+ ETEC strains to piglet small intestinal IPEC-1 and IPEC-J2 cell lines. Taken together, these results indicate that FaeG–FedF–FanC–FasA–Fim41a MEFA protein induced specific anti-fimbriae neutralizing antibodies against the five targeted fimbriae. Critically, these results show the potential of fimbriae-targeted MEFA and indicate their promise as a broad, effective vaccine against PWD.","Duan, Qiangde; Pang, Shengmei; Wu, Wenwen; Jiang, Boyu; Zhang, Weiping; Liu, Siguo; Wang, Xiaojun; Pan, Zhiming; Zhu, Guoqiang",Vet Res,633,1

RECENT FINDINGS: Social isolation and social support are key social determinants of health, which may have a bidirectional relationship with HIV-related stigma and ageism. Stigmatization may also result in health care providers not paying enough attention to the mental health and sexual health needs of older adults.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed and Embase till April 15, 2020, by combining the terms (COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2, Novel Coronavirus, 2019-nCov, Wuhan pneumonia) and (pregnancy, pregnant women, mother, fetus, neonate, newborn, infant). RESULTS We included 16 case series and 12 case reports describing a total of 223 pregnant women and 201 infants. Four newborns born to mothers affected by COVID-19 were reported to have laboratory-confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection within 48 hours after birth. However, Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction tests of the breast milk, placenta, amniotic fluids, and cord blood and maternal vaginal secretions were all negative for SARS-CoV-2 in the reported cases. Fetal death was reported in two cases, and 48 of 185 newborns (25.9%) were born prematurely. Infants born small for gestational age and low birth weight (< 2,500 g) accounted for 8.3% and 15.6% of reported cases, respectively. Birth asphyxia and respiratory distress syndrome were observed in 1.8% and 6.4% of neonates, respectively. There was one neonatal death due to intractable gastric bleeding among the SARS-CoV-2-negative infants. CONCLUSIONS Current evidence suggests that COVID-19 during pregnancy rarely affects fetal and neonatal mortality, but can be associated with adverse neonatal morbidities. Vertical transmission has not been observed in the majority of the reported cases. The infants born to mothers with COVID-19 are carefully monitored for accompanying complication, and quarantine of infected mothers is warranted.","Yoon, S H; Kang, J-M; Ahn, J G",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,633,1

METHODS To understand which containment measures altered disease dynamics, we estimated change points in COVID-19 dynamics from official Italian data. RESULTS We found an excellent correlation between nationwide lockdown and the epidemic peak in late March 2020. Surprisingly, we found a change point in mid-April, which did not correspond to national measures, but may be explained by regional interventions. Change points in regional COVID-19 dynamics correlated well with local distribution of free face masks and regional orders requiring their mandatory use. Regions with no specific interventions showed no change point during April.

Clinically useful biomarkers are measurable, improve diagnostic or prognostic performance, and ultimately aid clinicians in determining the initiation, duration, or magnitude of therapy. Areas Covered The purpose of this review is to explore the roles of various blood biomarkers of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and how their use may improve the precision with which clinicians can identify, treat, and ultimately prevent ASCVD. Our review will include lipid biomarkers, markers of cardiac injury and wall stress, markers of inflammation, and a few others. Expert Opinion Several biomarkers have recently been highlighted as ""risk-enhancing factors"" in the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline for the Primary Prevention of ASCVD, which can help guide shared decision-making. These included elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein B, or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. However, some other biomarkers mentioned in this review are not commonly used despite showing initial promise as prognostic of ASCVD risk, as it is not clear how treatment decisions should be changed after their measurement among asymptomatic individuals. Future studies should focus on whether biomarker-directed management strategies can improve clinical outcomes.","Sweeney, Ty; Quispe, Renato; Das, Thomas; Juraschek, Stephen P; Martin, Seth S; Michos, Erin D",Expert review of precision medicine and drug development,633,1

Kinetic analysis of internucleosomal DNA cleavage by agarose gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry or cytometric monitoring of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential showed that, for ST cells infected with TGEV, the first overt signs of apoptosis appeared from 10 to 12 h postinfection on. They preceded morphological changes characteristic of cells undergoing apoptosis, as observed by light and electron microscopy. The tripeptide pan-ICE (caspase) inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone blocked TGEV-induced apoptosis with no effect on virus production. The thiol agent pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate inhibited apoptosis, suggesting that TGEV infection may lead to apoptosis via cellular oxidative stress. The effect of TGEV infection on activation of NF-kappaB, a transcription factor known to be activated by oxidative stress, was examined. NF-kappaB DNA binding was shown to be strongly and quickly induced by TGEV infection.

OBJECTIVE To identify whether there are amino-acid residues common to the epitopes of the known enhancing human monoclonal antibodies (MAb), and to provide a structural model for this functional region present on the HIV envelope. Since our model predicts that this region is involved in the association of gp120 with gp41, this association was monitored for each mutant. DESIGN The binding of enhancing human MAb to point and deletion mutations within the enhancing domain was analyzed by two methods. The first analyzed binding to mutants expressed in COS cells: the second quantified the binding of four enhancing human MAb to each mutant gp160 versus wild-type control by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). METHODS Site-directed mutagenesis was used to produce specific deletions and point mutants, which were expressed in COS cells. Binding of MAb 50-69 and V3-loop MAb 5F7 were visualized in the wild-type and each of the mutant constructs by immunohistochemistry. Quantitative evaluation of enhancing human MAb binding to each mutant versus wild-type was performed by ELISA. A model for the enhancing domain and its relationship to gp120 association with gp41 was provided by molecular dynamics and ligand docking methods. RESULTS All available enhancing human MAb known to bind to the principal immunodominant region of gp41 were unable to bind to deletions involving the disulfide loop, which in our molecular model provided the primary association site between gp120 and gp41. Point mutations in the loop blocked this association, but had a quantitatively smaller effect on the binding of the enhancing human MAb. A conservative W596Y mutation completely blocked the binding of all human MAb, but had no effect on gp120-gp41 association. CONCLUSIONS A variety of mutations within the primary C'-ADE domain inhibit binding of enhancing human MAb as well as blocking the association of gp120 and gp41. A conservative W596Y mutation blocks binding of all enhancing human MAb with retention of gp120-gp41 association. These data are important to the design of vaccines in which the primary enhancing epitope is disarmed to prevent the subsequent induction of an amnestic response that could lead to viral enhancement of infection. The retention of the gp120-gp41 association is postulated to yield an immunogen similar to natural infection for both subunit and genetic vaccines.","Mitchell, W M; Ding, L; Gabriel, J",AIDS,633,18

The peculiarity of modern conflicts is their transition from the regional and local levels to the global one. To the traditional interethnic and religious conflicts are added new ones related to the struggle for regional leadership and the radicalization of fundamentalist Islamic currents. This trend is particularly dangerous for the region in question, and the risks of its implementation are growing. The intervention of international powers (USA, EU countries, China, Russia, etc.), despite the declared stabilization intentions, in practice leads to further aggravation of the situation in the region. The build-up of Russian forces in the Black Sea has created a base for Russia's operations in the southern Mediterranean and the Middle East, as well as in the Balkans. Ukraine is reachable for challenges and risks arising from the Middle East. In the context of the Russian occupation of Crimea and the protracted Russo-Ukrainian war (2014 - present), this factor is becoming particularly dangerous. There is a need to outline the key regional and global trends that operate in the MENA area. Semantic dimension of conflicts so as value systems collision are interpreted as factors of socio-political instability, which are equal in terms of the impact to political, military, economic factors. © 2020 B.

Chest radiography (CXR) is routinely obtained at admission of COVID-19 patients. However, little is known regarding correlates between CXR severity and time to intubation. We hypothesize that the degree of opacification on CXR at time of admission independently predicts need and time to intubation. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to an urban medical center during March 2020 that had a CXR performed on the day of admission. CXRs were divided into 12 lung zones and were assessed by two blinded thoracic radiologists. A COVID-19 opacification rating score (CORS) was generated by assigning one point for each lung zone in which an opacity was observed. Underlying comorbidities were abstracted and assessed for association. RESULTS: One hundred forty patients were included in this study and 47 (34%) patients required intubation during the admission. Patients with CORS &#8805; 6 demonstrated significantly higher rates of early intubation within 48 h of admission and during the hospital stay (ORs 24 h, 19.8, p < 0.001; 48 h, 28.1, p < 0.001; intubation during hospital stay, 6.1, p < 0.0001). There was no significant correlation between CORS &#8805; 6 and age, sex, BMI, or any underlying cardiac or pulmonary comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: CORS &#8805; 6 at the time of admission predicts need for intubation, with significant increases in intubation at 24 and 48 h, independent of comorbidities. KEY POINTS: â¢ Chest radiography at the time of admission independently predicts time to intubation within 48 h and during the hospital stay in COVID-19 patients. â¢ More opacities on chest radiography are associated with several fold increases in early mechanical ventilation among COVID-19 patients. â¢ Chest radiography is useful in identifying COVID-19 patients whom may rapidly deteriorate and help inform clinical management as well as hospital bed and ventilation allocation.","Xiao, Nicholas; Cooper, John G; Godbe, Jacqueline M; Bechel, Meagan A; Scott, Michael B; Nguyen, Edward; McCarthy, Danielle M; Abboud, Samir; Allen, Bradley D; Parekh, Nishant D",Eur. radiol,633,16

METHODS: Using a structured strategy, the PubMed and Ovid:Embase databases were queried for articles about the clinical presentation and pathophysiology of coronavirus infections in the nervous system of children and young adults, aged 0 to 24 years. RESULTS: Of 2302 articles reviewed, 31 described SARS-CoV-2 infections in the nervous system of children and 21 described other human coronaviruses: HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1. Excepting MERS-CoV, we found cases of neurological disease in children from each human coronavirus. Children with non-SARS-CoV-2 infections have suffered acute flaccid paralysis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, encephalitis, and seizures. In addition, cases of ischemic, hemorrhagic, and microvascular strokes have occurred in children with SARS-CoV-2. Patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children have suffered encephalitis, stroke, pseudotumor cerebri syndrome, and cytotoxic lesions of deep brain structures. Despite these reports, few articles evaluated the impact of human coronavirus infections on long-term neurodevelopmental domains including cognitive, language, academic, motor, and psychosocial outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological manifestations of human coronavirus infections can cause severe disease in children. The case literature suggests a critical gap in knowledge of the long-term effects on child neurodevelopment of these infections. As the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues, this gap must be filled to facilitate optimal outcomes in recovering children.","Singer, Timothy G; Evankovich, Karen D; Fisher, Kristen; Demmler-Harrison, Gail J; Risen, Sarah R",Pediatr Neurol,633,17

We hypothesized that trimeric Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) proteins would be suitable candidates to study receptor binding properties of SARS-CoV-1 and -2. Here we created monomeric and trimeric fluorescent RBD proteins, derived from adherent HEK293T, as well as in GnTI-/- mutant cells, to analyze the effect of complex vs high mannose glycosylation on receptor binding. The results demonstrate that trimeric, complex glycosylated proteins are superior in receptor binding compared to monomeric and immaturely glycosylated variants. Although differences in binding to commonly used cell lines were minimal between the different RBD preparations, substantial differences were observed when respiratory tissues of experimental animals were stained. The RBD trimers demonstrated distinct ACE2 expression profiles in bronchiolar ducts and confirmed the higher binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 over SARS-CoV-1. Our results show that complex glycosylated trimeric RBD proteins are attractive to analyze sarbecovirus receptor binding and explore ACE2 expression profiles in tissues.","Bouwman, Kim M; Tomris, Ilhan; Turner, Hannah L; van der Woude, Roosmarijn; Shamorkina, Tatiana M; Bosman, Gerlof P; Rockx, Barry; Herfst, Sander; Snijder, Joost; Haagmans, Bart L; Ward, Andrew B; Boons, Geert-Jan; de Vries, Robert P",PLoS Pathog,633,6

Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 has accumulated around two mutations per genome each month. The first relevant event in this context was the occurrence of the mutant D614G in the Spike gene. Moreover, several variants have emerged, including the well-characterized 20I/501Y.V1, 20H/501Y.V2, and 20J/501Y.V3 strains, in addition to those that have been detected within clusters, such as 19B/501Y or 20C/655Y in France. Mutants have also emerged in animals, including a variant transmitted to humans, namely, the Mink variant detected in Denmark. The emergence of these variants has affected the transmissibility of the virus (for example, 20I/501Y.V1, which was up to 82% more transmissible than other preexisting variants), its severity, and its ability to escape natural, adaptive, vaccine, and therapeutic immunity. In this respect, we review the literature on variants that have currently emerged, and their effect on vaccines and therapies, and, in particular, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants must be examined to allow effective preventive and curative control strategies to be developed.","Chaqroun, Ahlam; Hartard, Cédric; Schvoerer, Evelyne",Viruses,633,16

This strategy is robust to common perturbations and is more flexible and stable than reopening of schools.

In this paper, we aim to improve the generalization ability of DR models from source training domains with rich supervision signals to target domains without any relevant labels, in the zero-shot setting. To achieve that, we propose Momentum adversarial Domain Invariant Representation learning (MoDIR), which introduces a momentum method in the DR training process to train a domain classifier distinguishing source versus target, and then adversarially updates the DR encoder to learn domain invariant representations. Our experiments show that MoDIR robustly outperforms its baselines on 10+ ranking datasets from the BEIR benchmark in the zero-shot setup, with more than 10% relative gains on datasets with enough sensitivity for DR models' evaluation.

Compounding this problem is the post-viral lung sequela that may be expected after COVID-19 pneumonia, similar to both SARS and MERS. Although chest imaging may play a role in the diagnosis of primary SARS-CoV-2 infection, reinfection or relapse of COVID-19 will have similar imaging findings. A ""new-baseline"" imaging can be obtained from COVID-19 patients at the time of hospital discharge or clinical recovery. This new reference can not only determine if readmissions are from relapse or reinfection of COVID-19, resolving COVID-19 or potentially a different viral infection (influenza), but also for long term sequela of COVID-19 lung infection. Strategic use of imaging before discharge may be helpful in the subset of the population at the highest risk of a secondary viral infection such as influenza.

Based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), the current study analyzes attitudes toward mask-purchasing, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, to assess their impact on intention to purchase masks. In total, six variables are examined: attitude toward mask-wearing, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, and the intention to wear masks. Data are collected from 243 respondents in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. They were processed through by factor analysis and multiple regressions. The results report that all three factors positively affect citizens' intention to buy masks in the following ascending order: Attitude toward mask-purchasing, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. Our study is the first research that applies TPB to investigate citizens' intention to purchase masks to during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Long term outcomes are unknown. This study aims to investigate recovery of loss of smell and the prevalence of parosmia. METHODOLOGY: 6-month follow-up of respondents to an online surgery who self-reported loss of smell at the onset of the CO- VID-19 pandemic in the UK. Information of additional symptoms, recovery of loss of smell and the development of parosmia was collected. RESULTS: 44% of respondents reported at least one other ongoing symptom at 6 months, of which fatigue (n=106) was the most prevalent. There was a significant improvement in self-rating of severity of olfactory loss where 177 patients stated they had a normal smell of smell while 12 patients reported complete loss of smell. The prevalence of parosmia is 43.1% with median interval of 2.5 months (range 0-6) from the onset of loss of smell. CONCLUSIONS: While many patients recover quickly, some experience long-term deficits with no self-reported improvement at 6 months. Furthermore, there is a high prevalence of parosmia even in those who report at least some recovery of olfactory func- tion. Longer term evaluation of recovery is required.","Hopkins, C; Surda, P; Vaira, L A; Lechien, J R; Safarian, M; Saussez, S; Kumar, N",Rhinology,633,1

Initial data suggest that overall, pregnancy is not a significant risk factor for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, case series have suggested that maternal obesity is one of the most important comorbidities associated with more severe disease. In obese individuals, suppressors of cytokine signaling are upregulated and type I and III interferon responses are delayed and blunted leading to ineffective viral clearance. Obesity is also associated with changes in systemic immunity involving a wide range of immune cells and mechanisms that lead to low-grade chronic inflammation, which can compromise antiviral immunity. Macrophage activation in adipose tissue can produce low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß, IL-6). Further, adipocyte secretion of leptin is pro-inflammatory and high circulating levels of leptin have been associated with mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. The synergistic effects of obesity-associated delays in immune control of COVID-19 with mechanical stress of increased adipose tissue may contribute to a greater risk of pulmonary compromise in obese pregnant women. In this review, we bring together data regarding obesity as a key co-morbidity for COVID-19 in pregnancy with known changes in the antiviral immune response associated with obesity. We also describe how the global burden of obesity among reproductive age women has serious public health implications for COVID-19.","McCartney, Stephen A; Kachikis, Alisa; Huebner, Emily M; Walker, Christie L; Chandrasekaran, Suchi; Adams Waldorf, Kristina M",Am J Reprod Immunol,633,1

Hypertension and respiratory inflammation are exacerbated by the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), which normally protects from rapidly dropping blood pressure via Angiotensin II (Ang II) produced by the enzyme Ace. The Ace paralog Ace2 degrades Ang II, counteracting its chronic effects, and serves as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Ace, the coronavirus, and COVID-19 comorbidities all regulate Ace2, but we do not yet understand how. To exploit zebrafish (Danio rerio) to help understand the relationship of the RAAS to COVID-19, we must identify zebrafish orthologs and co-orthologs of human RAAS genes and understand their expression patterns. To achieve these goals, we conducted genomic and phylogenetic analyses and investigated single cell transcriptomes. Results showed that most human RAAS genes have one or more zebrafish orthologs or co-orthologs. Results identified a specific type of enterocyte as the specific site of expression of zebrafish orthologs of key RAAS components, including Ace, Ace2, Slc6a19 (SARS-CoV-2 co-receptor), and the Angiotensin-related peptide cleaving enzymes Anpep (receptor for the common cold coronavirus HCoV-229E), and Dpp4 (receptor for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus, MERS-CoV). Results identified specific vascular cell subtypes expressing Ang II receptors, apelin, and apelin receptor genes. These results identify genes and cell types to exploit zebrafish as a disease model for understanding mechanisms of COVID-19.","Postlethwait, John H; Massaquoi, Michelle S; Farnsworth, Dylan R; Yan, Yi-Lin; Guillemin, Karen; Miller, Adam C",,633,18

Without an integrated view leading to socially robust orientations, we are less likely to successfully navigate our challenging times. However, COVID19 became a ""wicked problem"", in which there is broad disagreement on what the very 'problem' is, and instead of a ""wholeofgovernment, wholeofsociety approach"", we find partial solutions that fall short of dealing with the complex dilemmas posed by the wicked problem. To build an integrated view, different scientists and social actors should engage in trust relationships and accept mutual epistemic dependencies, as requisites for a concerted way of understanding and acting on the problem. This is particularly hard, however, in a wicked problem. In building an integrated view on COVID19, the role of academic sciences should be surely recognized, but we should avoid turning this recognition into an advocacy for scientism. It remains necessary to recognize and value the plurality of knowledge systems that span over human history, as well as their integration for mutual learning and concerted action. It is worth briefly examining, then, an integration initiative in COVID19 treatment, namely between traditional Chinese and Western medicine. Finally, an integrated and critical view of COVID19 demands that we cast aside the myth of valuefree science, consider the relationships between values and scientific work, and conceive how knowledge can be objective without being neutral.","El-Hani, Charbel N.; Machado, Virgílio",Ethnobiol.

The number of affected pregnant women is increasing, but scarce information is available about the clinical features of COVID-19 in pregnancy. This study aimed to clarify the clinical features and obstetric and neonatal outcomes of pregnant patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre study, we included all pregnant women with COVID-19 who were admitted to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. Clinical features, treatments, and maternal and fetal outcomes were assessed. FINDINGS: Seven patients, admitted to Tongji Hospital from Jan 1, to Feb 8, 2020, were included in our study. The mean age of the patients was 32 years (range 29-34 years) and the mean gestational age was 39 weeks plus 1 day (range 37 weeks to 41 weeks plus 2 days). Clinical manifestations were fever (six [86%] patients), cough (one [14%] patient), shortness of breath (one [14%] patient), and diarrhoea (one [14%] patient). All the patients had caesarean section within 3 days of clinical presentation with an average gestational age of 39 weeks plus 2 days. The final date of follow-up was Feb 12, 2020. The outcomes of the pregnant women and neonates were good. Three neonates were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and one neonate was infected with SARS-CoV-2 36 h after birth. INTERPRETATION: The maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes of patients who were infected in late pregnancy appeared very good, and these outcomes were achieved with intensive, active management that might be the best practice in the absence of more robust data. The clinical characteristics of these patients with COVID-19 during pregnancy were similar to those of non-pregnant adults with COVID-19 that have been reported in the literature.

We hypothesized differences in routine biochemistry and haematology indices in Caucasian and a combined group of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) patients who tested positive for COVID-19 who died, compared to survivors. METHODS: We tested our hypothesis in 445 patients (229 Caucasian, 216 BAME) admitted to secondary care with proven COVID-19 infection, in whom standard routine laboratory indices were collected on admission. RESULTS: After 28 weeks, 190 (42.7%) had died within 28 days of COVID diagnosis (97 Caucasians [42.4%], 93 BAMEs [43.1%], P = .923). A general linear model analysis found the ethnicity interaction with mortality to be significant for fibrinogen, ferritin and HbA1 c (after controlling for age). In a multivariate analysis, a neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio > 7.4 and a urea/albumin ratio > 0.28 increased the odds of death for both the Caucasian and the BAME group. Additional factors increasing the odds ratio in the BAME group included age >60 years and being diabetic. CONCLUSION: Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and urea/albumin ratio are simple metrics that predict death to aid clinicians in determining the prognosis of COVID-19 and help provide early intensive intervention to reduce mortality. In the BAME groups, intensive monitoring even at younger age and those with diabetes may also help reduce COVID-19 associated mortality.","Marwah, Mandeep; Marwah, Sukhjinder; Blann, Andrew; Morrissey, Hana; Ball, Patrick; Wandroo, Farooq A",Int. j. lab. hematol,633,13

METHODS: An online non-probability sample survey was used to assess psychological distress symptoms and burnout among perinatal healthcare professionals (PHPs) during the pandemic in Italy. The questionnaire included the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Demographic and occupational factors associated with stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms were analyzed. RESULTS: The sample size was 195. The estimated self-reported rates of moderate to severe anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms, and perceived stress levels were 18.7, 18.7, and 21.5%, respectively. Furthermore, 6.2% of respondents reported burnout.

This report provides updated information about symptomatic women of reproductive age (15-44 years) with laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. During January 22-October 3, CDC received reports through national COVID-19 case surveillance or through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) of 1,300,938 women aged 15-44 years with laboratory results indicative of acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. Data on pregnancy status were available for 461,825 (35.5%) women with laboratory-confirmed infection, 409,462 (88.7%) of whom were symptomatic. Among symptomatic women, 23,434 (5.7%) were reported to be pregnant. After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions, pregnant women were significantly more likely than were nonpregnant women to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) (10.5 versus 3.9 per 1,000 cases; adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.6-3.4), receive invasive ventilation (2.9 versus 1.1 per 1,000 cases; aRR = 2.9; 95% CI = 2.2-3.8), receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (0.7 versus 0.3 per 1,000 cases; aRR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.5-4.0), and die (1.5 versus 1.2 per 1,000 cases; aRR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.2-2.4). Stratifying these analyses by age and race/ethnicity highlighted disparities in risk by subgroup. Although the absolute risks for severe outcomes for women were low, pregnant women were at increased risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness. To reduce the risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19, pregnant women should be counseled about the importance of seeking prompt medical care if they have symptoms and measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection should be strongly emphasized for pregnant women and their families during all medical encounters, including prenatal care visits. Understanding COVID-19-associated risks among pregnant women is important for prevention counseling and clinical care and treatment.","Zambrano, Laura D; Ellington, Sascha; Strid, Penelope; Galang, Romeo R; Oduyebo, Titilope; Tong, Van T; Woodworth, Kate R; Nahabedian, John F; Azziz-Baumgartner, Eduardo; Gilboa, Suzanne M; Meaney-Delman, Dana",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,633,16

Using the Vizient clinical databases, we analyzed inpatient hospital discharges from the general medicine service and its subspecialty services including cardiology, neonatology, pulmonary/critical care, oncology, psychiatry, and neurology between December 2019 and July 2020. We compared baseline discharge data to that of the first few months of the pandemic, from February to July, 2020. We set the baseline as discharges by specialty from February 2019 through January 2020, averaged over 12 months. Compared to baseline, by April 2020 the volume of general medicine hospital discharge was reduced by -20.2%, from 235,581 to 188,027 discharges. We found that while overall the number of discharges decreased from baseline, with a nadir in March, pulmonary/critical care services had an increase in hospital discharge volume throughout the pandemic, from 7,534 at baseline to 15,792 discharges in April. These findings are important for understanding healthcare utilization during the pandemic and ensuring proper allocation of resources and funding throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chinn, Justine; Nguyen, Ninh T; Ramirez, Andrew; Hohmann, Samuel; Amin, Alpesh",,633,5

SARS-CoV &MERS-CoV are painstaking, extremely pathogenic. Also, very evidently, both have been communicated from bats to palm-civets & dromedary camels and further transferred ultimately to humans. No country has been deprived of this viral genomic contamination wherever populaces reside and are interconnected. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of this viral genome. The analysis aids the study of the outbreak of this Virus towards the other parts of the continent and the world. The parameters such as population mobility, natural history, epidemiological characteristics, and the transmission mechanism towards viral spread when considered into crowd dynamism result in improved estimation. This article studies the impact of time on the amount of susceptible, exposed, the infected person taking into account asymptomatic and symptomatic ones; recovered i.e., removed from this model and the virus particles existing in the open surfaces. The transition from stable phase to attractor phase happens after 13 days i.e.; it takes nearly a fortnight for the spread to randomize among people. Further, the pandemic transmission remains in the attractor phase for a very long time if no control measures are taken up. The attractor-source phase continues up to 385 days i.e., more than a year, and perhaps stabilizes on 386th day as per the Lyapunov exponent's analysis. The time series helps to know the period of the Virus's survival in the open sources i.e. markets, open spaces and various other carriers of the Virus if not quarantined or sanitized. The Virus cease to exist in around 60 days if it does not find any carrier or infect more places, people etc. The changes in LCEs of all variables as time progresses for around 400 days have been forecasted. It can be observed that phase trajectories indicate how the two variables interact with each other and affect the overall system's dynamics. It has been observed that for exposed and asymptomatically infected (y-z), as exposed ones (y) change from 0 to 100 the value of asymptomatically infected (z) increased upto around 58, at exposed ones (y)=100, asymptomatically infected (z) has two values as 58 and 10 i.e. follows bifurcation and as exposed ones (y) changes values upto 180, the value of asymptomatically infected (z) decreases to 25 so for exposed ones (y) from 100 to 180, asymptomatically infected (z) varies from 58 to 25 to 10 follows bifurcation. Also, phase structures of exposed-symptomatically infected (y-u), exposed-removed (y-v), exposed-virus in the reservoir (y-w), asymptomatically infected-removed (z-v), symptomatically infected-removed (u-v) specifically depict bifurcations in various forms at different points. In case of asymptomatically infected-virus in the reservoir (z-w), at asymptomatically infected (z)=10, the value of viruses in the reservoir (w)=50, then as asymptomatically infected (z) increases to upto around 60. At this point, removed ones (v) increase from 50 to 70 and asymptomatically infected (z) decrease to 20 i.e., crosses the same value twice, which shows its limiting is known as limit cycle behavior and both the values tend to decrease towards zero. It shows a closed-loop limit cycle. Today, there has been no scientific revolution in the development of vaccination, nor has any antiviral treatment been successful, resulting in lack of its medication. Based on the phases, time series, and complexity analysis of the model's various parameters, it is studied to understand the variation in this pandemic's scenario.","Sharma, Sunil Kumar; Bangia, Aashima; Alshehri, Mohammed; Bhardwaj, Rashmi",J Infect Public Health,633,16

Various elements have however not yet been uncovered as shown, for example, in the uncertainty on immune system responses to COVID-19. Fungal beta-glucans are bioactive molecules with immunomodulating properties. Insights into the effects and function of beta-glucans, which have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries, advances with the help of modern immunological and biotechnological methods. However, it is still unclear into which area beta-glucans fit best: supplements or medicine? This review has highlighted the potential application of fungal beta-glucans in nutrition and medicine, reviewing their formulation, efficacy, safety profile, and immunomodulating effects. The current status of dietary fungal glucans with respect to the European scientific requirements for health claims related to the immune system and defense against pathogens has been reviewed. Comparing the evidence base of the putative health effects of fungal beta-glucan supplements with the published guidance documents by EFSA on substantiating immune stimulation and pathogen defense by food products shows that fungal beta-glucans could play a role in supporting and maintaining health and, thus, can be seen as a good health-promoting substance from food, which could mean that this effect may also be claimed if approved. In addition to these developments related to food uses of beta-glucan-containing supplements, beta-glucans could also hold a novel position in Western medicine as the concept of trained immunity is relatively new and has not been investigated to a large extent. These innovative concepts, together with the emerging success of modern immunological and biotechnological methods, suggest that fungal glucans may play a promising role in both perspectives, and that there are possibilities for traditional medicine to provide an immunological application in both medicine and nutrition.","van Steenwijk, Hidde P; Bast, Aalt; de Boer, Alie",Nutrients,633,26

At present, the Covid-19 testing is costly and time-consuming. Chest X-Ray (CXR) testing can be the fastest, scalable, and non-invasive method. The existing methods suffer due to the limited CXR samples available from Covid-19.

The proposed method learns the robust and discriminative features with the help of contrastive loss. Moreover, the proposed method gives more importance to the infected regions as guided by the attention mechanism. We compute the sensitivity of the proposed method over the publicly available Covid-19 dataset. It is observed that the proposed AC-CovidNet exhibits very promising performance as compared to the existing methods even with limited training data.

As a result of high mortality rate among the severe COVID-19 patients, the early detection of the disease stage and early effective interventions are very important in reducing mortality. Hence, it is important to differentiate severe and non-severe cases from each other. To date, there are no proven diagnostic or prognostic parameters that can be used in this manner. Due to the expensive and not easily accessible tests that are performed for COVID-19, researchers are investigating some parameters that can be easily used. In some recent studies, hematological parameters have been evaluated to see if they can be used as predictive parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the current study, almost all hematological parameters were used, including the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio, monocyte/lymphocyte ratio, mean platelet volume to lymphocyte ratio, mean platelet volume to platelet ratio, plateletcrit, and D-dimer/fibrinogen ratio (DFR), neutrophil/lymphocyte/platelet scoring system, and systemic immune-inflammation index. A total of 750 patients, who were admitted to Ankara City Hospital due to COVID-19, were evaluated in this study. The patients were classified into 2 groups according to their diagnosis (confirmed or probable) and into 2 groups according to the stage of the disease (non-severe or severe). RESULTS: The values of the combinations of inflammatory markers and other hematological parameters in all of the patients with severe COVID-19 were calculated, and the predicted values of these parameters were compared. According to results of the study, nearly all of the hematological parameters could be used as potential diagnostic biomarkers for subsequent analysis, because the area under the curve (AUC) was higher than 0.50, especially for the DFR and NLR, which had the highest AUC among the parameters. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that, the parameters those enhanced from complete blood count, which is a simple laboratory test, can help to identify and classify COVID-19 patients into non-severe to severe groups.","San, Ishak; GemcIoGlu, EmIn; DavutoGlu, Mehmet; ÇatalbaS, RamIs; KarabuGa, Berkan; Kaptan, Enes; Erden, Abdulsamet; KÜÇÜkSahIn, Orhan; AteS, Ihsan; KaraahmetoGlu, Selma; HasanoGlu, Imran; Inan, Osman; Ünal, BÜSra Nur; ErdemIr, Ecem; Kahraman, FatIh Ahmet; GÜner, HatIce Rahmet",Turkish journal of medical sciences,633,28

If we are to learn one economic lesson from the pandemic, arguably it is the perils of an overfocus on short-term allocative efficiency at the price of lack of capacity to deal with uncertain future challenges. In normal times, building spare capacity with 'option value' into health systems may seem inefficient, the costs potentially exceeding the benefits. Yet the fatal weakness of not doing so is that this can leave health systems highly constrained when dealing with unexpected, but ultimately inevitable, shocks-such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we argue that the pandemic has highlighted the potentially enormous option value of biomedical research infrastructure. We illustrate this with reference to COVID-19 response work supported by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre. As the world deals with the fallout from the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression, pressure will soon come to review government expenditure, including research funding.

The RBD plays a critical role in the very first step of the virus life cycle. Better understanding of where and how nAbs bind the RBD should enable identification of sites of vulnerability and facilitate better vaccine design and formulation of immunotherapeutics. Towards this goal, we compiled 38 RBD-binding nAbs with known structures. Review of these nAb structures showed that (1) nAbs can be divided into five general clusters, (2) there are distinct non-neutralizing faces on the RBD, and (3) maximum of potentially four nAbs could bind the RBD simultaneously. Since most of these nAbs were isolated from virus-infected patients, additional analyses of vaccine-induced nAbs could facilitate development of improved vaccines.","Niu, Ling; Wittrock, Kathryn N; Clabaugh, Gage C; Srivastava, Vikram; Cho, Michael W",Front Immunol,633,16

However, the regulatory framework and authorization of these candidates is the most significant aspect of the whole scenario, which needs a specific set of time for validation purposes. The present work is widely focused on the general aspects of COVID-19 and the regulatory landscape for the emergency authorization of repurposed drug candidates, compassionate use of drugs, investigational entities, and vaccine development worldwide.

This has resulted in an urgent need to obtain information regarding its pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical manifestations. More specifically, skin manifestations, seldom reported initially, have been increasingly described. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a literature search in the PubMed database, regarding cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19. This article describes the clinical and histological findings of the main skin lesions observed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. DISCUSSION: Cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 have been described in multiple retrospective and prospective studies, case series and case reports. The reported incidence reached 20.4%. Although there was substantial heterogeneity in terms of clinical patterns, the main ones include: erythematous/maculopapular, urticarial, papulovesicular, and purpuric/petechial eruptions, chilblain-like lesions and livedoid/acro-ischemic lesions. In the vast majority, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are not fully understood, although histopathological findings and biomolecular studies can add relevant data. CONCLUSION: The recognition of cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 is of utmost importance. They may help establishing an early diagnosis, namely in oligosymptomatic patients or when confirmatory tests are impossible to perform. Moreover, chilblain-like lesions and acro-ischemia, also seem to play an important role in terms of prognosis.","Relvas, Maria; Calvão, Joana; Oliveira, Raquel; Cardoso, José Carlos; Gonçalo, Margarida",Acta med. port,633,20

Here we present the current knowledge on its epidemiologic features. METHODS: Non-systematic review. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tract. It is mainly transmitted by droplets and aerosols from asymptomatic and symptomatic infected subjects. The consensus estimate for the basis reproduction number (R0) is between 2 and 3, and the median incubation period is 5.7 (range 2-14) days. Similar to SARS and MERS, superspreading events have been reported, the dispersion parameter (kappa) is estimated at 0.1. Most infections are uncomplicated, and 5-10% of patients are hospitalized, mainly due to pneumonia with severe inflammation. Complications are respiratory and multiorgan failure; risk factors for complicated disease are higher age, hypertension, diabetes, chronic cardiovascular, chronic pulmonary disease and immunodeficiency. Nosocomial and infections in medical personnel have been reported. Drastic reductions of social contacts have been implemented in many countries with outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, leading to rapid reductions. Most interventions have used bundles, but which of the measures have been more or less effective is still unknown. The current estimate for the infection's fatality rate is 0.5-1%. Using current models of age-dependent infection fatality rates, upper and lower limits for the attack rate in Germany can be estimated between 0.4 and 1.6%, lower than in most European countries. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a rapid worldwide spread, attack rates have been low in most regions, demonstrating the efficacy of control measures.","Salzberger, Bernd; Buder, Felix; Lampl, Benedikt; Ehrenstein, Boris; Hitzenbichler, Florian; Holzmann, Thomas; Schmidt, Barbara; Hanses, Frank",Infection,633,30

Despite these risks, there have been no consistent statements on surgical guidelines regarding the perioperative screening or management of COVID-19 patients, and we do not have objective global data that describe the current conditions surrounding this issue. This study aimed to clarify the current global surgical practice including COVID-19 screening, preventive measures and in-hospital infection under the COVID-19 pandemic, and to clarify the international gaps on infection control policies among countries worldwide. Methods: During April 2-8, 2020, a cross-sectional online survey on surgical practice was distributed to surgeons worldwide through international surgical societies, social media and personal contacts. Main outcome and measures included preventive measures and screening policies of COVID-19 in surgical practice and centers' experiences of in-hospital COVID-19 infection. Data were analyzed by country's cumulative deaths number by April 8, 2020 (high risk, >5000; intermediate risk, 100-5000; low risk, <100). Results: A total of 936 centers in 71 countries responded to the survey (high risk, 330 centers; intermediate risk, 242 centers; low risk, 364 centers). In the majority (71.9%) of the centers, local guidelines recommended preoperative testing based on symptoms or suspicious radiologic findings. Universal testing for every surgical patient was recommended in only 18.4% of the centers. In-hospital COVID-19 infection was reported from 31.5% of the centers, with higher rates in higher risk countries (high risk, 53.6%; intermediate risk, 26.4%; low risk, 14.8%; P < 0.001). Of the 295 centers that experienced in-hospital COVID-19 infection, 122 (41.4%) failed to trace it and 58 (19.7%) reported the infection originating from asymptomatic patients/staff members. Higher risk countries adopted more preventive measures including universal testing, routine testing of hospital staff and use of dedicated personal protective equipment in operation theatres, but there were remarkable discrepancies across the countries. Conclusions: This large international survey captured the global surgical practice under the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted the insufficient preoperative screening of COVID-19 in the current surgical practice. More intensive screening programs will be necessary particularly in severely affected countries/institutions.

Associations between the use of the Calm app (i.e., adherence to the intervention) and changes in sleep quality was also explored in the intervention group only. Adults with sleep disturbance were recruited (N = 640). Eligible and consenting participants (N = 263) were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 124) or a wait-list control (n = 139) group. Intervention participants were asked to meditate using the Calm app &#8805;10 minutes/day for eight weeks. Fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and pre-sleep arousal were assessed at baseline, mid- (4-weeks) and post-intervention (8-weeks) in both groups, whereas sleep quality was evaluated only in the intervention group. Findings from intent-to-treat analyses suggest the use of the Calm app for eight weeks significantly decreased daytime fatigue (p = .018) as well as daytime sleepiness (p = .003) and cognitive (p = .005) and somatic (p < .001) pre-sleep arousal as compared to the wait-list control group. Within the intervention group, use of the Calm app was associated with improvements in sleep quality (p < .001). This randomized controlled trial demonstrates that the Calm app can be used to treat fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and pre-sleep arousal in adults with sleep disturbance. Given that the Calm app is affordable and widely accessible, these data have implications for community level dissemination of a mobile app to improve sleep-related symptoms associated with sleep disturbance.

Maintaining adequate staffing levels is critical to ensuring high-quality nursing home care and an effective response to the pandemic. We therefore sought to examine nursing home staffing levels during the first nine months of 2020 (compared with the same period in 2019), using auditable daily payroll-based staffing data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We found that the total number of hours of direct care nursing declined in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did the average nursing home census. When we accounted for changes in census, the number of nurse staff hours per resident day remained steady or, if anything, increased slightly during the pandemic. The observed increases in staff hours per resident day were small but concentrated in nursing homes operating in counties with high COVID-19 prevalence, in nursing homes with low Medicaid census (which typically have more financial resources), and in not-for-profit nursing homes (which typically invest more in staffing). These findings raise concerns that although the number of staff hours in nursing homes did not decline, the perception of shortages has been driven by increased stresses and demands on staff time due to the pandemic, which are harder to quantify.","Werner, Rachel M; Coe, Norma B",Health Aff (Millwood),633,26

Effective assessment of biomarker performances are needed to evaluate their clinical usefulness and translation. We defined a realistic ground-truth scenario and compared the effectiveness of different biomarkers alone and combined to localize epileptogenic tissue during surgery. We investigated the performances of univariate, bivariate and multivariate signal biomarkers applied to 1 min inter-ictal intra-operative electrocorticography to discriminate between epileptogenic and non-epileptogenic locations in 47 drug-resistant people with epilepsy (temporal and extra-temporal) who had been seizure-free one year after the operation. The best result using a single biomarker was obtained using the phase-amplitude coupling measure for which the epileptogenic tissue was localized in 17 out of 47 patients. Combining the whole set of biomarkers provided an improvement of the performances: 27 out of 47 patients. Repeating the analysis only on the temporal-lobe resections we detected the epileptogenic tissue in 29 out of 30 combining all the biomarkers. We suggest that the assessment of biomarker performances on a ground-truth scenario is required to have a proper estimate on how biomarkers translate into clinical use. Phase-amplitude coupling seems the best performing single biomarker and combining biomarkers improves localization of epileptogenic tissue. Performance achieved is not adequate as a tool in the operation theater yet, but it can improve the understanding of pathophysiological process.","Demuru, Matteo; Kalitzin, Stiliyan; Zweiphenning, Willemiek; van Blooijs, Dorien; Van039,; t Klooster, Maryse; Van Eijsden, Pieter; Leijten, Frans; Zijlmans, Maeike",Sci Rep,633,26

The impact of the pandemic on illicit drug market remains scant. We expose the potential consequences the COVID-19 pandemic could have on the ability of people who use drugs to source their illicit drugs via cryptomarkets. METHODS: We analyzed 262 self-reported submissions of illicit drug transactions on the darkweb. The self-reports include the date of the transaction, the types of illicit drugs bought/sold, and whether the shipment of the illicit drugs succeeded, had issues (ex. unusually long delivery, an error in the type of drug shipped, quantity or concentration of the drug), or failed. RESULTS: Between January 1st, 2020 and March 21, 2020, successful deliveries represented 60% to 100% of transactions. Starting on March 21 however, the share of shipments that had issues or failed increased rapidly and represented a majority of all shipments. At the peak of the market disruption, the successful deliveries represented only 21% of all transactions. CONCLUSION: Illicit drug transactions on the darkweb were disrupted at the same time as lockdowns were put in place in the United States and in the United Kingdom. While no causation link can be established, the correlation suggests that lockdowns could have disrupted drug cryptomarkets activities. We discuss the market disruption in light of the literature.","Bergeron, Andréanne; Décary-Hétu, David; Giommoni, Luca",Int J Drug Policy,633,23

Our objective was to study how the obligatory social isolation affected stress caregiver and burden of care of family members of subjects living with dementia in the community after the initial 4 weeks of quarantine in our setting. We did a questionnaire survey among 80 family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or related dementia collected on April 2020. We designed a visual analog scale to test the level of the burden of care. Characteristics of people with dementia and their caregivers were analyzed with descriptive (mean, standard deviation, frequency and percent) and inferential statistics (chi-square test). The sample included older adults (mean age: 80.51 ± 7.65) with different stages of dementia. Family was the primary provider of care in 65%. Overall, COVID-19 confinement increased stress caregiver independently of the dementia stage, but those caring for severe cases had more stress compared to milder forms of the disease. Other findings were that half of the subjects with dementia experienced increased anxiety and that most family members discontinued all sort of cognitive and physical therapies. Family members' main concerns were for severe dementia cases, fear of absence of the paid caregiver during the epidemic, and for mild cases fear of spreading the disease while assisting patients with instrumental activities. A partnership between departments of public health, care workers and families must be planned to guarantee continuity of care during these unique COVID-19 times.","Cohen, Gabriela; Russo, María Julieta; Campos, Jorge A; Allegri, Ricardo F",Int Psychogeriatr,633,24

It rapidly spread and many cases were identified in multiple countries, posing a global health problem. Here, we report the first patient cured of COVID-19 infection in Changsha, China, and the symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and management of this patient are all described in this report. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old woman developed cough and fever after returning to Changsha from Wuhan on January 9, 2020. She tested positive for COVID-19 infection, a diagnosis which was supported by chest CT. The patient was treated with lopinavir and ritonavir tablets and interferon alfa-2b injection. A low dose of glucocorticoids was used for a short period to control bilateral lung immune response, and this patient avoided being crushed by cytokine storms that might have occurred. The clinical condition of this patient improved, and a COVID-19 assay conducted on January 25, 2020 generated negative results. This patient recovered and was discharged on January 30, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there are numerous reports on COVID-19 infections focusing on the disease's epidemiological and clinical characteristics. This case describes the symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and management of a patient cured of COVID-19 infection, which may serve as reference for future cases, while further studies are needed.","Zhou, Jian; Cao, Ziqin; Wang, Wanchun; Huang, Kang; Zheng, Fang; Xie, Yuanlin; Jiang, Dixuan; Zhou, Zhiguo",BMC Infect Dis,633,20

BACKGROUND: School closures and homeworking during the Covid-19 crisis have resulted in an immediate increase in unpaid care work, which draws new attention to gender inequality in divisions of unpaid care work. METHODS: Data come from the wave 9 (2017-19) of Understanding Society and the following April (n = 15,426) and May (n = 14,150) waves of Understanding Society Covid-19 study. Psychological distress was measured using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) at both before and during the lockdown, and unpaid care work was measured during the lockdown. Linear regression models were used. RESULTS: Women spent much more time on unpaid care work than men during lockdown, and it was more likely to be the mother than the father who reduced working hours or changed employment schedules due to increased time on childcare. Women who spent long hours on housework and childcare were more likely to report increased levels of psychological distress. Working parents who adapted their work patterns increased more psychological distress than those who did not. This association was much stronger if he or she was the only member in the household who adapted their work patterns, or if she was a lone mother. Fathers increased more psychological distress if they reduced work hours but she did not, compared to neither reducing work hours. CONCLUSION: There are continued gender inequalities in divisions of unpaid care work. Juggling home working with homeschooling and childcare as well as extra housework is likely to lead to poor mental health for people with families, particularly for lone mothers.","Xue, Baowen; McMunn, Anne",PLoS One,633,16

As the disease spread, demands on health care systems increased, specifically the need to expand hospital capacity. Alternative care hospitals (ACHs) have been used to mitigate these issues; however, establishing an ACH has many challenges. The goal of this session was to perform systems testing, using a simulation-based evaluation to identify areas in need of improvement. METHODS: Four simulation cases were designed to depict common and high acuity situations encountered in the ACH, using a high technology simulator and standardized patient. A multidisciplinary observer group was given debriefing forms listing the objectives, critical actions, and specific areas to focus their attention. These forms were compiled for data collection. RESULTS: Logistical, operational, and patient safety issues were identified during the simulation and compiled into a simulation event report. Proposed solutions and protocol changes were made in response to the identified issues. CONCLUSION: Simulation was successfully used for systems testing, supporting efforts to maximize patient care and provider safety in a rapidly developed ACH. The simulation event report identified operational deficiencies and safety concerns directly resulting in equipment modifications and protocol changes.","Petrone, Gianna; Brown, Linda; Binder, William; Naganathan, Sonya; Pasichow, Scott; Rybasack-Smith, Heather; Duquette, Cathy E; Palka, Dana R; Musits, Andrew N",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,633,4

We aimed to share our strategy in handling neurosurgical emergencies at a remote center in Borneo Island. Our objectives included discussing the logistic and geographical challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Miri General Hospital (MGH) is a remote center in Sarawak, Malaysia, serving a population with difficult access to neurosurgical services. Two neurosurgeons were stationed here on a rotational basis every fortnight during the pandemic to handle neurosurgical cases. Patients were triaged depending on their urgent needs for surgery or transfer to a neurosurgical center and managed accordingly. All patients were screened for potential risk of contracting COVID-19 prior to the surgery. Based on this, the level of personal protective equipment required for the healthcare workers involved was determined. Results During the initial six weeks of the Movement Control Order (MCO) in Malaysia, there were 50 urgent neurosurgical consultations. Twenty patients (40%) required emergency surgery or intervention. There were nine vascular (45%), five trauma (25%), four tumor (15%), and two infection cases (10%). Eighteen patients were operated at MGH, among whom 17 (94.4%) survived. Ninety percent of anticipated transfers were avoided. None of the medical staff acquired COVID-19. Conclusions This framework allowed timely intervention for neurosurgical emergencies (within a safe limit), minimized transfer, and enabled uninterrupted neurosurgical services at a remote center with difficult access to neurosurgical care during a pandemic.","Low, Peh Hueh; Mangat, Manvinder Singh; San Liew, Donald Ngian; Hieng Wong, Albert Sii",World Neurosurg,633,3

From 1966 to 1976, the same regime was launching a so-called ‘Great Cultural Revolution’, causing serious cultural and economic damages to this nation. Furthermore, influential theories of the political economy of the former socialist systems emphasize that unless the one-party monopoly is abolished, reforms are doomed to fail.

The appreciation of this entity is important given the significant ramifications upon the occupational health of healthcare workers and could additionally have an impact on persons living with pre-existing headache disorder(s). RECENT FINDINGS: There has been a renewed interest and recognition of PPE-associated headaches amongst healthcare professionals, largely brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which has besieged healthcare systems worldwide. De novo PPE-associated headaches may present with migrainous or tension-type features and can be viewed as a subtype of external compression headache. The prognosis of the disorder is generally favourable, given that most headaches are short-lived without long-term sequalae. Several aetiologies have been postulated to account for the development of these headaches. Notably, these headaches can affect the occupational health and work performance of healthcare workers. SUMMARY: In this review, we discuss the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, probable etiopathogenesis, management and prognosis of PPE-associated headaches in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The present study aimed to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and river water in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, using four quantitative and two nested PCR assays. Influent and secondary-treated (before chlorination) wastewater samples and river water samples were collected five times from a wastewater treatment plant and three times from a river, respectively, between March 17 and May 7, 2020. The wastewater and river water samples (200–5000 mL) were processed by using two different methods: the electronegative membrane-vortex (EMV) method and the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. Based on the observed concentrations of indigenous pepper mild mottle virus RNA, the EMV method was found superior to the membrane adsorption-direct RNA extraction method. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was successfully detected in one of five secondary-treated wastewater samples with a concentration of 2.4 × 103 copies/L by N_Sarbeco qPCR assay following the EMV method, whereas all the influent samples were tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. This result could be attributed to higher limit of detection for influent (4.0 × 103–8.2 × 104 copies/L) with a lower filtration volume (200 mL) compared to that for secondary-treated wastewater (1.4 × 102–2.5 × 103 copies/L) with a higher filtration volume of 5000 mL. None of the river water samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Comparison with the reported COVID-19 cases in Yamanashi Prefecture showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the secondary-treated wastewater sample when the cases peaked in the community. This is the first study reporting the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in Japan.","Haramoto, Eiji; Malla, Bikash; Thakali, Ocean; Kitajima, Masaaki",Sci Total Environ,633,3

The main motivation behind introducing this technology into forensics is to improve mixture deconvolution, especially when a trace consists of the same cell type. Successful studies demonstrate the ability to analyze a mixture by separating single cells and obtaining CE-based STR profiles. This indicates a potential use of the method in other forensic investigations, like forensic DNA phenotyping, in which using mixed traces is not fully recommended. For this study, we collected single-source autopsy blood from which the white cells were first stained and later separated with the DEPArray™ N×T System. Groups of 20, 10, and 5 cells, as well as 20 single cells, were collected and submitted for DNA extraction. Libraries were prepared using the Ion AmpliSeq™ PhenoTrivium Panel, which includes both phenotype (HIrisPlex-S: eye, hair, and skin color) and ancestry-associated SNP-markers. Prior to sequencing, half of the single-cell-based libraries were additionally amplified and purified in order to improve the library concentrations. Ancestry and phenotype analysis resulted in nearly full consensus profiles resulting in correct predictions not only for the cells groups but also for the ten re-amplified single-cell libraries. Our results suggest that sequencing of single cells can be a promising tool used to deconvolute mixed traces submitted for forensic DNA phenotyping.","Diepenbroek, Marta; Bayer, Birgit; Anslinger, Katja",Genes (Basel),633,16

A Case Study from a Large Metropolitan Healthcare Trust,22.648432,2.801811,2020-09-25,"OBJECTIVE: To describe how a fixed regimen of intravitreal injections (IVI) was helpful to continue activity during the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown and to address basic conditions to resume activity. METHODS: A fixed regimen of IVI was conceived to significantly reduce the number of visits while keeping a number of injections related to the best outcomes. We retrospectively collected data of surgeries performed in 2019 and in the first seven months of 2020 and from OCTs in the first semester of 2020. RESULTS: IVI per month, from January to July 2020, were 304, 291, 256, 204, 276, 297 and 322, respectively. Phacoemulsification surgeries in the same period were 397, 408, 171, 0, 304, 391 and 389. Posterior vitrectomies were 23, 21, 17, 10, 21, 28 and 25. Laser sessions were 44, 26, 33, 17, 23 and 33, respectively. OCTs dropped from a mean of 25.7 per day in the first half of March 2020 to 5.8 per day in the second half of March. A mean of 6.5 OCTs per day was made in April, rising to 19.1 in May and 39.5 in June. CONCLUSION: It was possible to keep the ophthalmological activity during the pandemic outbreak due to the existence of a pre-scheduled fixed regimen for IVI and to the availability of personal protective equipment. The air-borne nature of the peril we are facing addresses the need to evaluate the physical conditions of health facilities, including ventilation, size of waiting and consult rooms and the need to avoid elevators.","Campos, António; Oliveira, Nuno; Martins, Joana; Arruda, Henrique; Sousa, João",Clin Ophthalmol,633,16

Group testing has been proposed as a solution to expand testing capabilities but sensitivity concerns may limit its impact on the management of the pandemic. Digital PCR (RT-dPCR) has been shown to be highly sensitive and could help by providing larger testing capabilities without compromising sensitivity. METHODS: We implemented RT-dPCR based COVID-19 group testing on a commercially available system and assay (naica® system from Stilla Technologies) and investigated the sensitivity of the method in real life conditions of a university hospital in Paris, France, in May 2020. We tested the protocol in a direct comparison with reference RT-PCR testing on 448 samples split into groups of 8, 16 and 32 samples for RT-dPCR analysis. RESULTS: Individual RT-PCR testing identified 25/448 positive samples. Using 56 groups of 8, RT-dPCR identified 23 groups as positive, corresponding to 26 positive samples by individual PCR (positive percentage agreement 95.2% [95% confidence interval: 76.2–99.9%]) and including 2 samples not detected by individual RT-PCR but confirmed positive by further investigation. 15 of 28 groups of 16 tested positive, corresponding to 25 positive samples by individual PCR (positive percentage agreement 87.5% [95% confidence interval: 61.7–98.4%]). 14 groups of 32 were fully concordant with individual PCR testing but will need to be confirmed on larger datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed approach of group testing by digital PCR has similar diagnostic sensitivity compared to individual RT-PCR testing for group up to 16 samples. This approach reduces the quantity of reagent needed by up to 80% while reducing costs and increasing capabilities of testing up to 10-fold.","Martin, Alexandra; Storto, Alexandre; Le Hingrat, Quentin; Collin, Gilles; André, Barbara; Mallory, Allison; Dangla, Rémi; Descamps, Diane; Visseaux, Benoit; Gossner, Olivier",J Clin Virol,633,16

In this regard, the optimization of reported information for understanding the mechanistic insights that facilitate the discovery towards new therapeutics is an unmet need. Remdesivir (RDV) is established to inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in distinct viral families including Ebola and SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, its derivatives have the potential to become a broad-spectrum antiviral agent effective against many other RNA viruses. In this study, we performed comparative analysis of RDV, RMP (RDV monophosphate), and RTP (RDV triphosphate) to undermine the inhibition mechanism caused by RTP as it is a metabolically active form of RDV. The MD results indicated that RTP rearranges itself from its initial RMP-pose at the catalytic site towards NTP entry site, however, RMP stays at the catalytic site. The thermodynamic profiling and free-energy analysis revealed that a stable pose of RTP at NTP entrance site seems critical to modulate the inhibition as its binding strength improved more than its initial RMP-pose obtained from docking at the catalytic site. We found that RTP not only occupies the residues K545, R553, and R555, essential to escorting NTP towards the catalytic site, but also interacts with other residues D618, P620, K621, R624, K798, and R836 that contribute significantly to its stability. From the interaction fingerprinting it is revealed that the RTP interact with basic and conserved residues that are detrimental for the RdRp activity, therefore it possibly perturbed the catalytic site and blocked the NTP entrance site considerably. Overall, we are highlighting the RTP binding pose and key residues that render the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp inactive, paving crucial insights towards the discovery of potent inhibitors.","Srivastava, Mitul; Mittal, Lovika; Kumari, Anita; Asthana, Shailendra",Front Mol Biosci,633,2

Our aim is to address the underlying role of immunity and inflammation conditions among different age groups of pediatric patients. METHODS: We recruited pediatric patients confirmed of moderate COVID-19 symptoms, admitted to Wuhan Children's Hospital from January 28th to April 1st in 2020. Patients were divided into four age groups (≤ 1, 1–6, 7–10, and 11–15 years). Demographic information, clinical characteristics, laboratory results of lymphocyte subsets test, immune and inflammation related markers were all evaluated. RESULTS: Analysis included 217/241 (90.0%) of patients with moderate clinical stage disease. Average recovery time of children more than 6 years old was significantly shorter than of children younger than 6 years (P = 0.001). Reduced neutrophils and increased lymphocytes were significantly most observed among patients under 1 year old (P < 0.01). CD19+ B cells were the only significantly elevated immune cells, especially among patients under 1 year old (cell proportion: n = 12, 30.0%, P < 0.001; cell count: n = 13, 32.5%, P < 0.001). While, low levels of immune related makers, such as immunoglobulin (Ig) G (P < 0.001), IgA (P < 0.001), IgM (P < 0.001) and serum complement C3c (P < 0.001), were also mostly found among patients under 1 year old, together with elevated levels of inflammation related markers, such as tumor necrosis factor γ (P = 0.007), interleukin (IL)-10 (P = 0.011), IL-6 (P = 0.008), lactate dehydrogenase (P < 0.001), and procalcitonin (P = 0.007).

The National Institutes of Health called on digital health leaders to contribute to a high-quality data repository that will support researchers to make discoveries that are otherwise not possible with small, limited data sets. OBJECTIVE: To this end, we seek to develop a COVID-19 digital biomarker for early detection of physiological exacerbation or decompensation. We propose the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation Index (CDI) in a 2-phase study that builds on existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics generated by physIQ’s end-to-end cloud platform for continuous physiological monitoring with wearable biosensors. This effort serves to achieve two primary objectives: (1) to collect adequate data to help develop the CDI and (2) to collect rich deidentified clinical data correlating with outcomes and symptoms related to COVID-19 progression. Our secondary objectives include evaluation of the feasibility and usability of pinpointIQ, a digital platform through which data are gathered, analyzed, and displayed. METHODS: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, 2-phase study. Phase I will involve data collection for the digital data hub of the National Institutes of Health as well as data to support the preliminary development of the CDI. Phase II will involve data collection for the hub and contribute to continued refinement and validation of the CDI. While this study will focus on the development of a CDI, the digital platform will also be evaluated for feasibility and usability while clinicians deliver care to continuously monitored patients enrolled in the study. RESULTS: Our target CDI will be a binary classifier trained to distinguish participants with and those without decompensation. The primary performance metric for CDI will be the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with a minimum performance criterion of ≥0.75 (α=.05; power [1–β]=0.80). Furthermore, we will determine the sex or gender and race or ethnicity of the participants, which would account for differences in the CDI performance, as well as the lead time—time to predict decompensation—and its relationship with the ultimate disease severity based on the World Health Organization COVID-19 ordinal scale. CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning techniques on a large data set of patients with COVID-19 could provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and a digital biomarker for COVID-19 decompensation. Through this study, we intend to develop a tool that can uniquely reflect physiological data of a diverse population and contribute to high-quality data that will help researchers better understand COVID-19.

Participants preferred a mix of texting and phone calls to prompt study engagement; 60% of online surveys were completed. Unanticipated participant-researcher communication outside of research scope suggests that the formation of strong relationships and additional support during this transitional time is critical for sustained study engagement. Study findings have practical implications for social work longitudinal research design and effective study implementation. Future social work research is warranted on innovative strategies to boost study and service engagement among AYA with serious co-occurring mental health and developmental instability.","Londoño, Tatiana; Klodnick, Vanessa V.; Emerson, Kaleigh R.; Stevens, Laura; Cohen, Deborah A.",Child Adolesc Social Work J,633,21

METHODS: Cross-sectional study based on an online snowball recruiting questionnaire. Psychological correlates assessed with the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Impact of Event Scale (IES). Binary and multinomial logistic regression models were used to identify risk and protective factors. RESULTS: Final sample included 2,194 individuals aged 60 years or more [mean age (SD)=65.62 (5.05); females: 1,198 (54.6%)]. There were 342 (15.6%) individuals who reported a PMD and 162 (7.4%) who reported a CMD. Avoidant (32.1%) and depressive (25.6%) styles were the most prevalent, regardless of mental health status. Main risk factors for negative affectivity were female gender and history CMD or PMD. However, job stability and the ability to enjoy free time were generally associated with better outcomes. No differences were found in psychological correlates between those with no lifetime history of mental disorder versus PMD on the DASS-21 or IES. However, CMD was associated with higher anxiety scores on the DASS-21 [Odds Ratio=1.838, p<0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of mental status, avoidant and depressive styles were the most prevalent in this older adult sample. Main protective factor in all subgroups was the ability to enjoy free time, whereas the main risk factors were being female and current or past history of mental disorder.","Bobes-Bascarán, Teresa; Sáiz, Pilar A; Velasco, Angela; Martínez-Cao, Clara; Pedrosa, Cristina; Portilla, Almudena; Fuente-Tomas, Lorena de la; García-Alvarez, Leticia; García-Portilla, María P; Bobes, Julio",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,633,25

Their mode of action at the protein level is not completely understood. In DMD, muscle tissue is replaced by fibrotic tissue produced by fibroblasts, reducing mobility. Nuclear factor of activated T-cells 5 (NFAT5) is involved in fibroblast proliferation. By treating one DMD fibroblast cell culture and one of unaffected skeletal muscle fibroblasts with methylprednisolone (MP) or hydrocortisone (HC) for 24 h or 12 d, the antiproliferative properties of glucocorticoids could be unraveled. NFAT5 localization and expression was explored by immunocytochemistry (ICC), Western blotting (WB) and RT-qPCR. NFAT5 and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) colocalization was measured by ImageJ. GR siRNA was used, evaluating GR’s influence on NFAT5 expression during MP and HC treatment. Cell proliferation was monitored by IncuCyte ZOOM. In DMD fibroblasts, treatment with MP for 24 h induced dots (ICC) positive for NFAT5 and colocalizing with GR. After 12 d of MP or HC in DMD fibroblasts, NFAT5 expression was decreased (RT-qPCR and WB) and growth arrest was observed (Incucyte ZOOM), whereas NFAT5 expression and cell growth remained unchanged in unaffected skeletal muscle fibroblasts. This study may help understand the antiproliferative properties of glucocorticoids in DMD fibroblasts.","Herbelet, Sandrine; De Paepe, Boel; De Bleecker, Jan L.",Int J Mol Sci,633,16

Using the framework of the criminal justice OUD service cascade, this study interviewed representatives of prison systems in states most heavily impacted by opioid overdose regarding the provision of medications for OUD (MOUD). METHODS: A stratified sampling strategy included states with high indicators of opioid-overdose deaths. Two sampling strata targeted states with: 1) OUD overdose rates significantly higher than the per capita national average; or 2) high absolute number of OUD overdose fatalities. Interviews were completed with representatives from 21 of the 23 (91%) targeted states in 2019, representing 583 prisons across these states. Interviews assessed service provision across the criminal justice OUD service cascade, including OUD screening, withdrawal management, MOUD availability and provision, overdose prevention, re-entry services, barriers, and needs for training and technical assistance. RESULTS: MOUD (buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone) was available in at least one prison in approximately 90% of the state prison systems and all three medications were available in at least one prison in 62% of systems. However, MOUD provision was limited to subsets of prisons within these systems: 15% provided buprenorphine, 9% provided methadone, 36% provided naltrexone, and only 7% provided all three. Buprenorphine and methadone were most frequently provided to pregnant women or individuals already receiving these at admission, whereas naltrexone was primarily used at release. Funding was the most frequently cited barrier for all medications. CONCLUSION: Study findings yield a complex picture of how, when, and to whom MOUD is provided across prisons within prison systems in states most heavily impacted by opioid overdose in the United States and have implications for expanding availability.

To achieve greater use and efficiency of health information and communication technology (ICT), the whole community of European states needs a model to develop a common strategy to support the implementation of e-health and reduce decision-making difficulties. Our research suggests such a model, starting from the level of adoption to the implementation of e-health and points out the existing disparities in the European countries regarding the difficulties of adopting e-health. We draw a composite index to assess the inequalities present in the quality of life, the public health system, and the adoption of e-health. Furthermore, to return to a hierarchy of European countries, the relative distance method (RDM) is applied by combining various classification criteria. The results identify the European countries with the highest levels of adoption (Denmark, Estonia, Spain, Sweden, Finland, and the United Kingdom), where e-health is routine, and the countries with the lowest levels of adoption (Greece, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Romania, and Slovakia), where e-health is not widespread. These results reveal critical implications in identifying solutions to reduce the gaps between countries, identifying public policies to support the adoption of e-health, and reducing difficulties in decision-making.","Luca, Magda Mihaela; Mustea, Lavinia; Taran, Alexandra; Stefea, Petru; Vatavu, Sorana",Front Public Health,633,28

Sometimes, but not often, a coronavirus can infect both animals and humans. An acute respiratory disease, caused by a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 or SARS-CoV-2 previously known as 2019-nCoV) was identified as the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as it spread throughout China and subsequently across the globe. As of 14th July 2020, a total of 13.1 million confirmed cases globally and 572,426 deaths had been reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the β-coronavirus family and shares extensive genomic identity with bat coronavirus suggesting that bats are the natural host. SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as that for SARS-CoV, the coronavirus associated with the SARS outbreak in 2003. It mainly spreads through the respiratory tract with lymphopenia and cytokine storms occuring in the blood of subjects with severe disease. This suggests the existence of immunological dysregulation as an accompanying event during severe illness caused by this virus. The early recognition of this immunological phenotype could assist prompt recognition of patients who will progress to severe disease. Here we review the data of the immune response during COVID-19 infection. The current review summarizes our understanding of how immune dysregulation and altered cytokine networks contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 patients.","Mortaz, Esmaeil; Tabarsi, Payam; Varahram, Mohammad; Folkerts, Gert; Adcock, Ian M.",Front Immunol,633,24

TMT comprises of transurethral resection of the bladder tumour (TURBT) followed by radiotherapy with concurrent radiosensitisation. TMT studies have shown neo-adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin-based regimens is often given to further improve survival outcomes. A hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen is preferable due to its non-inferiority in local control and late toxicities. Radiosensitisation can comprise concurrent chemotherapy (with gemcitabine, cisplatin or combination fluorouracil and mitomycin), CON (carbogen and nicotinomide) or hyperthermic treatment. Radiotherapy techniques are continuously improving and becoming more personalised. As the bladder is a mobile structure subject to volumetric changes from filling, an adaptive approach can optimise bladder coverage and reduce dose to normal tissue. Adaptive radiotherapy (ART) is an evolving field that aims to overcome this. Improved knowledge of tumour biology and advances in imaging techniques aims to further optimise and personalise treatment.","Portner, R.; Bajaj, A.; Elumalai, T.; Huddart, R.; Murthy, V.; Nightingale, H.; Patel, K.; Sargos, P.; Song, Y.; Hoskin, P.; Choudhury, A.",Clin Transl Radiat Oncol,633,19

This review was undertaken to establish a baseline of evidence on ACP roles and their outcomes, impacts and implementation challenges across the UK. DESIGN: A scoping review was undertaken following JBI methodological guidance. METHODS: 13 online databases (Medline, CINAHL, ASSIA, Embase, HMIC, AMED, Amber, OT seeker, PsycINFO, PEDro, SportDiscus, Osteopathic Research and PenNutrition) and grey literature sources were searched from 2005 to 2020. Data extraction, charting and summary was guided by the PEPPA-Plus framework. The review was undertaken by a multi-professional team that included an expert lay representative. RESULTS: 191 papers met the inclusion criteria (any type of UK evidence, any sector/setting and any profession meeting the Health Education England definition of ACP). Most papers were small-scale descriptive studies, service evaluations or audits. The papers reported mainly on clinical aspects of the ACP role. Most papers related to nursing, pharmacy, physiotherapy and radiography roles and these were referred to by a plethora of different titles. ACP roles were reported to be achieving beneficial impacts across a range of clinical and health system outcomes. They were highly acceptable to patients and staff. No significant adverse events were reported. There was a lack of cost-effectiveness evidence. Implementation challenges included a lack of role clarity and an ambivalent role identity, lack of mentorship, lack of continuing professional development and an unclear career pathway. CONCLUSION: This review suggests a need for educational and role standardisation and a supported career pathway for advanced clinical practitioners (ACPs) in the UK. Future research should: (i) adopt more robust study designs, (ii) investigate the full scope of the ACP role and (iii) include a wider range of professions and sectors.","Evans, Catrin; Poku, Brenda; Pearce, Ruth; Eldridge, Jeanette; Hendrick, Paul; Knaggs, Roger; Blake, Holly; Yogeswaran, Gowsika; McLuskey, John; Tomczak, Philippa; Thow, Ruaridh; Harris, Peter; Conway, Joy; Collier, Richard",BMJ Open,633,1

This unprecedented pharmaceutical feat did not only show commitment, creativity and collaboration of the scientific community, but also provided a swift solution that prevented global healthcare system breakdown. Notwithstanding, the available data show that most of the approved COVID-19 vaccines protect only a proportion of recipients against severe disease but do not prevent clinical manifestation of COVID-19. There is therefore the need to probe further to establish whether these vaccines can induce sterilizing immunity, otherwise, COVID-19 vaccination would have to become a regular phenomenon. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants could further affect the capability of the available COVID-19 vaccines to prevent infection and protect recipients from a severe form of the disease. These notwithstanding, data about which vaccine(s), if any, can confer sterilizing immunity are unavailable. Here, we discuss the immune responses to viral infection with emphasis on COVID-19, and the specific adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and how it can be harnessed to develop COVID-19 vaccines capable of conferring sterilizing immunity. We further propose factors that could be considered in the development of COVID-19 vaccines capable of stimulating sterilizing immunity. Also, an old, but effective vaccine development technology that can be applied in the development of COVID-19 vaccines with sterilizing immunity potential is reviewed.","Kyei-Barffour, Isaac; Addo, Samuel Akwetey; Aninagyei, Enoch; Ghartey-Kwansah, George; Acheampong, Desmond Omane",Biomed Pharmacother,633,16

The mask consisted of the outer, middle, and inner layers to give comfort, strength, shape, and safety. The outer layer contained a total of 4.4 % CuS (w/w) (2.2% CuS coated & 2.2 % CuS impregnated) nylon fibers and the middle entrapment area contain a total of 17.6% CuS (w/w) impregnated nylon. No CuS was present in the inner layer. The antiviral efficacy assessment revealed, CuS incorporated mask is highly effective in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 within 30 min exposure. After, 1h and 2 h exposure, near-complete elimination of virus were observed by cytopathy, fluorescence, and viral copy number. The antiviral activity of the mask material was derived by incorporated solid-state CuS. Noticeably, the antiviral activity of CuS against SARS-CoV-2 was in the form of solid-state CuS, but not as Cu(2+) ionic form derived by dissolved CuSO(4). The kinetics of droplet entrapment revealed, that the three-layered mask almost completely block virus-containing droplet pass-through for short exposure periods of 1 to 2 min, and 80% efficacy for longer exposure times of 5 to 10 min. We also demonstrated the incorporated CuS is evenly distributed all over the fibers assuring the uniformity of potential antiviral activity and proves, CuS particles are not easily shed out of the fabric fibers. The inactivation efficacy demonstrated against SARS-CoV-2 proves that the CuS incorporated three-layer mask will be a lifesaver during the present intense global pandemic.","Hewawaduge, Chamith; Senevirathne, Amal; Jawalagatti, Vijayakumar; Kim, Jang Whan; Lee, John Hwa",Environ Res,633,10

Maintaining the psychological health of a medical team is essential for efficient functioning, but psychological intervention models for emergency medical teams are rare. AIMS: To design a systematic, full-coverage psychological health support scheme for medical teams serving large-scale emergent situations, and demonstrate its effectiveness in a real-world study in Leishenshan Hospital during the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China. METHODS: The scheme integrates onsite and online mental health resources and features team-based psychosocial support and evidence-based interventions. It contained five modules, including a daily measurement of mood, a daily mood broadcast that promotes positive affirmation, a daily online peer-group activity with themes based on the challenges reported by the team, Balint groups and an after-work support team. The daily mood measurement provides information to the other modules. The scheme also respects the special psychological characteristics of medical staff by promoting their strengths. RESULTS: The scheme economically supported a special medical team of 156 members with only one onsite psychiatrist. Our data reflected that the entire medical team maintained an overall positive outlook (7–9 out of 10 in a Daily Mood Index, DMI) for nearly 6 weeks of continuous working. Since the scheme promoted self-strengths and positive self-affirmation, the number of self-reports of life-related gains were high and played a significant effect on the DMI. Our follow-up investigations also revealed that multiple modules of the scheme received high attention and evaluation levels. CONCLUSION: Our quantitative data from Leishenshan hospital, Wuhan, China, show that the programme is adequate to support the continuous high workload of medical teams.

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that early prebiotic or probiotic supplementation would reduce the risk of virus-associated RTIs during the first year of life in a cohort of preterm infants. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT00167700), 94 preterm infants (gestational age, ≥32 + 0 and ≤36 + 6 weeks; birth weight, >1500 g) treated at Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland, were allocated to receive oral prebiotics (galacto-oligosaccharide and polydextrose mixture, 1:1), a probiotic (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, ATCC 53103), or placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) between days 3 and 60 of life. The primary outcome was the incidence of clinically defined virus-associated RTI episodes confirmed from nasal swabs by using nucleic acid testing. Secondary outcomes were the severity and duration of RTIs. RESULTS: A significantly lower incidence of RTIs was detected in infants receiving prebiotics (rate ratio [RR], 0.24; 95% CI, 0.12-0.49; P < .001) or probiotics (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.90; P = .022) compared with those receiving placebo. Also, the incidence of rhinovirus-induced episodes, which comprised 80% of all RTI episodes, was found to be significantly lower in the prebiotic (RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.14-0.66; P = .003) and probiotic (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.24-1.00; P = .051) groups compared with the placebo group. No differences emerged among the study groups in rhinovirus RNA load during infections, duration of rhinovirus RNA shedding, duration or severity of rhinovirus infections, or occurrence of rhinovirus RNA in asymptomatic infants.

Materials and Methods This cross-sectional observational study was conducted at Altamash Institute of Dental Medicine, Karachi from June 2020 to August 2020. A total of 775 patients participated to fill questionnaire. After scrutiny, 25 questionnaire forms were excluded due to incomplete information. Questionnaire was divided in to four sections. First section obtained patients sociodemographic information, while knowledge of patients regarding cross-infection control during COVID-19 pandemic was evaluated in second section. Similarly, the purpose of third section was to assess attitude and fourth section was designed to evaluate practice. Likert’s 3-point scale was used for registration of participant’s response. The reliability of questionnaire was assessed through Crohnbach’s α (α = 0.74). Statistical analysis was performed after entering data in to SPSS version 25. Independent t -test was used to evaluate the difference in patients’ knowledge, attitude, and practice. A p -value ≤ 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results Majority of the participants agreed that COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease (631, 97%) and daily screening of staff, dental assistants, dentists, and patients is necessary (568, 75.7%) along with proper sterilization of instruments and disinfection of dental operatory (650, 86.66%). A large number of participant also agreed that proper disposal of waste is utmost important for cross-infection control (601, 80.24%) and patient's waiting area should also be marked with social distancing sign (620, 82.66%). However, when asked about the common route of COVID-19 transmission in dentistry, 341 (45.5%) participants disagreed that it is not through aerosol (water droplets) generated during dental procedures. Conclusions Dental health professionals should take additional measures to educate dental patients on mechanism of potential spread of COVID-19 through the aerosols and droplets generated during dental procedures. They should also encourage the dental patients to be vigilant and question the cross-infection control measures practiced by the dentist to whom they go for dental treatment, and to decrease their chances of acquiring an infection during their visit to the dental office.","Ahmed, Muhammad Adeel; Jouhar, Rizwan; Adnan, Samira; Ahmed, Naseer; Ghazal, Tuba; Adanir, Necdet",Eur J Dent,633,26

For instance, the H1N1 influenza pandemic affected many people, with those who incurred it suffering significant morbidity. A recent study published in the Journal of Cystic Fibrosis has shown 40 confirmed cases of CF patients with SARS-CoV-2 worldwide up to April 2020. This is a unique case of a cystic fibrosis patient with ARDS with SARS-CoV-2 that required mechanical ventilation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 23-year-old Caucasian male with double-lung transplant due to cystic fibrosis, complicated by pancreatic insufficiency presented with acute dyspnea, cough, and fever. He was immunosuppressed due to tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and chronic prednisone use. His mycophenolate was held in the setting of presumed sepsis however his tacrolimus and prednisone were continued given the risk of rejection. Subsequently, his respiratory status rapidly declined prompting admission to the Intensive Care Unit for mechanical ventilation. Computed tomography of the chest endorsed worsening acute respiratory distress syndrome-like feature requiring high positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] settings. Labs revealed elevated d-dimer, CRP, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and clinical features consistent with cytokine storm. Recent literature suggested a possible role of tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 antibody. He received 400mg of Tocilizumab, following which the patient drastically improved. ICU care was challenging because of potential pharmacologic variance and adynamic ileus in the setting of cystic fibrosis with sedation and paralytics. Patient was liberated after 5 days of mechanical ventilation. Interestingly, he remained SARS-COV-2 positive post discharge for several weeks afterward. DISCUSSION: This critically ill immunosuppressed patient, unusually, exhibited rapid recovery. From the 40 patients in the study from Journal of Cystic Fibrosis, there was no mortality reported and only one patient reported to require mechanical ventilation associated with SARS-CoV-2. Factors that may have influenced this patient's recovery and lower mortality is the prompt use of Tocilizumab and his young age. Tocilizumab is currently an experimental medication, noted to inhibit further clinical deterioration. CONCLUSION(S): Fortunately, this case did not have long term consequences, however, that may not be the norm. Many CF patients have double lung transplants and the long-term impact of SARS-CoV-2 amongst CF patients is not known. More research may be warranted for the long-term effects of CF patients with SARS-CoV-2. Reference #1: Rebecca Cosgriff, Susannah Ahern, Scott C.

The impact of this on emergency department (ED) attendances is unknown, especially for non-COVID-19 related emergencies. METHODS: This analysis is an observational study of ED attendances at the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (ICHNT). We calibrated auto-regressive integrated moving average time-series models of ED attendances using historic (2015–2019) data. Forecasted trends were compared to present year ICHNT data for the period between March 12, 2020 (when England implemented the first COVID-19 public health measure) and May 31, 2020. We compared ICHTN trends with publicly available regional and national data. Lastly, we compared hospital admissions made via the ED and in-hospital mortality at ICHNT during the present year to the historic 5-year average. RESULTS: ED attendances at ICHNT decreased by 35% during the period after the first lockdown was imposed on March 12, 2020 and before May 31, 2020, reflecting broader trends seen for ED attendances across all England regions, which fell by approximately 50% for the same time frame. For ICHNT, the decrease in attendances was mainly amongst those aged < 65 years and those arriving by their own means (e.g. personal or public transport) and not correlated with any of the spatial dependencies analysed such as increasing distance from postcode of residence to the hospital. Emergency admissions of patients without COVID-19 after March 12, 2020 fell by 48%; we did not observe a significant change to the crude mortality risk in patients without COVID-19 (RR 1.13, 95%CI 0.94–1.37, p = 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings reflect broader trends seen across England and give an indication how emergency healthcare seeking has drastically changed. At ICHNT, we find that a larger proportion arrived by ambulance and that hospitalisation outcomes of patients without COVID-19 did not differ from previous years. The extent to which these findings relate to ED avoidance behaviours compared to having sought alternative emergency health services outside of hospital remains unknown. National analyses and strategies to streamline emergency services in England going forward are urgently needed.

However, the true infection rate remains unknown. We aimed to assess the seroprevalence of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 18 cities of Iran as an indicator of the infection rate. METHODS: In this population-based cross-sectional study, we randomly selected and invited study participants from the general population (from lists of people registered with the Iranian electronic health record system or health-care centres) and a high-risk population of individuals likely to have close social contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals through their occupation (from employee lists provided by relevant agencies or companies, such as supermarket chains) across 18 cities in 17 Iranian provinces. Participants were asked questions on their demographic characteristics, medical history, recent COVID-19-related symptoms, and COVID-19-related exposures. Iran Food and Drug Administration-approved Pishtaz Teb SARS-CoV-2 ELISA kits were used to detect SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies in blood samples from participants. Seroprevalence was estimated on the basis of ELISA test results and adjusted for population weighting (by age, sex, and city population size) and test performance (according to our independent validation of sensitivity and specificity). FINDINGS: From 9181 individuals who were initially contacted between April 17 and June 2, 2020, 243 individuals refused to provide blood samples and 36 did not provide demographic information and were excluded from the analysis. Among the 8902 individuals included in the analysis, 5372 had occupations with a high risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and 3530 were recruited from the general population. The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted prevalence of antibody seropositivity in the general population was 17·1% (95% CI 14·6–19·5), implying that 4 265 542 (95% CI 3 659 043–4 887 078) individuals from the 18 cities included were infected by the end of April, 2020. The adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies varied greatly by city, with the highest estimates found in Rasht (72·6% [53·9–92·8]) and Qom (58·5% [37·2–83·9]). The overall population weight-adjusted and test performance-adjusted seroprevalence in the high-risk population was 20·0% (18·5–21·7) and showed little variation between the occupations included. INTERPRETATIONS: Seroprevalence is likely to be much higher than the reported prevalence of COVID-19 based on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Iran. Despite high seroprevalence in a few cities, a large proportion of the population is still uninfected. The potential shortcomings of current public health policies should therefore be identified to prevent future epidemic waves in Iran.

The Gallup’s tracking poll findings from 9/16/2020 to 9/29/2020 showed that 63% of Americans would be agreeable to being vaccinated if an FDA-approved vaccine were available to them at no cost. A survey conducted in France from March to July 2020 to determine COVID-19 vaccine acceptance specifically amongst health care workers (HCW) revealed that 75% of their HCWs intended to be vaccinated. Our literature search however did not yield studies assessing the acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine amongst HCWs, specifically in the United States. The aim of this study was to determine COVID-19 vaccination rates amongst HCWs within a single hospital, any differences between HCWs acceptability of the vaccine, and which factors were most important in their decision-making. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study of HCWs at Ascension Macomb-Oakland Hospital was conducted in February 2021 – March 2021 soon after vaccines became available at the hospital. A SurveyMonkey was mass-distributed by email to HCWs including doctors, nurses, administrators, pharmacists, technicians, and secretaries. Any HCW that was over the age of 18 years of age was eligible to participate. A series of 15 questions were asked in a multiple choice and scale format. Result: A total of 574 out of the ∼2900 HCWs completed the survey. Of these, 487 (84.8%) either accepted or intended to get vaccinated within the next 3 months. 62 (10.8%) would decline the vaccine over the next 3 months and 25 (4.4%) remained undecided. The mean age of respondents was 45. The majority of surveys were completed by females (75.7%). The mean age of HCWs willing to accept the vaccine was greater compared to those who declined the vaccine (40 years of age vs 46 years of age). There was a higher proportion of Democrats willing to accept the vaccine than those who declined the vaccine (27% vs 9.8%). The most important factors for those that decided to take the vaccine were protection of their own health;protection of health of patients, family, or friends;and trust in the science. The most important factors in those that either declined or were undecided about the vaccine were concern for safety profile and side effects of vaccine, uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine, and the accelerated development of the vaccine. Conclusions: As one of the nation’s hotspots for the highest rates of positive COVID-19 cases and deaths, a survey to assess acceptability of a COVID-19 vaccine showed that a majority of HCWs had either taken or planned to take the vaccine. HCWs background in science and the proximity and frequency in which they work with COVID-19+ patients were felt to account for the difference in vaccination rates between the general public and HCWs.","Choi, T.; Pitus, K.; Boura, J.; Pearson, C.; Stav, J.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,633,20

The pandemic’s etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2, is a member of the Coronaviridae, and as such, is an enveloped virus with ion channels in its membrane. Therefore, in an attempt to provide an option to curb the viral spread, we searched for blockers of its E protein viro-porin. Using three bacteria-based assays, we identified eight compounds that exhibited activity after screening a library of ca. 3000 approved-for-human-use drugs. Reassuringly, analysis of viral replication in tissue culture indicated that most of the compounds could reduce infectivity to varying extents. In conclusion, targeting a particular channel in the virus for drug repurposing may increase our arsenal of treatment options to combat COVID-19 virulence. Significance Statement The goal of our study was to expand the treatment arsenal against COVID-19. To that end, we have decided to focus on drug therapy, and as a target - the E protein, an ion channel in the virus. Ion channels as a family are excellent drug targets, but viral channels have been underexploited for pharmaceutical point intervention. To hasten future regulatory requirements and focus the chemical search space, we screened a library of ca. 3000 approved-for-human-use drugs using three independent bacteria-based assays. Our results yielded eight compounds, which were subsequently tested for antiviral activity in tissue culture. Gratifyingly, most compounds were able to reduce viral replication, and as such, both validate our approach and potentially augment our anti-COVID tool kit.","Tomar, Prabhat Pratap Singh; Krugliak, Miriam; Arkin, Isaiah Tuvia",bioRxiv,633,14

Therefore, more studies are needed to understand the rate and the predications of AKI involvement among hospitalized COVID-19 patients and AKI’s impact on prognosis while under different types of medications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective observational cohort study conducted at Bahrain Defence Force (BDF) Royal Medical Services. Medical records of COVID-19 patients admitted to BDF hospital, treated, and followed up from April 2020 to October 2020 were retrieved. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression with covariate adjustment, and the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence (95% CI) interval were reported. RESULTS: Among 353 patients admitted with COVID-19, 47.6% developed AKI. Overall, 51.8% of patients with AKI died compared to 2.2% of patients who did not develop AKI (p< 0.001 with OR 48.6 and 95% CI 17.2–136.9). Besides, deaths in patients classified with AKI staging were positively correlated and multivariate regression analysis revealed that moderate to severe hypoalbuminemia (<32 g/L) was independently correlated to death in AKI patients with an OR of 10.99 (CI 95% 4.1–29.3, p<0.001). In addition, 78.2% of the dead patients were on mechanical ventilation. Besides age as a predictor of AKI development, diabetes and hypertension were the major risk factors of AKI development (OR 2.04, p<0.01, and 0.05 for diabetes and hypertension, respectively). Also, two or more comorbidities substantially increased the risk of AKI development in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, high levels upon hospital admission of D-Dimer, Troponin I, and ProBNP and low serum albumin were associated with AKI development. Lastly, patients taking ACEI/ARBs had less chance to develop AKI stage II/III with OR of 0.19–0.27 (p<0.05–0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of AKI in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and the mortality rate among AKI patients were high and correlated with AKI staging. Furthermore, laboratory testing for serum albumin, hypercoagulability and cardiac injury markers maybe indicative for AKI development. Therefore, clinicians should be mandated to perform such tests on admission and follow-up in hospitalized patients.","Naser, Maryam N.; Al-Ghatam, Rana; Darwish, Abdulla H.; Alqahtani, Manaf M.; Alahmadi, Hajar A.; Mohamed, Khalifa A.; Hasan, Nahed K.; Perez, Nuria S.",PLoS One,633,18

Pediatric patients can rarely present with a severe complication identified as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).(1) After its recognition by the CDC and media reports of young adults with the same syndrome, a series of cases in adults (MIS-A) was published in late 2020.(2) CASE PRESENTATION: A 25-year-old Hispanic male who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR six weeks prior presented to the emergency department with one week of sore throat, fever, non-bloody diarrhea, conjunctivitis, and mild confusion. On examination, the patient was febrile, had tender submandibular lymph nodes and redness on the oropharynx. Initial laboratory results showed systemic inflammation. COVID-19 RT-PCR test was negative, coronavirus IgG was positive, and chest radiograph was normal. On the third day, the patient's clinical status deteriorated despite antibiotic use with hypotension and hypoxemia requiring vasopressor support and ICU admission. An echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 35% with hypokinesia. Due to persistent shock state and elevated inflammatory markers after 36 hours, we started him on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg daily. After 24 hours, clinical status and inflammatory markers improved significantly. A follow-up echocardiogram four weeks after discharge showed normalization of EF. DISCUSSION: Since the beginning of the pandemic, different countries reported cases of a hyperinflammatory process in children that had features similar to atypical Kawasaki disease.(3) A larger study described MIS-C in 99 patients under 21 years of age in New York.(4) The case definition MIS-C was established by the CDC. For a time, it was unknown if this syndrome was specific to children or whether it also occurred in adults. A MIS-A working case definition includes five criteria: severe illness requiring hospitalization in a person aged at least 21 years;a positive test result for current or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection;severe dysfunction of one or more extrapulmonary organ systems;laboratory evidence of severe inflammation;and absence of severe respiratory illness.(2) Case definitions for MIS-C/A with degrees of diagnostic certainty have also been elaborated.(5) We are presenting a patient that meets clinical and laboratory criteria for MIS-A. His respiratory dysfunction occurred after admission when his inflammatory markers were already elevated. This case includes a temporal correlation after the initial peak of COVID-19 cases in Houston by 31 days. CONCLUSIONS: The number of cases of MIS-A is unclear. It is important to keep this condition in our differential in the context of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection for early identification and appropriate treatment to reduce further harm and mortality.

According to the American Hospital Association, the pandemic has created a $202 billion loss across the healthcare industry, forcing health care systems to lay off workers and making hospitals scramble to minimize supply chain costs. However, as the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) grows, hospitals have sacrificed sustainable solutions for disposable options that, although convenient, will exacerbate supply strains, financial burden, and waste. We advocate for reusable gowns as a means to lower health care costs, address climate change, and improve resilience while preserving the safety of health care workers. Reusable gowns' polyester material provides comparable capacity to reduce microbial cross-transmission and liquid penetration. In addition, previous hospitals have reported a 50% cost reduction in gown expenditures after adopting reusable gowns; given the current 2000% price increase in isolation gowns during COVID-19, reusable gown use will build both healthcare resilience and security from price fluctuations. Finally, with the United States' medical waste stream worsening, reusable isolation gowns show promising reductions in energy and water use, solid waste, and carbon footprint. The gowns are shown to withstand laundering 75–100 times in contrast to the single-use disposable gown. The circumstances of the pandemic forewarn the need to shift our single-use PPE practices to standardized reusable applications. Ultimately, sustainable forms of protective equipment can help us prepare for future crises that challenge the resilience of the healthcare system.","Baker, Natalie; Bromley-Dulfano, Rebecca; Chan, Joshua; Gupta, Anshal; Herman, Luciana; Jain, Navami; Taylor, Anita Lowe; Lu, Jonathan; Pannu, Jaspreet; Patel, Lisa; Prunicki, Mary",Front Public Health,633,16

As elective urologic procedures are being reduced to conserve resources, we sought to quantify the PPE used per case to determine the impact on potentially limited resources needed for protecting healthcare providers treating COVID-19 patients. Methods An IRB approved retrospective analysis of all urologic procedures in March 2019 and March 2020 was performed. Additionally, all urologic procedures performed by vascular interventional radiology (VIR) in May 2019 and March 2020 were included in the analysis. Case length, surgical and operating room staff present and number of articles of PPE were quantified. Articles of PPE were defined as surgical bonnet/hat and mask, and disposable or reusable gown with one pair of surgical gloves. Results 437 urologic and VIR procedures were included in the analysis. The mean PPE per case varied significantly between endoscopic and robotic categories. Robotic assisted laparoscopic cystectomy required the most hats and masks (14.5 per case in March 2019) whereas percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) tube placement by VIR required the fewest (3.1 in May 2019 and March 2020). Conclusions PPE consumption varied significantly across urologic procedures. Robotic-assisted cases require the most PPE and PCN placement by VIR requires the fewest. While PPE shortages are currently being addressed national and internationally, our results provide a baseline benchmark for articles of PPE required should another pandemic or global disaster requiring careful attention to resource allocation occur in the future.","Sobel, David; Gn, Martus; O'Rourke, Timothy K.; Tucci, Chris; Pareek, Gyan; Golijanin, Dragan; Elsamra, Sammy",Urology,633,16

The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates entry into host cells, and thus is the target of neutralizing antibodies. Here, we show that adjuvanted protein immunization with soluble SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers, stabilized in prefusion conformation, results in potent antibody responses in mice and rhesus macaques, with neutralizing antibody titers exceeding those typically measured in SARS-CoV-2 seropositive humans by more than one order of magnitude. Neutralizing antibody responses were observed after a single dose, with exceptionally high titers achieved after boosting. A follow-up to monitor the waning of the neutralizing antibody responses in rhesus macaques demonstrated durable responses that were maintained at high and stable levels at least 4 months after boosting. These data support the development of adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized spike protein subunit vaccines.","Mandolesi, Marco; Sheward, Daniel J.; Hanke, Leo; Ma, Junjie; Pushparaj, Pradeepa; Perez Vidakovics, Laura; Kim, Changil; Àdori, Monika; Lenart, Klara; Loré, Karin; Castro Dopico, Xaquin; Coquet, Jonathan M.; McInerney, Gerald M.; Karlsson Hedestam, Gunilla B.; Murrell, Ben",Cell Rep Med,633,26

Nonetheless, data about the significance of cTn in elderly subjects with COVID-19 are lacking. METHODS: From a registry of consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to a hub hospital in Italy from 25/02/2020 to 03/07/2020, we selected those ≥ 60 year-old and with cTnI measured within three days from the molecular diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. When available, a second cTnI value within 48 h was also extracted. The relationship between increased cTnI and all-cause in-hospital mortality was evaluated by a Cox regression model and restricted cubic spline functions with three knots. RESULTS: Of 343 included patients (median age: 75.0 (68.0−83.0) years, 34.7% men), 88 (25.7%) had cTnI above the upper-reference limit (0.046 µg/L). Patients with increased cTnI had more comorbidities, greater impaired respiratory exchange and higher inflammatory markers on admission than those with normal cTnI. Furthermore, they died more (73.9%vs. 37.3%, P < 0.001) over 15 (6−25) days of hospitalization. The association of elevated cTnI with mortality was confirmed by the adjusted Cox regression model (HR = 1.61, 95%CI: 1.06−2.52, P = 0.039) and was linear until 0.3 µg/L, with a subsequent plateau. Of 191 (55.7%) patients with a second cTnI measurement, 49 (25.7%) had an increasing trend, which was not associated with mortality (univariate HR = 1.39, 95%CI: 0.87−2.22, P = 0.265). CONCLUSIONS: In elderly COVID-19 patients, an initial increase in cTn is common and predicts a higher risk of death.

Aim and Methods: We estimated the impact of the current treatments on the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 by a meta-analysis. The comprehensive search included studies reporting clinical features and treatment strategies published from January 21, 2020, to May 15, 2020. Results: We included 52 studies that involved 13,966 COVID-19 patients. We found that the most prevalent treatments were antivirals (proportion: 0.74, 95% CI : [0.65, 0.83]) and antibiotics (proportion: 0.73, 95% CI: [0.62, 0.83]). The COVID-19 severity increased among patients taking glucocorticoids (risk ratio (RR) = 1.71, 95% CI: [1.06, 2.76]) or immunoglobulins (RR = 3.83, 95% CI: [1.27, 11.53]), and renal replacement therapy (RRT) and glucocorticoids increased the length of ICU stay (RRT : RR= 11.89, 95% CI: [3.26, 43.39]; glucocorticoids: RR = 3.10, 95% CI: [1.52, 6.29]). The COVID-19 severity and mortality increased among patients taking tocilizumab (severity: F = 25.53, P = 0.02; mortality: F = 19.37, P = 0.02). The most effective treatment was the combination of arbidol with lopinavir/ritonavir compared with placebo (mean difference = 0.5, 95% CI [-0.60, 1.66]), and the safest combination was remdesivir and lopinavir/ritonavir (RR= 0.78, 95% CI [0.32, 1.91]). Conclusion: glucocorticoids, immunoglobulins, RRT, and tocilizumab might worsen COVID-19 outcomes, and the most effective and safest treatment strategy for COVID-19 is the combination of different antivirals.","Abdelrahman, Zeinab; Liu, Qian; Jiang, Shanmei; Li, Mengyuan; Zhang, Yue; Wang, Xiaosheng",,633,20

The article offers an account of the “pendular migrations” and “return migrations” that the indigenous and black rural populations of that region carry out as a result of daily labor displacements, in the search for medical-hospital assistance and the consolidation of political and legal visibility within the cities. In a second effort, directly related to the previous one, we articulate the interference of the viral threat not on the contingency of population flow, but on the dangerous intensification of people circulation between the territorial nuclei of the “first habitation” and the average Amazonian cities, where, as a rule, these peoples maintain “second residences” and to where they regularly transmigrate. To illustrate this phenomenon, three accounts of different Brazilian Amazonian realities are reported: on the rural black population of the banks of the Turiaçu River, Maranhão state, the indigenous people of the savannah Lavrado, of the northeast of Roraima state, and the Mura people, who live in the southeast region of Amazonas state. On these realities, the cosmographies of the mobility of their populations are challenged by the changes and strategic conditions imposed by the pandemic.","Baines, Stephen Grant; de Castro Pereira, Márcia Leila; dos Santos, Potyguara Alencar",Front Sociol,633,6

Once COVID-19 vaccines become widely available, it will be necessary to maximize public vaccine acceptance and coverage. OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to analyze the predictors of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Russia. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among Russian adults from September 26(th) to November 9(th), 2020. Predictors of the intent to take up COVID-19 vaccination were explored using logistic regression. RESULTS: Out of 876 participants, 365 (41.7%) would be willing to receive the vaccine if it became available. Acceptance increased for a vaccine with verified safety and effectiveness (63.2%). Intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine was relatively higher among males (aOR=2.37, 95% CI 1.41-4.00), people with lower monthly income (aOR=2.94, 95%CI 1.32-6.57), and with positive trust in the healthcare system (aOR=2.73, 95% CI 1.76-4.24). The Russian people were more likely to accept the COVID-19 vaccine if they believed that the vaccine reduces the risk of virus infection (aOR=8.80, 95%CI 5.21-14.87) or relieves the complications of the disease (aOR=10.46, 95%CI 6.09-17.96).

CONCLUSIONS: The study showed the usefulness of the health belief model constructs in understanding the COVID-19 vaccination acceptance rate in the Russian population. This rate was influenced by sociodemographic and health-related characteristics, and health beliefs. These findings might help guide future efforts for policymakers and stakeholders to improve vaccination rates by enhancing trust in the healthcare system.","Tran, Van D.; Pak, Tatiana V.; Gribkova, Elena I.; Galkina, Galina A.; Loskutova, Ekaterina E.; Dorofeeva, Valeria V.; Dewey, Rebecca S.; Nguyen, Kien T.; Pham., Duy T.",Pharm Pract (Granada),633,23

A large proportion of the Hong Kong elderly population has not undergone influenza vaccination. An exploration of the correlates will provide significant information to help identify ways of improving vaccination uptake among Chinese elderly people. OBJECTIVES: To explore the prevalence and correlates of influenza vaccination Hong Kong Chinese elderly people aged 65 or above. To investigate any differences in attitudes toward influenza vaccination among Hong Kong elderly people with different levels of cognitive and physical functioning. DESIGN: An exploratory cross-sectional survey with two objective assessments was employed. Settings: Fifteen elderly centers in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Participants: A total of 816 Hong Kong Chinese elderly participants were recruited. METHODS: Face-to-face interviews were adopted to explore the demographic characteristics, perceptions, health status, knowledge, and resources of, and the influence of disease outbreaks on, influenza vaccination. Two objective validated instruments, the Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination (CMMSE) and the Barthel Index-Modified Chinese Version (MCBI) were used to assess the cognitive status and physical functioning of the participants. RESULTS: Approximately two in three individuals (62.4%) had undergone influenza vaccination. Lower cognitive and physical functioning scores were found among the non-vaccinated participants. Multivariate logistic regression analyzes revealed the significant correlates associated with influenza vaccination to be consideration of vaccination in the subsequent years (aOR = 7.877; p < 0.001); consideration of vaccination if all people aged 65 or above were eligible to receive free vaccination (aOR = 3.024; p = 0.002); the belief that there is a need to receive influenza vaccination following the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza (aOR = 2.413; p = 0.001); receiving advice from nursing staff of elderly centers (aOR = 7.161; p < 0.001); the medical staff of elderly centers (aOR = 3.771; p < 0.001) or family members or friends (aOR = 3.023; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of elderly Chinese people undergoing influenza vaccination remains suboptimal. The government can promote vaccination by educating the public about the advantages, by publicizing locations where vaccinations are available, and having nursing, other medical staff, family and friends encourage elderly people to be vaccinated.

Since the emergence, research has explored conditions associated with the illness; however, racial disparities remain underexplored. The purpose of this paper is to explore disparities in conditions associated with an increased severity risk of COVID-19 including race, personal factors, healthcare accessibility, and affordability. Using data from the 2018 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), univariate and multivariate analysis were performed. More Non-Hispanic (NH) Blacks (61.1%) and NH Whites (61.2%) had conditions associated with increased severity risk of COVID-19 compared to Hispanics (47.1%) (p < .001). Racial differences revealed a higher proportion of NH Blacks with increased severity risk of COVID-19 were female (p < .001), not married (p < .001), not employed for wages (p < .001), had accessibility issues with transportation (p < .001), and had affordability issues with paying for medicine (p < .001). A higher proportion of Hispanic persons had a health place change (p = .020), had accessibility issues (e.g. telephone (p < .001), longer wait times (p < .001), closed facility (p = .038)) and had affordability issue with worrying about pay (p < .001). Significant predictors that were positively associated with increased severity risk of COVID-19 for all racial/ethnic groups were being NH Black, older age, having appointment issues, and affordability issues with medicine. Differences in magnitude across racial group dynamics were observed. Racial disparities exist in conditions associated with increased severity risk of COVID-19. As future policies and interventions are developed, it is important to consider differentials across racial group dynamics.","Clay, Shondra Loggins; Woodson, Markisha J.; Mazurek, Kathryn; Antonio, Beverly",Race Soc Probl,633,5

We report the main difficulties encountered by oncologists across the country during the pandemic. Methods: We conducted a national online survey on medical, surgical, and radiation oncologists to investigate their practice changes during the COVID-19 pandemic from March 2020 to January 2021. Results: 136 oncologists responded to the survey (surgical oncologists 35.8%, medical oncologists 37.8%, and radiation oncologists 26.4%);80% were working in public hospitals. Among oncologists working in the public sector, 59% were asked to join covid-19 units. Five percent stated that their cancer care units were requisitioned for the management of COVID-19 patients and therefore, their patients were referred to other hospitals to pursue their treatment. Moreover, when comparing the number of new cancer cases diagnosed during and before covid-19, 63% of the surveyed oncologists reported a decrease in the number of new cases while 27% stated that the number was stable. During the lockdown, 45% of the participants noted that only 25 to 50% of their patients attended the follow-up visits and that 83% of them missed their CT imaging appointments. On the other hand, 62% of the surveyed oncologists stated that their patients experienced delayed curative surgeries, and 41% had chemotherapy delays. Decreased consultations at the emergency oncology departments were reported by 88% of the oncologists. Besides, 40% of oncologists reported that they adopted telemedicine to monitor patients during the lockdown, and, 48 % stated that they participated in videoconferences to learn about patients’ management during the pandemic. Finally, 46% of the surveyed oncologists reported losing patients due to the COVID-19 infection, which was a trigger for anxiety symptoms in 35% of the participants. Conclusions: Oncologists reported deleterious effects of COVID-19 on oncology practice and patients’ management. Establishing standardized practice guidelines during the pandemic may help to decrease oncologists’ distress and reassure them about the appropriateness of their treatment policies.

The purpose of this study is to assess whether SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the risk of miscarriage. Firstly, a narrative review of the literature on animal and human studies was performed to analyze the immunopathological mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection during preconception and early pregnancy, by which it may increase the risk of miscarriage. Secondly, a systematic review/meta-analysis of studies was conducted to assess the prevalence of miscarriage in COVID-19 patients diagnosed during pregnancy. Meta-analysis of proportions was used to combine data, and pooled proportions were reported. Seventeen case series and observational studies and 10 prevalence meta-analyses were selected for the review. The estimate of the overall miscarriage rate in pregnant women with COVID-19 was 15.3% (95% CI 10.94 to 20.59) and 23.1 (95% CI 13.17 to 34.95) using fixed and random effect models, respectively. Based on the data in the current literature, the miscarriage rate (<22 weeks gestation) in women with SARS-CoV-2 infection is in the range of normal population.

A number of clinical trials have been conducted and published. However, there is no systematic review or meta-analysis on their efficacy and safety for the common cold to justify their clinical use. METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, SinoMed, CNKI, VIP, China Important Conference Papers Database, China Dissertation Database, and online clinical trial registry websites for published and unpublished randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of CPMs for the common cold till 31 March 2013. Revman 5.2 software was used for data analysis with effect estimate presented as relative risk (RR) and mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of five RCTs were identified. All of the RCTs were of high risk of bias with flawed study design and poor methodological quality. All RCTs included children aged between 6 months to 14 years. Results of individual trials showed that Shuanghuanglian oral liquid (RR 4.00; 95% CI: 2.26 to 7.08), and Xiaoer Resuqing oral liquid (RR 1.43; 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.77) had higher cure rates compared with antivirus drugs. Most of the trials did not report adverse events, and the safety of CPMs was still uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: Some CPMs showed a potential positive effect for the common cold on cure rate. However, due to the poor methodology quality and the defects in the clinical design of the included RCTs, such as the lack of placebo controlled trials, the inappropriate comparison intervention and outcome measurement, the confirmative conclusions on the beneficial effect of CPMs for the common cold could not be drawn.","Chen, Wei; Liu, Bo; Wang, Li-qiong; Ren, Jun; Liu, Jian-ping",BMC Complement Altern Med,633,9

The total GMT was 1:163.7 (95% CI, 128.5 to 208.6), and the antibody level was highest during day 31-40 since onset, and then decreased slightly. Individual differences in changes of antibody levels were observed among 8 representative convalescent patients. In multivariate GEE analysis, patients at age of 31-60 and 61-84 had a higher antibody level than those at age of 16-30 (β=1.0518, P=0.0152; β=1.3718, P=0.0020). Patients with a worse clinical classification had a higher antibody titer (β=0.4639, P=0.0227). Conclusions. The neutralizing antibodies were detected even at the early stage of disease, and a significant response showed in convalescent patients. Moreover, changes on antibody levels ware individual specific.","Wang, Xiaoli; Guo, Xianghua; Xin, Qianqian; Pan, Yang; Li, Jing; Chu, Yanhui; Feng, Yingmei; Wang, Quanyi",,633,16

However, the protection of health information in digital/electronic format is an ongoing concern. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine guidance for the protection of health information when using ICT from all 10 of Canada's provincial regulatory colleges for physicians and to discuss the potential policy and service delivery implications. METHOD: A search of the regulatory college websites was conducted, followed by a document analysis (content and thematic). RESULTS: The college website search identified 522 documents;12 of these documents (from 8 of the 10 colleges) met the study criteria. These documents were notable for the considerable variation in the scope and detail of guidance provided across the colleges. CONCLUSION: While the federal-provincial division of powers in Canada enables different jurisdictional approaches to health service delivery and, thus, opportunities for policy learning, this governing structure may also contribute to a lack of incentive for collaboration, leading to an absence of standardised guidance for health information protection when using ICT. This, in turn, may result in unequal and inequitable protection of health information across the provinces. Therefore, a macro-level approach to policy development in this area may hold the greatest promise for enhancing the protection of health information and doing so in a more standardised manner in countries with federal systems of governance.","Barr, N.

Among the gaps in research on the COVID-19 outbreak, there is a lack of sufficient infoveillance data. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to increase understanding of public awareness of COVID-19 pandemic trends and uncover meaningful themes of concern posted by Twitter users in the English language during the pandemic. METHODS: Data mining was conducted on Twitter to collect a total of 107,990 tweets related to COVID-19 between December 13 and March 9, 2020. The analyses included frequency of keywords, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling to identify and explore discussion topics over time. A natural language processing approach and the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm were used to identify the most common tweet topics as well as to categorize clusters and identify themes based on the keyword analysis. RESULTS: The results indicate three main aspects of public awareness and concern regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. First, the trend of the spread and symptoms of COVID-19 can be divided into three stages. Second, the results of the sentiment analysis showed that people have a negative outlook toward COVID-19. Third, based on topic modeling, the themes relating to COVID-19 and the outbreak were divided into three categories: the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, how to control COVID-19, and reports on COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Sentiment analysis and topic modeling can produce useful information about the trends in the discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic on social media as well as alternative perspectives to investigate the COVID-19 crisis, which has created considerable public awareness. This study shows that Twitter is a good communication channel for understanding both public concern and public awareness about COVID-19. These findings can help health departments communicate information to alleviate specific public concerns about the disease.","Boon-Itt, Sakun; Skunkan, Yukolpat",JMIR Public Health Surveill,633,1

Due to their universal involvements, understanding the nature and also the potential therapeutic uses of these nanovesicles requires innovative experimental approaches in virtually every field. Of the EV group, exosome nanovesicles and larger companion micro vesicles can mediate completely new biologic and clinical processes dependent on the intercellular transfer of proteins and most importantly selected RNAs, particularly miRNAs between donor and targeted cells to elicit epigenetic alterations inducing functional cellular changes. These recipient acceptor cells are nearby (paracrine transfers) or far away after distribution via the circulation (endocrine transfers). The major properties of such vesicles seem to have been conserved over eons, suggesting that they may have ancient evolutionary origins arising perhaps even before cells in the primordial soup from which life evolved. Their potential ancient evolutionary attributes may be responsible for the ability of some modern-day exosomes to withstand unusually harsh conditions, perhaps due to unique membrane lipid compositions. This is exemplified by ability of the maternal milk exosomes to survive passing the neonatal acid/enzyme rich stomach. It is postulated that this resistance also applies to their durable presence in phagolysosomes, thus suggesting a unique intracellular release of their contained miRNAs. A major discussed issue is the generally poorly realized superiority of these naturally evolved nanovesicles for therapies when compared to human-engineered artificial nanoparticles, e.g., for the treatment of diseases like cancers.","Askenase, Phillip W.",Int J Mol Sci,633,1

The detection of advanced fibrosis (METAVIR F≥3) is important to identify patients who are in urgent need of antiviral treatments versus those whose treatment could be deferred (F≥2). The aim was to assess the diagnostic value of PTX3 as a potential biomarker for clinically significant and advanced fibrosis. PTX3 associations with biochemical and histological parameters of inflammatory activity and fibrosis were investigated in 138 patients with chronic viral hepatitis C (HCV) before antiviral treatment. METAVIR histological scores of activity and fibrosis were obtained. PTX3 was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The diagnostic accuracy of serum PTX3 levels was compared to that of other fibrosis markers, including transforming growth factor‐β(1) (TGF-β(1)), hyaluronic acid (HA), aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index (APRI), fibrosis score based on four factors (FIB4), gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase to platelet ratio (GPR), and the liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography (FibroScan®). In HCV patients the PTX3 level increased in parallel with the METAVIR histological score of activity, being independently associated with the METAVIR fibrosis score (P < 0.001). Using the receiver operating characteristics analysis, the best marker for detecting F≥2 and F≥3 was PTX3 with AUC = 0.802 and AUC = 0.867, respectively. The area under the curve of PTX3 for predicting significant fibrosis (F≥2) was significantly greater than those for the GPR ratio (AUC = 0.648) and FIB-4 score (AUC = 0.770) and similar to that for APRI index (AUC = 0.831).

Reason for treatment and antimicrobial drug use (AMU) were described using data collected during the calving season (January 1 to June 30, 2002). The study included 28,573 calves and 36,634 cows and heifers from 203 beef herds. All herds had more than 50 cows. Individual animal treatment records and a herd-level standardized questionnaire were collected from every herd. During the period of January 1 to June 30, 2002 at least one treatment was reported in 14% (95% CI, 11–17) of calves and 2.7% (95% CI, 2.2–3.4) of cows and heifers from these herds. The median percent of calves reported as treated per farm was 6.5% (range 0–100%) while the median percent of cows and heifers reported as treated was 0.9% (range 0–15%). Antimicrobial drugs used during the calving season were primarily for disease treatment rather than prevention or growth promotion. Diarrhea was the primary reason for treating calves and metritis was the primary reason for treating cows. Parenteral antimicrobial drugs were the most common formulation used in both calves and cows. The most commonly used antimicrobial drugs in these herds were tetracyclines, sulphonamides, and florfenicol. This study provides baseline estimates of the frequency of antimicrobial drug exposure, the types of drugs used, and diseases treated in these cow–calf herds. The challenges identified in collecting these data can be used to improve the design of future on-farm studies.","Gow, Sheryl P.; Waldner, Cheryl L.",Prev Vet Med,633,1

We have attempted to explore this issue by using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies specific for the major JHMV glycoprotein (E2) to select sets of neutralization resistant (NR) antigenic variant viruses. Monoclonal antibodies J.7.2 and J.2.2 bind to topographically distinct sites on E2. NR variants selected with J.7.2, like parental JHMV, predominantly cause a fatal encephalitis when given intracerebrally to mice, while J.2.2-selected NR variants cause a subacute disease characterized by paralysis and severe demyelination. We report here that consecutive selection with both J.2.2 and J.7.2 monoclonal antibodies results in NR variants which are markedly attenuated in both encephalitic potential and ability to induce demyelination. Analysis of the different variants suggests that the subregion of E2 bound by monoclonal antibody J.7.2 may be a critical viral determinant of paralysis and demyelination in this model system.","Fleming, J.

Firstly, we use the SIRD epidemic model (S-Susceptible, I-Infected, R-Recovered, D-Dead) which is a non-autonomous dynamic system with incubation time delay to study the evolution of the COVID-19 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province and China Mainland. According to the data in the early stage issued by the National Health Commission of China, we can accurately estimate the parameters of the model, and then accurately predict the evolution of the COVID-19 there. From the analysis of the issued data, we find that the cure rates in Wuhan City, Hubei Province and China Mainland are the approximately linear increasing functions of time t and their death rates are the piecewisely decreasing functions. These can be estimated by finite difference method. Secondly, we use the delayed SIRD epidemic model to study the evolution of the COVID-19 in the Hubei Province outside Wuhan City. We find that its cure rate is an approximately linear increasing function and its death rate is nearly a constant. Thirdly, we use the delayed SIR epidemic model (S-Susceptible, I-Infected, R-Removed) to predict those of Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Anhui Provinces. We find that their cure rates are the approximately linear increasing functions and their death rates are the small constants. The results indicate that it is possible to make accurate long-term predictions for numbers of current confirmed, accumulative dead cases of COVID-19 by modeling. In this paper the results indicate we can accurately obtain and predict the turning points, the end time and the maximum numbers of the current infected and dead cases of the COVID-19 in China.

No randomised controlled trials involving acute exacerbations in children with bronchiectasis have been published to our knowledge. We hypothesised that azithromycin is non-inferior to amoxicillin-clavulanate for resolving exacerbations in children with bronchiectasis. METHODS: We did this parallel-group, double-dummy, double-blind, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial in three Australian and one New Zealand hospital between April, 2012, and August, 2016. We enrolled children aged 1–19 years with radiographically proven bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis. At the start of an exacerbation, children were randomly assigned to oral suspensions of either amoxicillin–clavulanate (22·5 mg/kg, twice daily) and placebo or azithromycin (5 mg/kg per day) and placebo for 21 days. We used permuted block randomisation (stratified by age, site, and cause) with concealed allocation. The primary outcome was resolution of exacerbation (defined as a return to baseline) by 21 days in the per-protocol population, with a non-inferiority margin of −20%. We assessed several secondary outcomes including duration of exacerbation, time to next exacerbation, laboratory, respiratory, and quality-of-life measurements, and microbiology. This trial was registered with the Australian/New Zealand Registry (ACTRN12612000010897). FINDINGS: We screened 604 children and enrolled 236. 179 children had an exacerbation and were assigned to treatment: 97 to amoxicillin–clavulanate, 82 to azithromycin). By day 21, 61 (84%) of 73 exacerbations had resolved in the azithromycin group versus 73 (84%) of 87 in the amoxicillin–clavulanate group. The risk difference showed non-inferiority (−0·3%, 95% CI −11·8 to 11·1). Exacerbations were significantly shorter in the amoxicillin–clavulanate group than in the azithromycin group (median 10 days [IQR 6–15] vs 14 days [8–16]; p=0·014). Adverse events were attributed to the trial medication in 17 (21%) of 82 children in the azithromycin group versus 23 (24%) of 97 in the amoxicillin–clavulanate group (relative risk 0·9, 95% CI 0·5 to 1·5). INTERPRETATION: By 21 days of treatment, azithromycin is non-inferior to amoxicillin–clavulanate for resolving exacerbations in children with non-severe bronchiectasis. In some patients, such as those with penicillin hypersensitivity or those likely to have poor adherence, azithromycin provides another option for treating exacerbations, but must be balanced with risk of treatment failure (within a 20% margin), longer exacerbation duration, and the risk of inducing macrolide resistance.

However, individual patients vary in their responses to bleomycin. The identification of genetic differences that underlie this response variation could improve treatment outcomes by tailoring bleomycin dosages to each patient. We used the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans to identify genetic determinants of bleomycin-response differences by performing linkage mapping on recombinants derived from a cross between the laboratory strain (N2) and a wild strain (CB4856). This approach identified a small genomic region on chromosome V that underlies bleomycin-response variation. Using near-isogenic lines and strains with CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletions and allele replacements, we discovered that a novel nematode-specific gene (scb-1) is required for bleomycin resistance. Although the mechanism by which this gene causes variation in bleomycin responses is unknown, we suggest that a rare variant present in the CB4856 strain might cause differences in the potential stress-response function of scb-1 between the N2 and CB4856 strains, thereby leading to differences in bleomycin resistance.","Brady, Shannon C.; Zdraljevic, Stefan; Bisaga, Karol W.; Tanny, Robyn E.; Cook, Daniel E.; Lee, Daehan; Wang, Ye; Andersen, Erik C.",bioRxiv,633,26

Predictors for severe COVID-19 infection have not been well defined. Determination of risk factors for severe infection would enable identifying patients who may benefit from aggressive supportive care and early intervention. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of 197 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to a tertiary academic medical center. RESULTS: Of 197 hospitalized patients, the mean (SD) age of the cohort was 60.6 (16.2) years, 103 (52.3%) were male and 156 (82.1%) were black. Severe COVID-19 infection was noted in 74 (37.6%) patients, requiring intubation. Patients aged above 60 were significantly more likely to have severe infection. Patients with severe infection were significantly more likely to have diabetes, renal disease, chronic pulmonary disease and had significantly higher white blood cell counts, lower lymphocyte counts, and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to patients with non-severe infection. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, risk factors for severe infection included pre-existing renal disease (odds ratio [OR], 7.4; 95% CI 2.5-22.0), oxygen requirement at hospitalization (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3-6.7), acute renal injury (OR, 2.7; 95% CI 1.3-5.6) and initial CRP (OR,1.006; 95% CI, 1.001-1.01).

Recently, the role of frailty status in adverse clinical outcomes for COVID-19-infected patients has received increasing attention with controversial results. Hence, we will conduct a comprehensive dose–response meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate the association between frailty status and adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The researchers will systematically search PubMed, EMBase, Cochrane Library, ISI Knowledge via Web of Science and MedRxiv or BioRxiv databases (from inception until December 2020) to identify all retrospective and prospective cohort studies. All-cause mortality during hospitalisation will be set as the primary outcome. Univariable or multivariable meta-regression and subgroup analyses will be conducted for the comparison between frail versus non-frail categories. Sensitivity analyses will be used to assess the robustness of our results by removing each included study one at a time to obtain and evaluate the remaining overall estimates of all-cause mortality. To conduct a dose–response meta-analysis for the potential linear or restricted cubic spline regression relationship between frailty status and all-cause mortality, studies with three or more categories will be included.

The ARTIC.v3 primer pool that amplifies short amplicons in a multiplex-PCR reaction is one of the most widely used methods for sequencing the SARS-CoV-2 genome. We observed that some genomic intervals are poorly captured with ARTIC primers. To improve the genomic coverage and variant detection across these intervals, we designed long amplicon primers and evaluated the performance of a short (ARTIC) plus long amplicon (MRL) sequencing approach. Sequencing assays were optimized on VR-1986D-ATCC RNA followed by sequencing of nasopharyngeal swab specimens from five COVID-19 positive patients. ARTIC data covered >90% of the virus genome fraction in the positive control and four of the five patient samples. Variant analysis in the ARTIC data detected 67 mutations, including 66 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and one deletion in ORF10. Of 66 SNVs, five were present in the spike gene, including nt22093 (M177I), nt23042 (S494P), nt23403 (D614G), nt23604 (P681H), and nt23709 (T716I). The D614G mutation is a common variant that has been shown to alter the fitness of SARS-CoV-2. Two spike protein mutations, P681H and T716I, which are represented in the B.1.1.7 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, were also detected in one patient. Long-amplicon data detected 58 variants, of which 70% were concordant with ARTIC data. Combined analysis of ARTIC +MRL data revealed 22 mutations that were either ambiguous (17) or not called at all (5) in ARTIC data due to poor sequencing coverage. For example, a common mutation in the ORF3a gene at nt25907 (G172V) was missed by the ARTIC assay. Hybrid data analysis improved sequencing coverage overall and identified 59 high confidence mutations for phylogenetic analysis. Thus, we show that while the short amplicon (ARTIC) assay provides good genomic coverage with high throughput, complementation of poorly captured intervals with long amplicon data can significantly improve SARS-CoV-2 genomic coverage and variant detection.","Arana, C.; Liang, C.; Brock, M.; Zhang, B.; Zhou, J.; Chen, L.; Cantarel, B.; SoRelle, J.; Hooper, L.

In some cases, infection may be just one biological event that occurs during a multievent process that develops sequentially, over time, and involves genetic and environmental factors that may vary among individuals. Consequently, the role of infectious organisms in the development of human disease may not meet all of the criteria normally required to determine when an organism can be called the cause of a disease. This chapter reviews the expanding role of infections in the development of human disease. We discuss prion diseases of humans, a fascinating example of an infectious disease-causing agent that is not a living organism.

There is little evidence about smoking and risk of infection. We aim to examine association between smoking and COVID-19 infection and subsequent mortality. METHODS: This was a prospective study with participants from the UK Biobank cohort. Participants who lived in England were followed up from 01/02/2020 to 28/06/2020 with data linked to hospital episode statistics, Office for National Statistics and Public Health England PCR tests. We compared current-smokers, previous-smokers with never-smokers and estimated risk ratio (RR) of COVID-19 infection and subsequent mortality using Poisson regression adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index and socio-economic status. Interactions between smoking status and age and sex were tested for using multiplicative interactions, and analyses were stratified by median age (49–68 years, 69–86 years) and sex. RESULTS: In total, 402,978 participants were included in the analyses. The majority were never smokers, 226,294 (56.2%), 140,090 (34.8%) were previous smokers, and 39,974 (9.9%) current smokers. COVID-19 infection was identified in 1591 (0.39%) people, and 372/1591 (23.4%) died. Amongst the younger participants, smokers were nearly twice as likely to become infected with COVID-19 than never smokers (RR 1.88 [1.49–2.38]) whereas there was no difference for those aged 69+ (RR 1.05 [0.82–1.34]). In contrast, amongst the older participants, smokers were twice as likely to die from COVID-19 compared to non-smokers (RR 2.15 [1.11–4.16]) whereas there was no difference for those under the age of 69 (RR 1.22[0.83–1.79]). Similar patterns were observed for previous smokers. The impact of smoking was similar in men and women. CONCLUSION: The association between smoking and COVID-19 infection and subsequent death is modified by age. Smokers and previous smokers aged under 69 were at higher risk of COVID-19 infection, suggesting the risk is associated with increased exposure to SARS-COV-2 virus. Once infected, older smokers were twice as likely to die from COVID-19 than never smokers, possibly mediated by increased risk of chronic conditions/illnesses.","Prats-Uribe, Albert; Xie, Junqing; Prieto-Alhambra, Daniel; Petersen, Irene",Clin Epidemiol,633,1

The estimation of its value with respect to the key threshold of 1.0 is a measure of the need, and eventually effectiveness, of interventions imposed in various countries. Here we present an online tool for the data driven inference and quantification of uncertainties for R0 as well as the time points of interventions for 51 European countries. The study relies on the Bayesian calibration of the simple and well established SIR model with data from reported daily infections. The model is able to fit the data for most countries without individual tuning of parameters. We deploy an open source Bayesian inference framework and efficient sampling algorithms to present a publicly available GUI (https://www.cse-lab.ethz.ch/coronavirus/) that allows the user to assess custom data and compare predictions for pairs of European countries. The results provide a ranking based on the rate of the disease's spread suggesting a metric for the effectiveness of social distancing measures.

In this review article, we highlight the advances, made over several decades, on the procedures and capacities to facilitate genome editing, manifest with the discovery, characterization, and optimization of the mechanism for processing of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat sequences (CRISPR). The editing molecules in the CRISPR gene modification system behave as molecular scissors, cutting DNA at specific genetic locations. First identified as a natural defense mechanism in bacteria, the CRISPR system has now been extensively modified for use in almost all mammalian cells. In describing each CRISPR mechanistic class, we acknowledge the differences and positive attributes each class has to offer to support editing that allows the creation of gene knockouts, knock-ins, gene tagging, insertions, deletions, and point mutations. Further, we discuss how these editing strategies have shaped the field of DNA repair. Specifically, we provide examples of the utility of CRISPR approaches in furthering our understanding of two of the major DNA repair pathways, namely mismatch repair and base excision repair. ABSTRACT: The earliest methods of genome editing, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFN) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), utilize customizable DNA-binding motifs to target the genome at specific loci. While these approaches provided sequence-specific gene-editing capacity, the laborious process of designing and synthesizing recombinant nucleases to recognize a specific target sequence, combined with limited target choices and poor editing efficiency, ultimately minimized the broad utility of these systems. The discovery of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat sequences (CRISPR) in Escherichia coli dates to 1987, yet it was another 20 years before CRISPR and the CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins were identified as part of the microbial adaptive immune system, by targeting phage DNA, to fight bacteriophage reinfection. By 2013, CRISPR/Cas9 systems had been engineered to allow gene editing in mammalian cells. The ease of design, low cytotoxicity, and increased efficiency have made CRISPR/Cas9 and its related systems the designer nucleases of choice for many. In this review, we discuss the various CRISPR systems and their broad utility in genome manipulation. We will explore how CRISPR-controlled modifications have advanced our understanding of the mechanisms of genome stability, using the modulation of DNA repair genes as examples.","Thompson, Marlo K.; Sobol, Robert W.; Prakash, Aishwarya",Biology (Basel),633,17

METHODS: Upon admission to the emergency room, the inflammation-based risk scoring system was applied and patients were classified as having mild, moderate, or severe inflammation. In-hospital occurrence of thrombosis, need for mechanical ventilation, and death were recorded. RESULTS: One-hundred patients (55 ± 13 years; 71% men) were included and classified as having mild (29%), moderate (12%), or severe (59%) inflammation. The need for mechanical ventilation differed among patients in each group (16%, 50%, and 71%, respectively; P < 0.0001), yielding a 4.1-fold increased risk of requiring mechanical ventilation in patients with moderate inflammation and 5.4 for those with severe inflammation. On the contrary, there were no differences for the occurrence of thrombosis (10%, 8%, and 22%, respectively; P = 0.142) or death (21%, 42%, and 39%, respectively; P = 0.106). In the multivariate analysis, only severe inflammation (hazard ratio [HR] = 4.1), D-dimer > 574 ng/mL (HR = 3.0), and troponin I ≥ 6.7 ng/mL (HR = 2.4) at hospital admission were independent predictors of the need for mechanical ventilation.

Methods: This nationwide prospective cohort study monitors a representative sample of pupils (grade 1-8) and teachers at Austrian schools throughout the school year 2020/2021. We repeatedly test participants for SARS-CoV-2 infection using a gargling solution and RT-PCR. We herein report on the first two rounds of examinations. We used mixed-effect logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and robust 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Findings: We analysed data on 10734 participants from 245 schools (9465 pupils, 1269 teachers).

To understanding the epidemiological role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, we utilized an iterative empirical process in Geographic Information System (GIS) to identify and qualify potential hotspots for maintenance and circulation of MERS-CoV, and produced risk-based surveillance sites in Kenya. Data on camel population and distribution were used to develop camel density map, while camel farming system was defined using multi-factorial criteria including the agro-ecological zones (AEZs), production and marketing practices. Primary and secondary MERS-CoV seroprevalence data from specific sites were analyzed, and location-based prevalence matching with camel densities was conducted. High-risk convergence points (migration zones, trade routes, camel markets, slaughter slabs) were profiled and frequent cross-border camel movement mapped. Results showed that high camel-dense areas and interaction (markets and migration zones) were potential hotspot for transmission and spread. Cross-border contacts occurred with in-migrated herds at hotspot locations. AEZ differential did not influence risk distribution and plausible risk factors for spatial MERS-CoV hotspots were camel densities, previous cases of MERS-CoV, high seroprevalence and points of camel convergences. Although Kenyan camels are predisposed to MERS-CoV, no shedding is documented to date.

Elderly patients, people with underlying chronic illnesses, cancer patients, and those who are immunocompromised are at higher risk and account for higher mortality rate. Unfortunately, there is no approved medication for treatment, till date, thereby supporting triage management and difficult decision-making. Thus, there should be a substantial increase in the palliative care in times of pandemic. There should be an increase in the availability of palliative care services in different care settings. Due to a surge in the number of cases of COVID-19, it has been reported on how palliative care is being delayed, discontinued, or deprioritized. AIM: The aim of this study is to evaluate the barriers occurring in providing the palliative care to the patients with nonmalignant illness. METHODOLOGY: A questionnaire was designed after studying previous work over palliative care and pandemic crisis and was distributed among the physicians, surgeons, and the residents; a total of 95 health-care workers were involved. The survey was done through mails. The response then was evaluated and analyzed. RESULTS: As seen by the responses we got from the health-care workers, the main issue is the nonavailability of the personal protective equipment during this pandemic. Keeping the current scenario in mind, regarding COVID-19, the patients are at fear of coming to the hospital at first place, and even if they come then the fear of being alone haunts them. One of the biggest fears of the patient is dying alone, without being in contact with their loved ones. CONCLUSION: Palliative care should be an essential part of any health-care service in any humanitarian crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, effort should be made to remove the barriers and provide palliative care to the patient.","Jain, Tanya; Jain, Roopesh",Indian J Palliat Care,633,1

In this study, we demonstrate that the protein is posttranslationally modified by covalent attachment to the small ubiquitin-like modifier. The major sumoylation site was mapped to the (62)lysine residue of the N protein. Further expression and characterization of wild type N protein and K62A mutant reveal that sumoylation of the N protein drastically promotes its homo-oligomerization, and plays certain roles in the N protein-mediated interference of host cell division.

Patients were divided into 3 groups according to their comorbidities: hypertension, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. We then identified the molecular alterations associated with these comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. Results Patients with only hypertension showed higher levels of inflammatory genes and B-cell related genes when compared to those with T2D and obesity. However, the levels of IFN-gamma, IL22, and CD274 (a ligand that binds to receptor PD1) were higher in COVID-19 patients with T2D and obesity.

The purpose of this guideline is to serve a reference in the hospital for specialists so that they may better diagnose cases and provide effective therapies and proposed antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs for patients.","Li, Yuping; Tahamtani, Yaser; Totonchi, Mehdi; Chen, Chengshui; Hashemian, Seyed Mohammad Reza; Amoozegar, Fatemeh; Zhang, Jin-San; Gholampour, Yousef; Li, Xiaokun",Cell J,633,16

The present work aimed to analyze the differences in the scores of the Adolescents’ Food Habits Checklist (AFHC) before and during the pandemic in the Polish Adolescents’ COVID-19 Experience (PLACE-19) Study population. The PLACE-19 Study was conducted during the pandemic among a population of 2448 students recruited from secondary schools in all regions of Poland using a random quota sampling. The participants were required to complete an AFHC consisting of 23 items pertaining to food purchase, preparation, and consumption habits. Current habits (during the pandemic) and previous habits were assessed and scored separately. The total (p = 0.001), purchase (p < 0.001), and consumption scores (p = 0.014) indicated that the AFHC scores during the pandemic were higher than before. For questions on purchase habits, a lower number of respondents reported eating in a restaurant, eating takeaway meals, having lunch away from home, or buying pastries, cakes or crisps. For questions on preparation habits, an greater number of respondents reported that they usually avoided eating fried food and tried to keep their overall sugar intake down, but fewer respondents said they tried to have low-fat desserts. For questions on consumption habits, a lower number of respondents reported that they usually ate a dessert or pudding if one were available and a larger number said they made sure to eat at least one serving of vegetables or salad a day and at least three servings of fruit most days. Based on the obtained results, it may be stated that although there was an increase in the AFHC scores during the pandemic, a similar share of respondents showed improved or worsened food habits, and a similar share changed their food habits from healthy to unhealthy and from unhealthy to healthy. At the same time, a majority of changes were associated with purchase habits, which were probably forced by lockdowns and the resultant restrictions in eating out or grocery shopping.","Skolmowska, Dominika; Głąbska, Dominika; Guzek, Dominika",Nutrients,633,28

METHODS: This ecological study of dengue, chikungunya, zika, and COVID-19 was performed from January 1 to July 31, 2020. RESULTS: Espírito Santo registered 44,614, 8,092, 3,138, and 91,483 cases of dengue, chikungunya, zika, and COVID-19, respectively (January-July, 2020). In the 27 and four municipalities with a high incidence of dengue and chikungunya, respectively, the incidence of COVID-19 was 647.0-3,721.7 and 1,787.2-3,403.0 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Espírito Santo experienced an overlap of epidemics, especially in urban areas.","Vicente, Creuza Rachel; da Silva, Theresa Cristina Cardoso; Pereira, Larissa Dell’Antonio; Miranda, Angelica E.",Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical,633,13

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the associations between serum albumin concentrations and COVID-19 disease severity and adverse outcomes. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, from inception to October 30, 2020. Sixty-seven studies in 19,760 COVID-19 patients (6141 with severe disease or poor outcome) were selected for analysis. Pooled results showed that serum albumin concentrations were significantly lower in patients with severe disease or poor outcome (standard mean difference, SMD: − 0.99 g/L; 95% CI, − 1.11 to − 0.88, p < 0.001). In multivariate meta-regression analysis, age (t = − 2.13, p = 0.043), publication geographic area (t = 2.16, p = 0.040), white blood cell count (t = − 2.77, p = 0.008) and C-reactive protein (t = − 2.43, p = 0.019) were significant contributors of between-study variance. Therefore, lower serum albumin concentrations are significantly associated with disease severity and adverse outcomes in COVID-19 patients. The assessment of serum albumin concentrations might assist with early risk stratification and selection of appropriate care pathways in this group.","Paliogiannis, Panagiotis; Mangoni, Arduino Aleksander; Cangemi, Michela; Fois, Alessandro Giuseppe; Carru, Ciriaco; Zinellu, Angelo",Clin Exp Med,633,16
