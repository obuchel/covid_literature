60665,60665,60665,[Chemotherapy strategy for colorectal cancer under the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia].,15.806619,13.464507,2020-02-26,"Repurposed drugs are now considered as attractive therapeutics against COVID-19. It is shown that Remdesivir, a nucleoside drug that was originally invented for the Ebola virus, is effective in suppressing the replication of SARS-CoV-2 that causes COVID-19. Similarly, Galidesivir, Favipiravir, Ribavirin, N4-hydroxycytidine (EIDD-1931), and EIDD-2801 (a prodrug of EIDD-1931) were also found to be effective against COVID-19. However, the mechanisms of action of these drugs are not yet fully understood. For example, in some experimental studies, these drugs were proposed to act as a RNA-chain terminator, while in other studies, these were proposed to induce base-pair mutations above the error catastrophe limit to stall the replication of the viral RNA. To understand the mutagenic effects of these drugs, the role of different tautomers in their base-pairing abilities is studied here in detail by employing a reliable dispersion-corrected density functional theoretic method. It is found that Remdesivir and Galidesivir can adopt both amino and imino tautomeric conformations to base-pair with RNA bases. While the insertions of G and U are preferred against the amino tautomers of these drugs, the insertion of C is mainly possible against the imino tautomers. However, although Favipiravir and Ribavirin can make stable base pair interactions by using their keto and enol tautomers, the formation of the latter pairs would be less probable due to the endothermic nature of the products. Interestingly, the insertions of all of the RNA bases are found to be possible against the keto tautomer of Favipiravir, while the keto tautomer of Ribavirin has a clear preference for G. Remarkably, due to the negligible difference in the stability of EIDD-2801 and EIDD-1931, these tautomers would coexist in the biological environment. The insertion of G is found to be preferred against EIDD-1931 and the incorporations of U, A, and G are preferred opposite EIDD-2801. These findings suggest that base-pair mutations are the main causes of the antiviral properties of these drugs.","Jena, N R",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,847,31

In Spain, since the government declared the state of alarm on 14 March 2020, doctors responsible for carrying out neurophysiological tests have been performing them without any consensus criterion or clear safety guidelines for doctors, technicians or patients. The following recommendations, based on current knowledge of the disease and therefore liable to change in the future, are proposed when the pandemic appears to have entered a process of decreasing virulence and, with it, the strict containment measures established to date. However, in view of the possibility of a second wave of the pandemic, it seems necessary to establish basic and minimum recommendations to respect the patient's right to appropriate care, similar to that provided prior to the pandemic, and to maintain minimum safety standards for the patients themselves and for the doctors, technicians and health personnel carrying out these tests. These recommendations concern the constitution of a priority based on the reason for consultation, the establishment of calls to check the patient's clinical situation before going to the outpatient department and the rules for carrying out neurophysiological tests, which are generally based on the preservation of hospital circuits, respect for and observation of the known barriers to contagion of this disease, and the use of disposable material. These recommendations are of particular interest, especially given the uncertainty of not knowing the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the coming weeks or months.","Fernández-Sánchez, V E; Martínez-Martínez, M A; Taramundi-Argüeso, S; Pérez-Lorensu, P J",Revista de neurologia,847,23

The Harmonic Focus could outperform electrocautery in dissection of axillary lymph nodes, resulting in shortening of the operative times and minimize postoperative complications. This study aims to compare the mean axillary drain production and the axillary numbness frequency in axillary lymph node dissection (ANLD) during Modified Radical Mastectomy (MRM) and breast conservative surgery (BCS) between the use of harmonics scalpel and electrocautery. Methods This study includes 40 patients presented with early breast cancer (T1 and T2) underwent BCS or MRM in general surgery department, Faculty of Medicine, Benha University Hospital during the period from January 2017 to September 2019. The patients randomly assigned into 2 groups; group A: subjected to ANLD using Harmonic Focus tool and group B: subjected to ANLD using electrocautery. Operative time, total drainage volume, blood loss, duration of the drain and frequency of axillary numbness were recorded. Results This study shows that using Harmonic in axillary dissection considerably reduced operating time, total drainage volume, blood loss, days of hospital stays and reduced axillary numbness level in comparison to conventional electrocautery. Conclusion Compared to the normal electrocautery, the harmonic focus dissection has major advantages in lowering postoperative drainage, blood loss intra-operative and lower incidence of axillary numbness in breast cancer axillary dissection, without affecting operating time.","Salama, Ahmed M F; Nawar, Ahmed M; Zayed, Mohamed E; Essa, Mohamed S",Annals of medicine and surgery,847,16

However, its terpene synthases (TPS), which act as metabolic gatekeepers in the biosynthesis of volatile terpenoids, remain to be characterized. Auto-Headspace Solid-phase Microextraction/GC-MS analysis of floral volatile terpene constituents from seven sweet pea cultivars identified α-bergamotene, linalool, (-)-α-cubebene, geraniol, β-caryophyllene and β-sesquiphellandrene as the dominant compounds. RNA sequencing was performed to profile the transcriptome of Lathyrus odoratus flowers. Bioinformatic analysis identified eight TPS genes (acronymed as LoTPS) that were successfully cloned, heterologously expressed and functionally analyzed. LoTPS4 and LoTPS7, belonging to the TPS-b clade, biochemically catalyzed the formation of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. LoTPS3 and LoTPS8, placed in the TPS-a clade, also generated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, while LoTPS12 belonging to the TPS-g clade showed linalool/nerolidol synthase activity. Notably, biochemical assays of the recombinant LoTPS proteins revealed their catalytic promiscuity, and the enzymatic products were basically consistent with major volatile compounds released from sweet pea flowers.

METHOD The case notes for 11 patients with adult Hirschsprung's disease, treated operatively between January 1986 and December 2007, were reviewed and data on preoperative diagnosis, operative procedures and postoperative complications were retrieved. RESULTS Diagnosis was by open rectal biopsy in nine patients and by rectal suction biopsy in two patients. The time taken for preoperative bowel preparation ranged from 10 to 35 days, and colostomy was required in three patients to facilitate bowel cleansing. The Soave and Swenson procedures were used in six and five patients, respectively, leading to anastomotic stricture in one patient treated using the Soave procedure and to leakage in two patients treated using the Swenson procedure. All procedures took longer than 300 min, and 300-800 ml of blood or plasma was transfused. CONCLUSION Therapeutic procedures for adult Hirschsprung's disease may result in life-threatening anastamotic complications.

Fertility is the proportional gametic contribution of parents to their progeny. An effective number of parents, derivative of effective population size, is the probability that two alleles randomly chosen from the gamete gene pool originated from the same parent. The effective number of parents is directly related to the fertility variation among parents, which should be monitored for manipulating gene diversity of seed crops. We formulated a fundamental equation of estimating the effective number of parents and applied it to a seed production population. RESULTS Effective number of parents (Np) was derived from fertility variation (Ψ) considering covariance (correlation coefficient, r) between maternal and paternal fertility. The Ψ was calculated from the coefficient of variation in reproductive outputs and divided into female (ψf) and male (ψm) fertility variation in the population under study. The Np was estimated from the parental Ψ estimated by the fertility variation of maternal (ψf) and paternal (ψm) parents. The gene diversity of seed crops was monitored by Ψ and Np. in a 1.5 generation Pinus koraiensis seed orchard as a case of monoecious species. A large variation of female and male strobili production was observed among the studied 52 parents over four consecutive years, showing statistically significant differences across all studied years. Parental balance curve showed greater distortion in paternal than maternal parents. The Ψ ranged from 1.879 to 4.035 with greater ψm than ψf, and the Np varied from 14.8 to 36.8. When pooled, the relative effective number of parents was improved as 80.0% of the census number. CONCLUSIONS We recommend the use of fertility variation (i.e., CV, Ψ), Person's product-moment correlation (r), and effective number of parents (Np) as tools for gauging gene diversity of seed crops in production populations. For increasing Np and gene diversity, additional management options such as mixing seed-lots, equal cone harvest and application of supplemental-mass-pollination are recommended.","Park, Ji-Min; Kang, Hye-In; Yeom, Da-Bin; Kang, Kyu-Suk; El-Kassaby, Yousry A; Lee, Kyung-Mi",BMC plant biology,847,1

Endovascular glue embolization with N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) is an accepted form of treatment. The reported complication rates vary widely from 2% to 15%, and timing of polymerization appears to play a major role. Additionally, the interaction between NBCA and vessel surface as well as the presence of biological catalysts are poorly understood. METHODS Polymerization time was measured for mixtures of Lipiodol/NBCA of 50/50, 70/30, and 60/40. The influence of pH, temperature, and the presence of biological catalysts on polymerization time was investigated. Contact angles were measured on polyvinyl alcohol cryogel (PVA-C), silicone, and endothelial surfaces in a submerged aqueous environment to assess physical surface interactions. High speed video analysis of glue injection through a microcatheter was performed to characterize simulated coaxial flow. RESULTS NBCA polymerization rate increased with pH and temperature. A hydrophilic surface such as PVA-C was better than silicone at mimicking the physical properties of endothelium. Live endothelium provided a catalytic surface that at least doubled the rate of polymerization. Blood products further increased the polymerization rate in the following order (slowest to fastest): plasma, platelets, red blood cells (RBCs), and lysed RBCs. These factors could explain the discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo results reported in the current literature. High speed video analysis of NBCA injection showed dripping to jetting transition with significant wall effect which deviated from previous ideal assumptions. CONCLUSIONS The determinants of NBCA polymerization rate are multifactorial and dependent mainly on the presence of biological catalysts coupled with flow related wall interaction.","Wang, Bill H; Boulton, Melfort; Lee, Donald H; Pelz, David M; Lownie, Stephen P",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,847,1

Misdiagnosis can lead to untreated symptoms, incorrect treatment and avoidable deaths. The best combination of clinical features and tests to achieve a diagnosis of asthma is unclear. As asthma is usually diagnosed in non-specialist settings, a clinical prediction model to aid the assessment of the probability of asthma in primary care may improve diagnostic accuracy. We aimed to identify and describe existing prediction models to support the diagnosis of asthma in children and adults in primary care. We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, TRIP and US National Guidelines Clearinghouse databases from 1 January 1990 to 23 November 17. We included prediction models designed for use in primary care or equivalent settings to aid the diagnostic decision-making of clinicians assessing patients with symptoms suggesting asthma. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts for eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. From 13,798 records, 53 full-text articles were reviewed. We included seven modelling studies; all were at high risk of bias. Model performance varied, and the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve ranged from 0.61 to 0.82. Patient-reported wheeze, symptom variability and history of allergy or allergic rhinitis were associated with asthma. In conclusion, clinical prediction models may support the diagnosis of asthma in primary care, but existing models are at high risk of bias and thus unreliable for informing practice. Future studies should adhere to recognised standards, conduct model validation and include a broader range of clinical data to derive a prediction model of value for clinicians.","Daines, Luke; McLean, Susannah; Buelo, Audrey; Lewis, Steff; Sheikh, Aziz; Pinnock, Hilary",NPJ primary care respiratory medicine,847,11

Here, we summarized the clinical features, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients based on our clinical practice. Methods The clinical and imaging findings, treatments, and follow-up data of 471 patients with COVID-19 who were discharged from the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital prior to February 6, 2020, were retrospectively analyzed. Results Among these patients, there were 2 mild cases, 282 moderate cases, 181 severe cases, and 6 critical cases. There were 250 males and 221 females aged 17 to 90 years. The median age was 54 years in the severe/critical group, which was significantly older than in the mild/moderate group (P<0.05). 44.59% of them had one or more underlying diseases. The most common symptoms were fever, cough, expectoration, and dyspnea. The median body temperature in the severe/critical group was 39°C, which was significantly higher than in the mild/moderate group (P<0.05). The incidences of lymphopenia and CD4+ T lymphocytopenia were 53.5% and 41.86%, respectively. Ground-glass opacity and small patchy shadows were the most common findings on chest computed tomography (CT). Compared with the mild/moderate group, the severe/critical group showed higher proportions of severe lymphocytopenia and CD4+ T lymphocytopenia, along with more ground-glass shadows and large-scale consolidation. After anti-infection, oxygen therapy, and symptomatic support, lymphocytes and CD4+ T lymphocytes were markedly increased, all patients were discharged. The median time of nucleic acid conversion and hospital stay were 9 and 12 days, respectively, which were significantly longer in the severe/critical group than in the mild/moderate group. Of the 390 cases followed, only 19 were hospitalized again due to other diseases. All patients recovered well from COVID-19, with negative nucleic acid test results. Conclusions Lymphocytopenia and CD4+ T lymphocytopenia were found to be associated with COVID-19 and thus may be important indicators in evaluating the severity and prognosis.

However, their role in patients with brain metastases, which affects over 20% of patients and cause significant morbidity, is less clear. METHODS We reviewed patients with EGFR/ALK wild-type mNSCLC with CNS metastases. Serial MRIs were reviewed to determine the time to intracranial progression (iPFS). Multivariate regression was performed to adjust for the disease-specific graded prognostic score (ds-GPA). RESULTS We identified 36 ICI- and 33 chemotherapy-treated patients with baseline CNS metastases and available serial MRIs (average frequency:3.5 months). Baseline radiation was given except for 2 chemotherapy-treated patients with asymptomatic solitary metastasis. The CNS burden of disease was higher in the ICI-treated group (ICI:22% vs. chemotherapy:0% had >10 lesions; p = 0.02), but the utilization of WBRT was not (ICI:31% vs. chemotherapy:45%; p = 0.09). At the time of progression, CNS involvement was identified in 30 % of ICI-treated patients compared to 64 % of chemotherapy controls (p = 0.02). ICI-treated patients had superior iPFS (13.5 vs 8.4 months) that remained significant in multivariate analysis (HR 1.9; 95%CI 1.1--3.4).

METHODS Following a brief didactic session, 45 volunteer doctors inexperienced with airway management, attempted to intubate a manikin using a Macintosh laryngoscope and Glidescope(®) with uninterrupted and without chest compressions. Primary endpoints were intubation times and success rate with each device. Dental compression and level of self-confidence in using each device were also assessed. RESULTS In the scenario without chest compressions the cumulative success rate related to time to intubation was significantly higher with the Macintosh blade than with the Glidescope(®) (p<0.001). On the contrary, in the scenario with continuous chest compressions, the cumulative rate related to time to intubation was significantly higher with the Glidescope(®) (p=0.035). Significantly fewer attempts were required for the first successful intubation with the Macintosh blade in the non-CPR scenario versus the CPR scenario (p=0.007). Moreover, the number of attempts for the first successful intubation was significantly lower for the Glidescope(®) in the non-CPR (p=0.001) and the CPR scenario (p<0.001). Dental compression was significantly lower with the Glidescope(®) in both scenarios (p<0.001).

METHODS The authors performed a retrospective review of all ASD patients who underwent 3CO during the period from 2006 to 2019. All cases involved either isolated sagittal deformity (patients underwent standard PSO) or concurrent sagittal-coronal deformity (coronal vertical axis [CVA] ≥ 4.0 cm; patients underwent APSO).

There were no significant differences between PSO and APSO patients in rates of complications (overall 33.7% vs 42.3%, p = 0.227; neurological 5.9% vs 3.9%, p = 0.547; medical 20.7% vs 25.0%, p = 0.482; and surgical 6.5% vs 11.5%, p = 0.191, respectively). However, the APSO group required significantly longer stays in the ICU (3.1 vs 2.3 days, p = 0.047) and hospital (10.8 vs 8.3 days, p = 0.002). At the 2-year follow-up, there were no significant differences in mechanical complications, including proximal junctional kyphosis (p = 0.352), pseudarthrosis (p = 0.980), rod fracture (p = 0.852), and reoperation (p = 0.600). CONCLUSIONS ASD patients with significant coronal imbalance often have severe concurrent sagittal deformity. APSO is a powerful and effective technique to achieve multiplanar correction without higher risk of morbidity and complications compared with PSO for sagittal imbalance. However, APSO is associated with slightly longer ICU and hospital stays.","Lau, Darryl; Haddad, Alexander F; Deviren, Vedat; Ames, Christopher P",Journal of neurosurgery. Spine,847,1

METHODS A simulation model was applied based on a local data set of subsidies and retail prices (2007-2016), data on own-price elasticity estimates, and representative nutritional and health surveys. We estimated marginal obesity prevalence and population attributable fraction to assess the potential impact of the butter, cheese, and sugar subsidies intervention. RESULTS The intervention was predicted to avoid 10 363 obese adults over the study period, because of the reduction of the obesity prevalence by -0.7 percentage points. Overall, the predicted effect was largest in elderly and male groups, although females with a low socioeconomic status experienced the greatest decrease in the prevalence. The population attributable fraction predicted that 4.0% of population with obesity were attributable to the existence of these subsidies. CONCLUSIONS This analysis provides policy makers with the predicted impact on obesity of the butter, cheese, and sugar subsidies disposal, enabling them to incorporate this health impact into decision making across policy areas in the economic and health field. This study aims to model the potential impact on obesity of removing industrial subsidies for butter, cheese and sugar in the Canary Islands.","Rodríguez-Mireles, Silvia; López-Valcárcel, Beatriz G; Serra-Majem, Lluís",Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,847,1

Residual P. acnes is found on the skin up to 29% of the time immediately after surgical skin preparation and in 70% of dermal biopsy specimens. These residual bacteria may be a source for infection. Identifying more ideal skin preparation may help reduce the risk of infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect that topical benzoyl peroxide (BPO), with chlorhexidine skin preparation, would have on the presence of P. acnes cultured at the time of shoulder surgery. We hypothesized that adding topical BPO to our skin preparation would reduce the number of positive P. acnes cultures identified during surgery. METHODS Fifty patients undergoing first-time shoulder surgery were treated with topical 5% BPO cream 48 hours before surgery. After skin preparation, 13 samples per subject were obtained. Cultures were held for 14 days. RESULTS Fifty patients underwent arthroscopic shoulder surgery; 650 culture specimens were obtained. The skin was positive at the initiation of surgery in 6% of cases. Tissue samples were positive in 6%. The skin was positive in 10% at the end of surgery. None of these rates of positive culture were different from the 4% rate observed with a control swab. CONCLUSION Application of BPO is an effective way to reduce P. acnes on skin at the beginning and, importantly, at the end of a surgical procedure. This may result in a lower risk for postoperative infection.","Sabetta, James R; Rana, Vishal P; Vadasdi, Katherine B; Greene, R Timothy; Cunningham, James G; Miller, Seth R; Sethi, Paul M",Journal of shoulder and elbow surgery,847,12

Prehospital and transport settings require fluid warmers to be small, energy efficient and independent of external power supply. We compared the warming properties and resistance to flow of currently available battery-operated fluid warmers. METHODS Fluid warming was evaluated at 50, 100 and 200 mL/min at a constant input temperature of 20°C and 10°C using a cardiopulmonary bypass roller pump and cooler. Output temperature was continuously recorded. RESULTS Performance of fluid warmers varied with flows and input temperatures. At an input temperature of 20°C and flow of 50 mL/min, the Buddy Lite, enFlow, Thermal Angel and Warrior warmed 3.4, 2.4, 1 and 3.6 L to over 35°C, respectively. However, at an input temperature of 10°C and flow of 200 mL/min, the Buddy Lite failed to warm, the enFlow warmed 3.3 L to 25.7°C, the Thermal Angel warmed 1.5 L to 20.9°C and the Warrior warmed 3.4 L to 34.4°C (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION We found significant differences between the fluid warmers: the use of the Buddy Lite should be limited to moderate input temperature and low flow rates. The use of the Thermal Angel is limited to low volumes due to battery capacity and low output temperature at extreme conditions. The Warrior provides the best warming performance at high infusion rates, as well as low input temperatures, and was able to warm the largest volumes in these conditions.","Lehavi, Amit; Yitzhak, Avraham; Jarassy, Refael; Heizler, Rami; Katz, Yeshayahu Shai; Raz, Aeyal",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,847,16

We sought to estimate the learning curve for laparoscopic TEP repair without supervision. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients scheduled for laparoscopic TEP repair of an inguinal hernia from December 2000 to October 2007. RESULTS We reviewed medical records for 700 patients. The cases were divided into 8 groups: 20 patients each in groups I-V and 200 patients each in groups VI-VIII. No significant difference in demographic characteristics was identified among the groups. The mean duration of surgery significantly decreased (p < 0.001) in relation to experience; it reached a plateau of less than 30 minutes (mean 28 min) after 60 cases. The mean length of stay in hospital was 0.97 days, reaching a plateau after 20 cases. Six patients were converted to other techniques: 1 patient each in groups III and VIII and 4 patients in group VII. Three recurrences were detected; however, 2 were excluded because the patient had bilateral inguinal hernias. CONCLUSION We estimate the learning curve for laparoscopic TEP repair is 60 cases for a beginner surgeon. The presence of an experienced supervisor during the first 60 cases can help prevent unnecessary complications and shorten the duration of surgery.","Choi, Yoon Young; Kim, Zisun; Hur, Kyung Yul",Canadian journal of surgery.

This review elaborates on disorders of the spinal cord caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. OBJECTIVES To review the published data about SARS-CoV-2-associated spinal cord disorders and assess their clinical, neuroimaging, treatment, and prognostic aspects. METHODS The PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched for published cases using the search items ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND myelitis"", ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND myelopathy"", and ""COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND spinal cord"". RESULTS Thirty-three isolated cases were included in the present review, of which 14 were aged 60 years and above (range: 3-70 years). Eighteen patients had lung abnormalities on chest imaging. Eight patients had developed either an areflexic paraparesis or quadriparesis. In 17 patients, neuroimaging demonstrated longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, while 3 cases showed neuroimaging changes in the spinal cord as a part of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis syndrome. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations revealed inflammatory changes in 18 patients. However, the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the CSF was discovered in 2 patients. In 2 patients, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were demonstrated in the CSF. Following treatment, 13 patients were able to walk. CONCLUSIONS A variety of COVID-19-related spinal cord manifestations, such as acute transverse myelitis, acute necrotizing myelitis, SARS-CoV-2 myelitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, hypoxic myelopathy, MOG antibody-associated myelitis, spinal cord infarction, and spinal epidural abscess, have been reported. The possible mechanisms of this involvement being direct invasion, cytokine storm, coagulopathy, and an autoimmune response.

We consider the ways in which soft political factors operate in guideline development processes at NICE such that guidelines are not truly led by science. We suggest that while NICE procedures explicitly incorporate scientific principles and mechanisms, including independent committees and quality assurance, these fail to operate as scientific practices because, for example, decisions may only be challenged through the courts, which regard NICE as a scientific authority. We then examine what the NICE rapid guideline procedure for COVID-19 reveals about the practical reality of claims about the scientific integrity of NICE guidelines. Changes to guideline development processes during the COVID-19 emergency demonstrated how easy it is to undermine the scientific integrity of NICE's decision-making. The cancellation of the guideline programme and the publication of a rapid guideline process specifically to address the COVID-19 pandemic removed scientific checks and balances, including independent committees, stakeholder consultation and quality assurance, demonstrating that the relationship between NICE and the UK government is more complex than a scientific principle truism. We suggest that NICE is not (and indeed cannot be) truly independent of government in practice, nor can it be truly led by science, in part because of its relationship to the state, which it is simultaneously constituted by and constitutive of.","McPherson, S J; Speed, Ewen",BMJ evidence-based medicine,847,1

This study aimed to investigate whether the use of cuffed vs uncuffed tubes is associated with an increased incidence of acute postoperative respiratory complications. METHODS We retrospectively studied all children aged 0-7 years in which the trachea was intubated between September 28, 2006 and August 26, 2016 in a pediatric university hospital. Logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the association between tube design (cuffed vs uncuffed) and the incidence of acute postoperative respiratory complications (stridor, wheezing, or dyspnea; desaturations ≤90%) in need of intervention (epinephrine, dexamethasone, nebulizers, supplementary oxygen, or reintubation), adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS In 5247 of 6796 cases (77%), a cuffed tube was used. Acute postoperative respiratory complications in need of intervention occurred in 334 cases (4.9%) and were less common after cuffed than after uncuffed tubes (N = 236, 4.5% vs N = 98, 6.3%, respectively, odds ratio 0.70; 95%CI 0.55-0.89). Desaturation occurred less often after cuffed tubes (cuffed: N = 1365, 26.0%; uncuffed: N = 512, 33.1%; OR: 0.71 (0.61-0.84)). After adjusting for confounders, there was no difference in acute postoperative respiratory complications between cuffed tubes and uncuffed tubes (OR 0.74; 95%CI 0.55-1.01). Subgroup analyses in various age groups did not show significant differences between the use of cuffed or uncuffed tubes.

METHODS We included in the analysis RCTs and RWSs investigating the use of alemtuzumab in MS in which infective complications were reported, as well as case reports of rare infections. We conducted a meta-analysis of proportions and a random effect model meta-regression to investigate heterogeneity. RESULTS The pooled prevalence of infective complications in alemtuzumab treated MS patients is 24%. The most common reported infections are respiratory tract infections (47%) and the most part of the infections are mild-to-moderate (85%). Severe infections account for 6% of the total estimate.

We examined the relationship between early changes (both increases and decreases) in body weight and blood pressure, and the impact of these changes on subsequent cardiovascular outcome events. SUBJECTS/METHODS A total of 9804 male and female subjects, aged 55 years or older, with a body mass index of 27-45 kg m(-2) were included in this current subanalysis of the SCOUT trial. Subjects were required to have a history of cardiovascular disease and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus with at least one cardiovascular risk factor (hypertension, dyslipidemia, current smoking or diabetic nephropathy) to assess cardiovascular outcomes. Post hoc subgroup analyses of weight change (categories) and blood pressure were performed overall and by treatment group (6-week sibutramine followed by randomized placebo or continued sibutramine). The primary outcome event (POE) was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, resuscitated cardiac arrest or cardiovascular death. Time-to-event analyses of the POE were performed using Cox regression models with factors for treatment, subgroups and interactions. RESULTS During the initial 6-week sibutramine treatment period, systolic blood pressure decreased progressively with increasing weight loss in hypertensive subjects (-8.1±10.5 mm Hg with <5 kg weight loss to -10.8±11.0 mm Hg with ⩾5 kg weight loss). The highest POE incidence occurred mainly in groups with increases in both weight and blood pressure. However, with long-term sibutramine treatment, a markedly lower blood pressure tended to increase POEs. CONCLUSION Modest weight loss and modest lower blood pressure each reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events, as expected. However, the combination of early marked weight loss and rapid blood pressure reduction seems to be harmful in this obese elderly cardiovascular diseased population.","Seimon, R V; Espinoza, D; Ivers, L; Gebski, V; Finer, N; Legler, U F; Sharma, A M; James, W P T; Coutinho, W; Caterson, I D",International journal of obesity,847,9

The coexistence of hypotension in these cohorts confounds the conclusion that deep hypothermia impairs cerebrovascular pressure autoregulation. AIM We sought to compare the lower limit of autoregulation and the static rate of autoregulation between normothermic and hypothermic piglets. METHODS Twenty anesthetized neonatal piglets (5-7 days old; 10 normothermic and 10 hypothermic to 20°C) had continuous measurements of cortical red cell flux using laser Doppler flowmetry, while hemorrhagic hypotension was induced without cardiopulmonary bypass. Lower limit of autoregulation was determined for each subject using piecewise regression and SRoR was determined above and below each lower limit of autoregulation as (%change cerebrovascular resistance/%change cerebral perfusion pressure). RESULTS The estimated difference in lower limit of autoregulation was 1.4 mm Hg (lower in the hypothermic piglets; 95% C.I. -10 to 14 mm Hg; P=0.6). The median lower limit of autoregulation in the normothermic group was 39 mm Hg [IQR 38-51] vs 35 mm Hg [31-50] in the hypothermic group. Intact steady-state pressure autoregulation was defined as static rate of autoregulation >0.5 and was demonstrated in all normothermic subjects (static rate of autoregulation=0.72 [0.65-0.87]) and in 9/10 of the hypothermic subjects (static rate of autoregulation=0.65 [0.52-0.87]). This difference in static rate of autoregulation of 0.06 (95% C.I. -0.3 to 0.1) was not significant (P=0.4). CONCLUSION Intact steady-state cerebrovascular pressure autoregulation is demonstrated in a swine model of profound hypothermia. Lower limit of autoregulation and static rate of autoregulation were similar in hypothermic and normothermic subjects.","Goswami, Dheeraj; McLeod, Katherine; Leonard, Samantha; Kibler, Kathleen; Easley, Ronald Blaine; Fraser, Charles D; Andropoulos, Dean; Brady, Ken",Paediatric anaesthesia,847,30

However, outcome studies for occlusion rate and patterns of the saphenous vein after RFA are scarce. The purpose of our study is to report the results of RFA in patients with varicose vein. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes after RFA using ClosureFAST (Covidien) catheter. We evaluated the occlusion rate and patterns with duplex scanning after RFA. RESULTS A total of 200 limbs (148 patients) underwent RFA. The truncal veins were ablated in 163 great saphenous veins (GSV) and 41 small saphenous veins (SSVs). The mean age was 52.1 ± 11.9 years and female to male ratio was 125 : 87. At the mean follow-up of 13.9 months, the CEAP score, VCSS, and QoL score were significantly improved 2.33 ± 0.78 to 1.29 ± 0.96 (P < 0.0001), 3.48 ± 0.98 to 0.63 ± 1.16 (P < 0.0001), and 6.91 ± 6.69 to 3.38 ± 4.74 (P < 0.0001), respectively. The occlusion rate was 94.6% (53/56) in GSV and 94.5% (17/18) in SSV. The most common occlusion pattern in GSV was total occlusion of main trunk with patent superficial inferior epigastric vein in 41.1%. And, the most common pattern in SSV was the total occlusion of SSV with stump in 66.7%. CONCLUSION RFA is an effective modality in the treatment of varicose vein. At the mean follow-up of 13.9 months, the occlusion rate was 94.6%in GSV and 94.5% in SSV. There are several patterns of saphenous occlusion after RFA.","Choi, Jung Hyun; Park, Ho-Chul; Joh, Jin Hyun",Journal of the Korean Surgical Society,847,27

Methods We reviewed 4,465 patients with influenza who visited a tertiary care hospital emergency department in Seoul (Korea) from 2010 through 2016, and underwent immunoglobulin M (IgM) serology or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for M. pneumoniae. Influenza pneumonia was defined as laboratory-confirmed influenza plus radiographic pneumonia. Patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia or non-mycoplasma bacterial coinfection were excluded. Clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings and outcomes of the influenza pneumonia patients with and without M. pneumoniae coinfection were compared. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with the coinfection. Results Of 244 influenza pneumonia patients, 41 (16.8%) had M. pneumoniae coinfection. These patients were younger with a higher frequency of age of 5-10 years, and had higher white blood cell (WBC) and lymphocyte counts; lower concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP). The coinfection had no association with specific radiographic findings and poor outcome. Multivariable analysis showed the age of 5-10 years (adjusted odds ratio, 18.83; 95% confidence interval, 5.899-60.08; P<0.001) as the factor associated with the coinfection. Conclusions M. pneumoniae coinfection in influenza pneumonia may be associated with the age of 5-10 years, and otherwise clinically indistinct from influenza pneumonia without the coinfection. This finding suggests the need for M. pneumoniae testing in patients aged 5-10 years with influenza pneumonia.","Kim, Jung Heon; Kwon, Jae Hyun; Lee, Jeong-Yong; Lee, Jong Seung; Ryu, Jeong-Min; Kim, Sung-Han; Lim, Kyoung Soo; Kim, Won Young",Journal of thoracic disease,847,1

METHODS Hungarian psychiatric workers (N = 119) including psychiatrists/psychologists (n = 78) and nurses/other professionals (n = 41) participated in the study. To measure attitudes, a questionnaire was designed consisting of 7 questions and filled out within 1-3 days after the declaration of emergency in response to COVID-19 in Hungary on March 11, 2020. RESULTS Psychiatric workers, especially psychiatrists/psychologists, regarded information gathering from valid sources as important. When examining the first feelings, we found that the psychiatrists/psychologists group tended to feel higher extent of anxiety, while the nurses/other professionals group showed higher extent of hope. When investigating willingness to work in the pandemic situation, a lower percentage of Hungarian psychiatric workers (58%) would choose to continue working compared to previous research. Answers to open-ended questions revealed that denial was the most frequent coping reaction. CONCLUSIONS These differences could be attributed to the finding that psychiatrists/psychologists, who had faced the reality of the virus situation via the news, tended to have more realistic attitudes toward the virus, while nurses/other professionals, who had avoided valid information, tended to have less realistic attitudes.","Csigó, Katalin; Ritzl, Andrea",The primary care companion for CNS disorders,847,4

Although cervical lymphadenitis is one of the major symptoms in KD, lymph node biopsy is rarely performed, because KD is usually diagnosed by clinical symptoms. A cervical lymph node biopsy was taken from a girl aged 1 year and 8 months who had suspected lymphoma, but she was diagnosed with KD after the biopsy. The cervical lymph node specimen was analyzed with multivirus real-time PCR that can detect >160 viruses, and unbiased direct sequencing with a next-generation DNA sequencer to detect potential pathogens in the lymph node. Histologically, focal necrosis with inflammatory cell infiltration, including neutrophils and macrophages, was observed in the marginal zone of the cervical lymph node, which was compatible with the acute phase of KD. Multivirus real-time PCR detected a low copy number of torque teno virus in the sample. Comprehensive direct sequencing of the cervical lymph node biopsy sample sequenced more than 8 million and 3 million reads from DNA and RNA samples, respectively. Bacterial genomes were detected in 0.03% and 1.79% of all reads in DNA and RNA samples, respectively.

SARS-CoV is not closely related to other coronaviruses but shares a similar genome organization. Entry of coronaviruses into target cells is mediated by the viral S protein. We functionally analyzed SARS-CoV S using pseudotyped lentiviral particles (pseudotypes). The SARS-CoV S protein was found to be expressed at the cell surface upon transient transfection. Coexpression of SARS-CoV S with human immunodeficiency virus-based reporter constructs yielded viruses that were infectious for a range of cell lines. Most notably, viral pseudotypes harboring SARS-CoV S infected hepatoma cell lines but not T- and B-cell lines. Infection of the hepatoma cell line Huh-7 was also observed with replication-competent SARS-CoV, indicating that hepatocytes might be targeted by SARS-CoV in vivo. Inhibition of vacuolar acidification impaired infection by SARS-CoV S-bearing pseudotypes, indicating that S-mediated entry requires low pH. Finally, infection by SARS-CoV S pseudotypes but not by vesicular stomatitis virus G pseudotypes was efficiently inhibited by a rabbit serum raised against SARS-CoV particles and by sera from SARS patients, demonstrating that SARS-CoV S is a target for neutralizing antibodies and that such antibodies are generated in SARS-CoV-infected patients. Our results show that viral pseudotyping can be employed for the analysis of SARS-CoV S function. Moreover, we provide evidence that SARS-CoV infection might not be limited to lung tissue and can be inhibited by the humoral immune response in infected patients.","Hofmann, Heike; Hattermann, Kim; Marzi, Andrea; Gramberg, Thomas; Geier, Martina; Krumbiegel, Mandy; Kuate, Seraphin; Uberla, Klaus; Niedrig, Matthias; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Journal of virology,847,24

Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of estimating subject heart rate from facial videos. However, all previous methods exhibit biased performance towards darker skin tone subjects. In this paper, we present a novel approach to mitigate biases in photoplethysmography performance on darker skin tones by relying on the statistics of imaging physics. In addition to mitigating skin tone bias, we demonstrate that the proposed method mitigates errors due to lighting changes, shadows, and specular highlights. The proposed method not only improves performance for darker skin tones but is the overall top performer on the entire dataset. We report a performance gain of 0.69 beats per minute over the benchmark for dark skin tones and an overall improvement of 0.47 bpm across all skin tones. Assessment of the proposed method is accomplished through the creation of the first telemedicine-focused smartphone camera-based remote vital signs dataset, named the VITAL dataset. A total of 344 videos (~688 minutes) consisting of 43 subjects with diverse skin tones recorded under three lighting conditions, two activity conditions, and two camera angles, is compiled with corresponding vital sign data including non-invasive continuous blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.","Chari, Pradyumna; Kabra, Krish; Karinca, Doruk; Lahiri, Soumyarup; Srivastava, Diplav; Kulkarni, Kimaya; Chen, Tianyuan; Cannesson, Maxime; Jalilian, Laleh; Kadambi, Achuta",,847,1

The need for new antibiotics is high, while the arsenal of available agents is decreasing, especially for the treatment of infections by Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are offering a promising route for novel antibiotic development and deep learning techniques can be utilised for successful AMP design. In this study, a long short-term memory (LSTM) generative model and a bidirectional LSTM classification model were constructed to design short novel AMP sequences with potential antibacterial activity against E. coli. Two versions of the generative model and six versions of the classification model were trained and optimised using Bayesian hyperparameter optimisation. These models were used to generate sets of short novel sequences that were classified as antimicrobial or non-antimicrobial. The validation accuracies of the classification models were 81.6-88.9% and the novel AMPs were classified as antimicrobial with accuracies of 70.6-91.7%. Predicted three-dimensional conformations of selected short AMPs exhibited the alpha-helical structure with amphipathic surfaces. This demonstrates that LSTMs are effective tools for generating novel AMPs against targeted bacteria and could be utilised in the search for new antibiotics leads.","Wang, Christina; Garlick, Sam; Zloh, Mire",Biomolecules,847,21

The period of confinement, which was characterized by seizing most business activities and allowing only for e-classes at schools and universities, leading also to a lower physical activity, could have affected eating behaviors of people of all ages. In this study we aimed to investigate the impact of the first lockdown period (March-May 2020) on body weight (BW) and on body mass index (BMI) in both adults and adolescents (>16 years old). A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed®, Scopus®, Web of Science® and EMBASE® databases and 36 observational (35 cross-sectional and one cohort) studies were included. BW and BMI changes after/during the lockdown period were examined. BW was stated as increased in a significant part of the individuals (11.1-72.4%), although a range of 7.2-51.4% of individuals reported weight loss. A significant higher BW was observed with a weighted mean between-group difference (WMD) 1.57 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.14) in the post-lockdown period compared to the before lockdown time and higher BMI, 0.31 WMD (95% CI, 0.17 to 0.45) was identified before the lockdown period. At variance with general trends, one study in older adults (>60 years old) notably reported a significant BW loss, suggesting a higher risk for lockdown-induced weight loss and potentially malnutrition in the elderly population. Overall increments in BW are an alarming effect of lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to potential higher incidence of overweight, obesity and related health-risks as well as other noncommunicable diseases. Further studies are needed to assess potential group-specific impacts, with particular regard to weight gain in younger people and risk of weight loss, malnutrition and sarcopenia in older adults.","Bakaloudi, Dimitra Rafailia; Barazzoni, Rocco; Bischoff, Stephan C; Breda, Joao; Wickramasinghe, Kremlin; Chourdakis, Michail",Clin. nutr.

The expression of miR-874 was significantly downregulated in human glioma tissue specimens and cell lines. Furthermore, the expression of miR-874 was associated with tumor size, KPS, and WHO grade. The decreased expression of miR-874 was associated with shorter overall survival. Then functional assays indicated that upregulation of miR-874 suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioma cells in vitro. The present study indicated that miR-874 inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioma cells and might be a novel prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for glioma.","Li, Yongjuan; Chen, Xiaoyan; Xue, Wei; Liang, Junjun; Wang, Liang",,847,0

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data for 311 patients treated with Gamma Knife radiosurgery at a single institute. The mean age at time of treatment was 60 years (range 23-86 years), and the median Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score was 90 (range 60-100). Using a new prognostic index, the prognostic index for brain metastases (PIBM), the patients were categorized into 3 groups according to the primary tumor status and KPS score. We performed survival analysis and compared the prognostic ability of the PIBM with other published indices. RESULTS: During the median follow-up duration of 8.2 months (range 0.1-109 months), the median overall survival time was 9.1 months. Stable primary tumor status (hazard ratio [HR] 0.497, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.321-0.769, p = 0.002) and KPS score &#8805;90 (HR 1.407, 95% CI 1.018-1.946, p = 0.039) significantly predicted longer overall survival. The PIBM showed the lowest Akaike information criterion value and the highest integrated area under the curve value compared with other prognostic indices. CONCLUSIONS: The PIBM may be a more accurate prognostic indicator than other published indices. Although this new and practical prognostic index requires further validation in larger cohort studies, we suggest that the PIBM could be useful to predict survival time and inform appropriate management of patients with brain metastases.","Lee, Sang Ryul; Roh, Tae Hoon; Jeong, Dong Hwan; You, Namkyu; Jang, Ae Hwa; Seo, Mi Ra; Choung, Jin Hee; Park, Bumhee; Kim, Se-Hyuk",Stereotact Funct Neurosurg,847,16

However, empiric data on transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among children and in educational settings are scarce. In Australia, most schools have remained open during the first epidemic wave, albeit with reduced student physical attendance at the epidemic peak. We examined SARS-CoV-2 transmission among children and staff in schools and early childhood education and care (ECEC) settings in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW). METHODS: Laboratory-confirmed paediatric (aged &#8804;18 years) and adult COVID-19 cases who attended a school or ECEC setting while considered infectious (defined as 24 h before symptom onset based on national guidelines during the study period) in NSW from Jan 25 to April 10, 2020, were investigated for onward transmission. All identified school and ECEC settings close contacts were required to home quarantine for 14 days, and were monitored and offered SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing if symptomatic. Enhanced investigations in selected educational settings included nucleic acid testing and SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing in symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts. Secondary attack rates were calculated and compared with state-wide COVID-19 rates. FINDINGS: 15 schools and ten ECEC settings had children (n=12) or adults (n=15) attend while infectious, with 1448 contacts monitored. Of these, 633 (43·7%) of 1448 had nucleic acid testing, or antibody testing, or both, with 18 secondary cases identified (attack rate 1·2%). Five secondary cases (three children; two adults) were identified (attack rate 0·5%; 5/914) in three schools. No secondary transmission occurred in nine of ten ECEC settings among 497 contacts. However, one outbreak in an ECEC setting involved transmission to six adults and seven children (attack rate 35·1%; 13/37). Across all settings, five (28·0%) of 18 secondary infections were asymptomatic (three infants [all aged 1 year], one adolescent [age 15 years], and one adult). INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates were low in NSW educational settings during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave, consistent with mild infrequent disease in the 1·8 million child population. With effective case-contact testing and epidemic management strategies and associated small numbers of attendances while infected, children and teachers did not contribute significantly to COVID-19 transmission via attendance in educational settings. These findings could be used to inform modelling and public health policy regarding school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Due to their regenerative and reparative properties, MSCs are extremely valuable for cell-based therapy in tackling several pathological conditions including COVID-19. Iron is essential for MSC processes but iron-loading, which is common in several chronic conditions, hinders normal MSC functionality. This not only aggravates disease pathology but can also affect allogeneic and autologous MSC therapy. Thus, understanding MSCs from an iron perspective is of clinical significance. Accordingly, this review highlights the roles of iron and iron-related proteins in MSC physiology. It describes the contribution of iron and endogenous iron-related effectors like hepcidin, ferroportin, transferrin receptor, lactoferrin, lipocalin-2, bone morphogenetic proteins and hypoxia inducible factors in MSC biology. It summarises the excess-iron-induced alterations in MSC components, processes and discusses signalling pathways involving ROS, PI3K/AKT, MAPK, p53, AMPK/MFF/DRP1 and Wnt. Additionally, it evaluates the endogenous and exogenous saviours of MSCs against iron-toxicity. Lastly, it elaborates on the involvement of MSCs in the pathology of clinical conditions of iron-excess, namely, hereditary hemochromatosis, diabetes, ß-thalassaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. This unique review integrates the distinct fields of iron regulation and MSC physiology. Through an iron-perspective, it describes both mechanistic and clinical aspects of MSCs and proposes an iron-linked MSC-contribution to physiology, pathology and therapeutics. It advances the understanding of MSC biology and may aid in identifying signalling pathways, molecular targets and compounds for formulating adjunctive iron-based therapies for excess-iron conditions, and thereby inform regenerative medicine.","Mehta, Kosha J",J. cell. physiol,847,16

The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 are very similar to other respiratory viruses. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases and associated deaths are increasing regularly in various parts of the World. Seven coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS and, COVID-19) can naturally infect human beings. Out of these four (229E-CoV, NL63-CoV, OC43-CoV, HKU1-CoV) are responsible for mild upper respiratory infections, while SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and COVID-19 are well known for their high mortality. Few mild strains of coronaviruses are circulating in India but there is no evidence of SARS and MERS outbreaks. The COVID-19 is an emerging viral infection responsible for pandemics. Fortunately, the mortality of COVID-19 is low as compared with SARS and MERS, the majority of its cases are recovered. The death toll of COVID-19 is high even after its low mortality because COVID-19 causes a pandemic while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause epidemics only. COVID-19 influenced the large segments of the world population, which led to a public health emergency of international concern, putting all health organizations on high alert.

For this purpose, an original nonlinear model relating the raw data with the time-varying geometric ratio of infected people is elaborated, and a Kalman Filter is used to estimate the involved state variables. A hypothetical simulated case is used to show the adequacy and limitations of the proposed method. Then, several countries, including China, South Korea, Italy, Spain, UK and the USA, are tested to illustrate its behavior when real-life data are processed.

It is very doubtful that comedication has a disadvantageous effect on the course of the disease. NSAIDs should be avoided in any patient with a possible severe disease, because of potential side effects. Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system should be continued when there is a solid indication, and stopped in case of hemodynamic problems. There is no preference for either ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor inhibitors. Currently, chloroquine and remdesivir are possible treatment options. There is no sound evidence for either treatment. Chloroquine has side effects (nausea, QT prolongation) and there are several drug interactions. The treatment should be reconsidered in the event of side effects and when inferior medication for comorbidity must be prescribed because of possible interactions. Lopinavir/ritonavir is not effective.

Furthermore, abrupt short-term fluctuations in seawater pCO2 characteristic of near-shore coastal regions and high-density aquaculture sites currently have the potential to influence organismal and community functioning by altering animal behaviour. While anti-predator responses in fishes exposed to elevated pCO2 are well documented, such responses in benthic marine invertebrates are poorly studied. We used high frequency, non-invasive biosensors to test whether or not short term (3-week) exposure to elevated pCO2 could impact behavioural responses to the threat of predation in adult Mediterranean mussels from Galicia on the northwestern coast of Spain. Predator alarm cues (crushed conspecifics) resulted in a prolonged (1 h) reduction in the degree of valve opening (-20%) but had no clear effect on overall valve movement activity, while elevated pCO2 did not affect either response. Our results add to the increasing body of evidence suggesting that the effects of end-of-century pCO2 levels on marine animal behaviour are likely weak. Nonetheless, longer-term exposures spanning multiple generations are needed to better understand how ocean acidification might impact behavioural responses to predation in marine bivalves.","Clements, Jeff C; Poirier, Luke A; Pérez, Fiz F; Comeau, Luc A; Babarro, José M F",Mar Environ Res,847,17

We characterised individuals with COVID-19 among a cohort of HIV-infected adults in Madrid. METHODS: In this observational prospective study, we included all consecutive HIV-infected individuals (aged &#8805;18 years) who had suspected or confirmed COVID-19 as of April 30, 2020, at the Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal (Madrid, Spain). We compared the characteristics of HIV-infected individuals with COVID-19 with a sample of HIV-infected individuals assessed before the COVID-19 pandemic, and described the outcomes of individuals with COVID-19. FINDINGS: 51 HIV-infected individuals were diagnosed with COVID-19 (incidence 1·8%, 95% CI 1·3-2·3). Mean age of patients was 53·3 years (SD 9·5); eight (16%) were women, and 43 (84%) men. 35 (69%) cases of co-infection had laboratory confirmed COVID-19, and 28 (55%) required hospital admission. Age and CD4 cell counts in 51 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were similar to those in 1288 HIV-infected individuals without; however, 32 (63%) with COVID-19 had at least one comorbidity (mostly hypertension and diabetes) compared with 495 (38%) without COVID-19 (p=0·00059). 37 (73%) patients had received tenofovir before COVID-19 diagnosis compared with 487 (38%) of those without COVID-19 (p=0·0036); 11 (22%) in the COVID-19 group had previous protease inhibitor use (mostly darunavir) compared with 175 (14%; p=0·578). Clinical, analytical, and radiological presentation of COVID-19 in HIV-infected individuals was similar to that described in the general population. Six (12%) individuals were critically ill, two of whom had CD4 counts of less than 200 cells per µL, and two (4%) died. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR remained positive after a median of 40 days from symptoms onset in six (32%) individuals, four of whom had severe disease or low nadir CD4 cell counts. INTERPRETATION: HIV-infected individuals should not be considered to be protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection or to have lower risk of severe disease. Generally, they should receive the same treatment approach applied to the general population.

We used a mixed-methods, digital ethnographic approach to evaluate social media discussions about patient concerns and preferences for urolithiasis care during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed kidney stone-related discussions on a large social media platform using qualitative analysis and natural language processing-based sentiment analysis. Posts were mined for demographic details, treatments pursued, and health care encounters. Pre-COVID (1/1/2020-2/29/2020) and COVID (3/1/2020-6/1/2020) posts were extracted from the popular online Reddit discussion board, ""r/KidneyStones,"" which is dedicated to discussions related to urolithiasis. RESULTS: We extracted n=649 posts (250 pre-COVID, 399 COVID); 150 from each cohort underwent thematic analysis and data extraction. Quantitative sentiment analysis was performed on 418 posts (179 pre-COVID, 239 COVID) that described stone-related decision-making prior to intervention. Notable discussion themes during COVID focused on barriers to care and concerns about stone management. Discussants exhibited more negative and anxious tones during COVID, based on sentiment analysis (P<0.01). Patient preferences shifted away from in-person visits and procedures (P<0.001). Mean reported stone size among those visiting ER increased from 5.1 mm to 10.5 mm (P<0.001). The proportion of discussants preferring conservative management with stones &#8805;10 mm increased (12.5% pre-COVID versus 26% during COVID, P=0.002). Opioid mentions increased from 9% to 27% of posts (P<0.001) and were most associated with conservative management discussions. CONCLUSIONS: Online discussion forums provide contemporaneous insight into patients' experiences during a time when traditional patient-centered research methodologies are limited due to social distancing. During the pandemic, patients with symptomatic kidney stones expressed anxiety regarding outpatient encounters and reluctance toward procedural intervention. Patients opted instead for at-home conservative treatment beyond clinical guidelines and reserved ER visits for larger stones, potentially causing self-harm. Opioid discussions proliferated, an alarming consequence of the pandemic.","Jiang, Tommy; Osadchiy, Vadim; Weinberger, James M; Zheng, Michael H; Owen, Michael H; Leonard, Sarah A; Mills, Jesse N; Kachroo, Naveen; Eleswarapu, Sriram V",J. endourol,847,20

This stems from the heterogeneous response of individuals to disease and is reflected in the inter-individual variability of gene expression responses that obscures differential gene expression analysis. Here, we developed an alternative approach that could be applied to dissect the disease-associated molecular changes. We define gene ensemble noise as a measure that represents a variance for a collection of genes encoding for either members of known biological pathways or subunits of annotated protein complexes and calculated within an individual. The gene ensemble noise allows for the holistic identification and interpretation of gene expression disbalance on the level of gene networks and systems. By comparing gene expression data from COVID-19, H1N1, and sepsis patients we identified common disturbances in a number of pathways and protein complexes relevant to the sepsis pathology. Among others, these include the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and peroxisomes. This suggests a Warburg effect and oxidative stress as common hallmarks of the immune host-pathogen response. Finally, we showed that gene ensemble noise could successfully be applied for the prediction of clinical outcome namely, the mortality of patients. Thus, we conclude that gene ensemble noise represents a promising approach for the investigation of molecular mechanisms of pathology through a prism of alterations in the coherent expression of gene circuits.","de Jong, Tristan V; Guryev, Victor; Moshkin, Yuri M",Sci Rep,847,16

OBJECTIVE: To understand residents and fellows' attitudes toward vaccination and record any side effects after vaccination. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous survey that was open from 3-1-2021 to 3-12-2021 using distribution lists from the Graduate Medical Education office on the Lubbock campus of the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center after getting approval from the Institutional Review Board (L21-088). RESULTS: Eighty-one residents and fellows (26.6% out of 304) responded to our survey. Among those who responded, 63 (77.8 %) were between 25 and 35 years old, and 41 (50.6%) were males. Seventy-seven (95.1%) received the vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech), 78 (96.3%) reported that they supported vaccination, and 3 (3.7%) reported that they did not want vaccination. Eight members (9.8%) had tested positive for COVID-19 infection before vaccination, but only 1 (1.23%) had tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies.

In this regard, patients with autoimmune diseases or those receiving immunosuppressive agents and anti-cancer therapies, need special attention. However, no confirmed data is presently available regarding COVID-19 vaccines in these populations due to exclusion from the conducted clinical trials. Given the probable suppression or over-activation of the immune system in such patients, reaching a consensus for their vaccination is critical, besides gathering data and conducting trials, which could probably clarify this matter in the future. In this review, besides a brief on the available COVID-19 vaccines, considerations and available knowledge about administering similar vaccines in patients with cancer, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, solid organ transplantation, multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and rheumatologic and dermatologic autoimmune disorders are summarized to help in decision making. As discussed, live-attenuated viruses, which should be avoided in these groups, are not employed in the present COVID-19 vaccines. Thus, the main concern regarding efficacy could be met using a potent COVID-19 vaccine. Moreover, the vaccination timing for maximum efficacy could be decided according to the patient's condition, indicated medications, and the guides provided here.

Hydrogel materials that can embed living cells for use in 3D printing are called bioinks.

A polyurethane-gelatin double network hydrogel bioink was previously reported to own tunable modulus through changing the solid content, but cell viability at the high solid content is inevitably reduced. In the present study, the reinforcement effects of a metal-organic framework (MOF), zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), in the PUG bioink were evaluated. The printability, stackability, thermoresponsiveness, and shear-thinning behavior of the PUG-ZIF-8 composite hydrogels were examined. It was found that the PUG composite hydrogel containing 1250 µg/mL ZIF-8 crystals showed significant structural stability and modulus enhancement (â¼2.5-fold). However, the PUG bioink containing 1250 µg/mL ZIF-8 crystals may lead to cell senescence or death. The cytocompatible concentration of ZIF-8 crystals in the bioink was about 875 µg/mL, and this concentration was much higher than the reported tolerable amount (â¼50 µg/mL) of ZIF-8 for biomedical applications. The strong reinforcement effect of ZIF-8 and the drug-loading/sensing possibilities of MOFs may open new opportunities for using MOFs in 3D bioprinting applications.","Hsieh, Cheng-Tien; Ariga, Katsuhiko; Shrestha, Lok Kumar; Hsu, Shan-Hui",Biomacromolecules,847,24

Although there is increased understanding of clinical factors associated with severe disease, studies investigating biomarkers to predict severity and uncover treatment targets are still needed. Polyunsaturated fatty acid-derived lipid mediators (PUFA-LM) can promote inflammation or resolution of inflammation. Previous research showed differences in PUFA-LM expression in septic patients that developed ARDS. Here we evaluate the plasma PUFA-LM profile at admission in 20 patients with COVID-19 and correlate our findings with disease severity. Methods: Blood was collected at admission from 41 patients with COVID-19 at Virginia Commonwealth University between April and July, 2020. Platelet poor plasma from 20 patients were selected;10 with nonsevere COVID19 (NSC) defined by &lt;4L O2 need and 10 severe COVID-19 subjects (SC) defined as requiring admission to the intensive care unit, for PUFA-LM analysis by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Patients with active malignancy were excluded. Results: Demographic data and comorbidities are similar between the two groups. Both cohorts were predominately African American (80%) and male (60%). The SC cohort exhibited higher levels of lipoxygenase metabolites, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs), hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids (HEPEs) and hydroxydocosahexaenoic acids (HDoHEs), which serve as intermediates in the synthesis of both pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators. Epoxygenase metabolites were also higher in the SC cohort and were mostly diols indicating elevated epoxide hydrolase activity. Conversely PGE1 and 15-OxoETE were elevated in the NSC cohort compared to SC. Discussion: In this predominantly African-American patient cohort, admission PUFA-LM profiles differed in subjects who developed mild vs. severe COVID19. Higher levels of lipoxygenase activity in the SC cohort is of unclear significance since this pathway promotes synthesis of both pro-inflammatory and pro-resolving mediators. Given sample collection early in the disease course it may signify incomplete synthesis of resolution mediators or increased inflammation. The higher levels of diols from epoxides are intriguing. PUFA epoxides are anti-inflammatory and prevent prostaglandins from eliciting an inflammatory response. Hence, higher levels of epoxide hydrolysis in SC cohort suggests an exacerbation of inflammation by prostaglandins. Higher levels of PGE1 (a known pulmonary vasodilator) and 15-OxoETE (an anti-inflammatory mediator which inhibits NFκB activation) in the NSC group may contribute to a dampening of inflammatory response in NSC cohort. Overall, this data suggests a complex interplay of dysfunctional homeostatic and inflammatory mechanisms early in disease which may contribute to development of severe COVID-19.","Jackson, P.; Freeberg, M.

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 28 confirmed COVID-19 cases with 145 CT scans are collected. The lesions are detected automatically and the parameters including lesion volume (LeV/mL), lesion percentage to lung volume (LeV%), mean lesion density (MLeD/HU), low attenuation area lower than - 400HU (LAA-400%), and lesion weight (LM/mL*HU) are computed for quantification. The dynamic changes of lungs are traced from the day of initial symptoms to the day of discharge. The lesion distribution among the five lobes and the dynamic changes in each lobe are also analyzed. RESULTS: LeV%, MLeD, and LM reach peaks on days 9, 6 and 8, followed by a decrease trend in the next two weeks. LAA-400% (mostly the ground glass opacity) declines to the lowest on days 4-5, and then increases. The lesion is mostly seen in the bilateral lower lobes, followed by the left upper lobe, right upper lobe and right middle lobe (pâ<â0.05). The right middle lobe is the earliest one (on days 6-7), while the right lower lobe is the latest one (on days 9-10) that reaches to peak among the five lobes. CONCLUSIONS: Severity of COVID-19 increases from the day of initial symptoms, reaches to the peak around on day 8, and then decreases. Lesion is more commonly seen in the bilateral lower lobes.","Shen, Cong; Yu, Nan; Cai, Shubo; Zhou, Jie; Sheng, Jiexin; Liu, Kang; Zhou, Heping; Guo, Youmin",J Xray Sci Technol,847,16

Studies have shown promising results for detection of COVID-19 from viral bacterial pneumonia in chest X-rays. Automation of COVID-19 testing using medical images can speed up the testing process of patients where health care systems lack sufficient numbers of the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests. Supervised deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks need enough labeled data for all classes to correctly learn the task of detection. Gathering labeled data is a cumbersome task and requires time and resources which could further strain health care systems and radiologists at the early stages of a pandemic such as COVID-19. In this study, we propose a randomized generative adversarial network (RANDGAN) that detects images of an unknown class (COVID-19) from known and labelled classes (Normal and Viral Pneumonia) without the need for labels and training data from the unknown class of images (COVID-19). We used the largest publicly available COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, COVIDx, which is comprised of Normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19 images from multiple public databases. In this work, we use transfer learning to segment the lungs in the COVIDx dataset. Next, we show why segmentation of the region of interest (lungs) is vital to correctly learn the task of classification, specifically in datasets that contain images from different resources as it is the case for the COVIDx dataset. Finally, we show improved results in detection of COVID-19 cases using our generative model (RANDGAN) compared to conventional generative adversarial networks for anomaly detection in medical images, improving the area under the ROC curve from 0.71 to 0.77.","Motamed, Saman; Rogalla, Patrik; Khalvati, Farzad",Sci Rep,847,20

We aimed to evaluate the impact of the intervention on hospital visits in Yinzhou District, Ningbo, Zhejiang province, China. METHODS: We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis from 1 January 2017 to 6 September 2020 based on the Yinzhou Health Information System in Ningbo, Zhejiang province. The beginning of the intervention was on 23 January 2020, and thus, there were 160 weeks before the intervention and 32 weeks after the implementation of the intervention. Level changes between expected and observed hospital visits in the post-intervention period were estimated using quasi-Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Compared with the expected level, there was an estimated decrease of -22.60% (95% confidence interval (CI): -27.53%, -17.36%) in the observed total hospital visits following the intervention. Observed hospital visits for diseases of the respiratory system were found to be decreased dramatically (-62.25%; 95% CI: -65.62%, -58.60%). However, observed hospital visits for certain diseases were estimated to be increased, including diseases of the nervous system (+11.17%; 95% CI: +3.21%, +19.74%); diseases of pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (+27.01%; 95% CI: +17.89%, +36.85%); certain conditions originating in the perinatal period (+45.05%; 95% CI: +30.24%, +61.56%); and congenital malformation deformations and chromosomal abnormalities (+35.50%; 95% CI: +21.24%, +51.45%).

The diameter in the current paradigm of shallow tracing is unlikely to reach the silent clusters that might be as important as the symptomatic cases in the spread of the disease. Group testing is a feasible and promising approach when the resources are scarce and when a relatively low prevalence regime is observed on the population. METHODS: We employed group testing with a sparse random pooling scheme and conventional group test decoding algorithms both for exact and inexact recovery. RESULTS: Our simulations showed that significant reduction in per case test numbers (or expansion in total test numbers preserving the number of actual tests conducted) for very sparse prevalence regimes is available. Currently proposed COVID-19 group testing schemes offer a gain up to 15X-20X scale-up. There is a good probability that the required scale up to achieve massive scale testing might be greater in certain scenarios. We investigated if further improvement is available, especially in sparse prevalence occurrence where outbreaks are needed to be avoided by population scans. CONCLUSION: Our simulations show that sparse random pooling can provide improved efficiency gains compared to conventional group testing or Reed-Solomon error correcting codes. Therefore, we propose that special designs for different scenarios could be available and it is possible to scale up testing capabilities significantly.","Nalbantoglu, Ozkan Ufuk",BMC Med Res Methodol,847,3

Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) bear 80 % of the mental health disease burden. Stigma associated with mental health results in delayed help seeking, reduced access to health services, suboptimal treatment, poor outcomes and an increased risk of individuals' human rights violations. Moreover, widespread co-occurrence of physical comorbidities such as noncommunicable diseases with mental health disorders makes the treatment of both conditions challenging and worsens prognosis. This paper explores various aspects of stigma towards mental health with a focus on LMICs and assesses measures to increase help-seeking and access to and uptake of mental health services. Stigma impacts persons living with mental illness, their families and caregivers and healthcare professionals (mental health professionals, non-psychiatric specialists and general practitioners) imparting mental health care. Cultural, socio-economic and religious factors determine various aspects of mental health in LMICs, ranging from perceptions of health and illness, health seeking behavior, attitudes of the individuals and health practitioners and mental health systems. Addressing stigma requires comprehensive and inclusive mental health policies and legislations; sustainable and culturally-adapted awareness programs; capacity building of mental health workforce through task-shifting and interprofessional approaches; and improved access to mental health services by integration with primary healthcare and utilizing existing pathways of care. Future strategies targeting stigma reduction must consider the enormous physical comorbidity burden associated with mental health, prioritize workplace interventions and importantly, address the deterioration of population mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Javed, Afzal; Lee, Cheng; Zakaria, Hazli; Buenaventura, Robert D; Cetkovich-Bakmas, Marcelo; Duailibi, Kalil; Ng, Bernardo; Ramy, Hisham; Saha, Gautam; Arifeen, Shams; Elorza, Paola M; Ratnasingham, Priyan; Azeem, Muhammad Waqar",Asian J Psychiatr,847,33

However, clinical trials targeting IL-17A in uveitis were not successful. Here, we report that Th17 cells were regulated by their own signature cytokine, IL-17A. Loss of IL-17A in autopathogenic Th17 cells did not reduce their pathogenicity and instead elevated their expression of the Th17 cytokines GM-CSF and IL-17F. Mechanistic in vitro studies revealed a Th17 cell-intrinsic autocrine loop triggered by binding of IL-17A to its receptor, leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-&#954;B and induction of IL-24, which repressed the Th17 cytokine program. In vivo, IL-24 treatment ameliorated Th17-induced EAU, whereas silencing of IL-24 in Th17 cells enhanced disease. This regulatory pathway also operated in human Th17 cells. Thus, IL-17A limits pathogenicity of Th17 cells by inducing IL-24.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir-ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first. RESULTS: A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir-ritonavir group, and 100 to the standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with a difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95 to 1.80). Mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir-ritonavir group and the standard-care group (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, -5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir-ritonavir led to a median time to clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the lopinavir-ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir-ritonavir treatment was stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir-ritonavir treatment beyond standard care.

DESIGN: Retrospective, single-centre cohort study. SETTING: Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. PARTICIPANTS: Among a cohort of 308 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19, 138 patients died while 170 patients recovered and were discharged from the hospital. The data were collected until 27 February 2020. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were obtained from electronic medical records using data collection forms. RESULTS: The percentage of patients with elevated interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) increased with severity of disease (p<0.0001 for all). IL-2R (p<0.0001), IL-6 (p<0.0001), IL-8 (p=0.0001), IL-10 (p<0.0001) and TNF (p<0.0001) were also twofold to 20-fold higher in patients who died compared with those who recovered. Also, IL-6 and IL-10 increased in both the progressive patient groups: moderate (p=0.0026) and severe (p<0.0001).

Although reducing viral transmission is critical, physical distancing is associated with negative psychosocial implications, such as increased rates of depression and anxiety. Promising evidence suggests that participatory digital co-design, defined as the combination of user-centered design and community engagement models, is associated with increased levels of engagement with mobile technologies among individuals with mental health conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted shortcomings of existing technologies and challenges in their uptake and usage; however, strategies such as co-design may be leveraged to address these challenges both in the adaptation of existing technologies and the development of new technologies. By incorporating these strategies, it is hoped that we can offset some of the negative mental health implications for older adults in the context of physical distancing both during and beyond the current pandemic.","Cosco, Theodore D; Fortuna, Karen; Wister, Andrew; Riadi, Indira; Wagner, Kevin; Sixsmith, Andrew",J Med Internet Res,847,24

Using auto-regression technique and using week 5 death count as input the linear regression model predicted week 6 death count in India to be 467, while keeping at the back of our mind the risk of over-estimation by most of the risk-based models. CONCLUSION: According to our analysis, if situation continue in present state; projected death rate (n) is 211 and467 at the end of the 5th and 6th week from now, respectively.","Ghosal, Samit; Sengupta, Sumit; Majumder, Milan; Sinha, Binayak",Diabetes Metab Syndr,847,1

Rapid increase in the COVID-19 cases across the world requires fast and efficient testing as testing capacity is a bottleneck in diagnosis. In this context, pooling strategy can be opted for rapid testing in a cost-effective manner. In this study, the authors have optimized and compared the effect of pooling (5 and 10 samples) before and after nucleic acid extraction. It was concluded that there was no significant difference in the SARS CoV-2 RNA detection in the pools prepared at sample or RNA level. Even after pooling, 10-fold dilution was detectable with 3-cycle threshold value change in both type of pools when compared with individual samples. Hence, sample pool size of 10 can be used in low-prevalent areas, and testing capacity can be substantially increased.","Chhikara, Komal; Kanta, Poonam; Ghosh, Arnab; Prakash, Rishi Chetanya; Goyal, Kapil; Singh, Mini P",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,847,33

However, COVID-19 has exposed the importance of providing continued care for patients while minimizing the risk of exposure during pandemics. There has been robust growth in the use of telemedicine since the pandemic began, rendering safety in care provided by minimizing exposure to patients and healthcare workers. There has been tremendous growth and innovation in various digital applications that facilitate telehealth as the platforms continue to improve. Even in the absence of a pandemic, telemedicine allows for care of patients who may live in remote areas or have issues with transportation and comorbidities prohibiting ambulation. This study is based on a questionnaire for healthcare providers who have been exposed to telemedicine during COVID-19. A survey was shared in social media forums involving groups of physicians and nurse practitioners who were willing to take the survey. Telemedicine is one of the best approaches to handling situations like pandemics or disease surges. In these circumstances, a virtual visit is beneficial for social distancing if a laptop, smartphone, or tablet is available, along with internet or cellular coverage. This survey was conducted among healthcare workers of various specialties and it was found out that there was a considerable impetus for the continued benefit from telemedicine as an alternative to in-person visits for selected patients. Ongoing improvements in the quality of applications/tools, education, and cost are essential to maintain telemedicine. There is also a constant necessity for vast improvements in healthcare policies and reimbursements to allow for telemedicine to evolve.","Siraj, A.; Salehi, N.; Karim, S.",Cureus,847,20

We extracted influenza cases reported between 2016 and 2019 and COVID-19 cases reported in March and April 2020 from a hospital network in Rhode Island. We performed a spatiotemporal hotspot analysis to simulate a real-time surveillance scenario.Results. We analyzed 6527 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases and identified microepidemics in more than 1100 neighborhoods, and more than half of the neighborhoods that had hotspots in a season became hotspots in the next season. We used data from 731 COVID-19 cases, and we found that a neighborhood was 1.90 times more likely to become a COVID-19 hotspot if it had been an influenza hotspot in 2018 to 2019.Conclusions. The use of readily available hospital data allows the real-time identification of spatiotemporal trends and hotspots of microepidemics.Public Health Implications. As local governments move to reopen the economy and ease physical distancing, the use of historic influenza hotspots could guide early prevention interventions, while the real-time identification of hotspots would enable the implementation of interventions that focus on small-area containment and mitigation.","Mylona, Evangelia K; Shehadeh, Fadi; Kalligeros, Markos; Benitez, Gregorio; Chan, Philip A; Mylonakis, Eleftherios",Am J Public Health,847,16

Early initiation of therapeutic heparin could decrease the thrombo-inflammatory process, and reduce the risk of critical illness or death. MethodsWe randomly assigned moderately ill hospitalized ward patients admitted for Covid-19 with elevated D-dimer level to therapeutic or prophylactic heparin. The primary outcome was a composite of death, invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation or ICU admission. Safety outcomes included major bleeding.

METHODS: The Pediatric Emergency Research Network has grown from 5- to 8-member networks over the past decade. With an executive committee comprising representatives from all member networks, PERN plays a supportive and collaborative rather than governing role. The full impact of PERN's facilitation of international collaborative research, although somewhat difficult to quantify empirically, can be measured indirectly by the observed growth of the field, the nature of the increasingly challenging research questions now being addressed, and the collective capacity to generate and implement new knowledge in treating acutely ill and injured children. RESULTS: Beginning as a pandemic response with a high-quality retrospective case-controlled study of H1N1 influenza risk factors, PERN research has progressed to multiple observational studies and ongoing global randomized controlled trials. As a recent example, PERN has developed sufficient network infrastructure to enable the rapid initiation of a prospective observational study in response to the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. In light of the ongoing need for translation of research knowledge into equitable clinical practice and to promote health equity, PERN is committed to a coordinated international effort to increase the uptake of evidence-based management of common and treatable acute conditions in all emergency department settings. CONCLUSIONS: The Pediatric Emergency Research Network's successes with global research, measured by prospective observational and interventional studies, mean that the network can now move to improve its ability to promote the implementation of scientific advances into everyday clinical practice. Achieving this goal will involve focus in 4 areas: (1) expanding the capacity for global randomized controlled trials; (2) deepening the focus on implementation science; (3) increasing attention to healthcare disparities and their origins, with growing momentum toward equity; and (4) expanding PERN's global reach through addition of sites and networks from resource-restricted regions. Through these actions, PERN will be able to build on successes to face the challenges ahead and meet the needs of acutely ill and injured children throughout the world.","Klassen, Terry; Dalziel, Stuart R; Babl, Franz E; Benito, Javier; Bressan, Silvia; Chamberlain, James; Chang, Todd P; Freedman, Stephen B; Kohn-Loncarica, Guillermo; Lyttle, Mark D; Mintegi, Santiago; Mistry, Rakesh D; Nigrovic, Lise E; Oostenbrink, Rianne; Plint, Amy C; Rino, Pedro; Roland, Damian; Van De Mosselaer, Gregory; Kuppermann, Nathan",Pediatr Emerg Care,847,16

One of the major challenges in controlling the COVID-19 outbreak is its asymptomatic infection and transmission, which are elusive and defenseless in most situations. The pathogenicity and virulence of asymptomatic COVID-19 remain mysterious. Based on the genotyping of 20656 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome isolates, we reveal that asymptomatic infection is linked to SARS-CoV-2 11083G>T mutation, i.e., leucine (L) to phenylalanine (F) substitution at the residue 37 (L37F) of nonstructure protein 6 (NSP6). By analyzing the distribution of 11083G>T in various countries, we unveil that 11083G>T may correlate with the hypotoxicity of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, we show a global decaying tendency of the 11083G>T mutation ratio indicating that 11083G>T hinders SARS-CoV-2 transmission capacity. Sequence alignment found both NSP6 and residue 37 neighborhoods are relatively conservative over a few coronaviral species, indicating their importance in regulating host cell autophagy to undermine innate cellular defense against viral infection. Using machine learning and topological data analysis, we demonstrate that mutation L37F has made NSP6 energetically less stable. The rigidity and flexibility index and several network models suggest that mutation L37F may have compromised the NSP6 function, leading to a relatively weak SARS-CoV subtype. This assessment is a good agreement with our genotyping of SARS-CoV-2 evolution and transmission across various countries and regions over the past few months.","Wang, Rui; Hozumi, Yuta; Yin, Changchuan; Wei, Guo-Wei",,847,24

The aim of this study was to investigate the chest CT features associated with critical and non-critical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods A total of 1078 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent chest CT scans, including 169 critical cases and 909 non-critical cases, were enrolled in this retrospective study. The scans of all participants were reviewed and compared in two groups of study. In addition, the risk factors associated with disease in critical and non-critical patients were analyzed. Results Chest CT scans showed bilateral and multifocal involvement in most (86.4%) of the participants, with 97.6 and 84.3% reported in critical and non-critical patients, respectively. The incidences of pure consolidation (p = 0.019), mixed ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation (p < 0.001), pleural effusion (p < 0.001), and intralesional traction bronchiectasis (p = 0.007) were significantly higher in critical compared to non-critical patients. However, non-critical patients showed higher incidence of pure GGOs than the critical patients (p < 0.001). Finally, the total opacity scores of the critical patients were significantly higher than those of non-critical patients (13.71 ± 6.26 versus 4.86 ± 3.52, p < 0.001), with an area under the curve of 0.91 (0.88-0.94) for COVID-19 detection. Conclusions Our results revealed that the chest CT examination was an effective means of detecting pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities in the natural course of COVID-19.

An increasing number of publications report neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19. However, no studies have comprehensively reviewed the clinical and paraclinical characteristics of the central and peripheral nervous system's involvement in these patients. This study aimed to describe the features of the central and peripheral nervous system involvement by COVID-19 in terms of pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, neuropathology, neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and cerebrospinal fluid findings. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive systematic review of all the original studies reporting patients with neurological involvement by COVID-19, from December 2019 to June 2020, without language restriction. We excluded studies with animal subjects, studies not related to the nervous system, and opinion articles. Data analysis combined descriptive measures, frequency measures, central tendency measures, and dispersion measures for all studies reporting neurological conditions and abnormal ancillary tests in patients with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 143 observational and descriptive studies reported central and peripheral nervous system involvement by COVID-19 in 10,723 patients. Fifty-one studies described pathophysiologic mechanisms of neurological involvement by COVID-19, 119 focused on clinical manifestations, 4 described neuropathology findings, 62 described neuroimaging findings, 28 electrophysiology findings, and 60 studies reported cerebrospinal fluid results. The reviewed studies reflect a significant prevalence of the nervous system's involvement in patients with COVID-19, ranging from 22.5 to 36.4% among different studies, without mortality rates explicitly associated with neurological involvement by SARS-CoV-2. We thoroughly describe the clinical and paraclinical characteristics of neurological involvement in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our evidence synthesis led to a categorical analysis of the central and peripheral neurological involvement by COVID-19 and provided a comprehensive explanation of the reported pathophysiological mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause neurological impairment.

METHODS: We use recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to compute age-specific death rates (ASDRs) for three causes of death: deaths from COVID-19, residual deaths, and total deaths for four age-groups (55-64, 65-74, 75-84, and 85 and older) to assess the impact of COVID-19 on older Latino mortality relative to non-Latino Whites and non-Latino Blacks and also in comparison to residual deaths. Additionally, we obtain ASDRs for all causes of deaths from 1999 to 2018 to provide a pre-pandemic context and assess the extent to which the consistently observed mortality advantage of Latinos persists during the pandemic. RESULTS: Consistent with previous research, our findings show that Latinos have lower ASDRs for non-COVID-19 causes of death across all age groups compared to non-Latino Whites. However, our findings indicate that Latinos have significantly higher ASDRs for COVID-19 deaths than non-Latino Whites. Furthermore, although the Latino advantage for total deaths persists during the pandemic, it has diminished significantly compared to the 1999-2018 period. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that as a result of the pandemic, the time-tested Latino paradox has rapidly diminished due to higher COVID-19 mortality among older Latino adults compared to non-Latino Whites. Future research should continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 to assess the disparate impact of the pandemic on older Black, Latino and non-Latino White adults as additional data become available.","Sáenz, Rogelio; Garcia, Marc A",,847,22

The basis of this interest comes from the established effect vitamin D status has on other acute respiratory infections, such as influenza. This article aims to determine the role and effect of vitamin D serum concentration in the prevalence and severity of COVID-19. RECENT FINDINGS: Several observational studies have demonstrated that suboptimal levels of vitamin D serum concentrations can significantly increase the risk of developing COVID-19 and lead to a more severe symptomatology. One study suggests, however, that supplementation of vitamin D could potentially increase the incidence of mortality in COVID-19 patients. SUMMARY: Vitamin D status could have an influential role in the development and progression of SARS-CoV2 infection. Further studies are warranted to understand fully the veracity and the extent of this association.","Paiz, Nicole; Alonso, Paula; Portillo, Ana Luisa",Curr Trop Med Rep,847,28

DESIGN: An umbrella review of systematic reviews was undertaken using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methods. DATA SOURCES: The Cochrane database of systematic reviews, JBI Evidence Synthesis, MEDLINE, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Embase and CINAHL were searched in March 2021 for reviews published in English. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Systematic reviews reporting the prevalence of anxiety and depression among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two researchers screened each abstract and independently reviewed full text articles. Study quality was assessed using the JBI critical appraisal tool for systematic reviews, and the degree of overlap in primary studies was calculated. RESULTS: Ten systematic reviews (100 unique studies), including 169 157 HCWs from 35 countries were included. The prevalence of anxiety among all HCWs ranged from 22.2% (95% CI 21.3% to 23.1%) to 33.0% (95% CI 31.9% to 34.1%). The prevalence of anxiety among physicians (n=5820) was reported to be between 17% and 19.8% and for nurses (n=14 938) between 22.8% and 27%. The prevalence of depression among all HCWs ranged from 17.9% (95% CI 17.1% to 18.8%) to 36% (95% CI 34.9% to 37.1%). The prevalence of depression among physicians (n=643) and nurses (n=8063) was reported to be 40.4% and 28%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There is wide variation evident in the presence of anxiety and depression among HCWs. In particular, the prevalence of depression among physicians was high. Strategies to reduce the incidence of anxiety and depression are urgently required.

Describe patterns in the dissemination of fake news in the context of COVID-19 mortality and infodemic management in six Latin American countries. METHODS. A descriptive ecological study explored the percentage of the population that is unable to recognize fake news, the percentage who trust social network content, and the percentage who use it as their sole news source in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, up to 29 November 2020. Internet penetration rate, Facebook penetration rate, and COVID-19 mortality were calculated for each country. Information was obtained from literature searches and government and news portals in the selected countries, according to the World Health Organization’s five proposed action areas: identifying evidence, translating knowledge and science, amplifying action, quantifying impact, and coordination and governance. RESULTS. Chile and Argentina were the countries with the greatest internet penetration rates (92.4% and 92.0%, respectively) and were also among the heaviest users of social media as their only means of obtaining news (32.0% and 28.0%, respectively). Brazil and Colombia showed intermediate behavior for both indicators. Mexico had the highest use of social networks, while Peru and Colombia had the highest indices of inability to recognize fake news. CONCLUSIONS. It was observed that in countries with less use of social networks as the sole means for obtaining information and less trust in social network content, mortality was also lower.","Nieves-Cuervo, Giselly Mayerly; Manrique-Hernández, Edgar F.; Robledo-Colonia, Angelo Fernando; Grillo, Ardila Elvia Karina",Rev Panam Salud Publica,847,8

Approximately 3.1 million or 21 percent of new cases in periods of on-demand testing are likely due to that policy through early November 2020. During periods in a given country when only persons with symptoms were tested, or persons with symptoms and key vulnerable populations were tested, negative tests were associated with fewer new cases 14 days out.

The purpose of this study was to identify dietary habits and their associations with food insecurity and attitudes among adults living in the United States within three months post-mandated quarantine. An online cross-sectional study was conducted from April to June 2020. Participants (n = 3133) responded to a 71-item questionnaire regarding demographics (n = 7), health information (n = 5), lifestyle habits (n = 8), dietary habits (n = 37), food attitudes (n = 8), and food security status (n = 6). Frequency counts and percentages were tabulated, and multivariate linear regression was conducted to examine associations using STATA v14 at a statistical significance level of p < 0.05. Results showed that most participants indicated no change in dietary habits (43.6–87.4%), yet participants reported increased consumption of sweets (43.8%) and salty snacks (37.4%).

BACKGROUND. Betacoronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread in early 2020 worldwide just in several months. The official statistics are consistently collected, but this is mainly based on symptomatic reports. This study was aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Lithuanian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Study was conducted during August–September 2020 in 6 municipalities of Lithuania. The sample comprised 3087 adult participants from the general population (mean age 53.7 years, 64% female). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were assessed using AMP IgM/IgG Rapid Test, other data were based on self-report. Seroprevalence was assessed as a crude estimate and as adjusted by sensitivity-specificity of the test. RESULTS. The crude seroprevalence in the total sample was 1.9%, the adjusted – 1.4%, ranging from 0.8% to 2.4% across municipalities. Among seroprevalent cases, 67.2% had IgG, 29.3% had IgM, and 3.5% had both IgG and IgM. An increased risk for seropositive test was observed among people who reported having had close contacts with SARS-CoV-2 positives (OR=5.49, p<0.001). At the borderline significance were female gender (OR=1.75, p=0.082) and non-smoking status (OR=2.95, p=0.072). Among the seropositive participants, 69.0% reported having had no COVID-19 symptoms since 1 March 2020, while 31.0% reported having had at least one of the symptoms. CONCLUSIONS. The SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Lithuanian sample in August–September 2020 was 1.4%, ranging from 0.8% to 2.4% across municipalities. Given the overall official data, by the end of study (11 September 2020) the total COVID-19 rate in Lithuania was 117.5 per 100,000 population or 0.12%. This suggests more than 10 times higher prevalence of virus across the population than the official estimates.","Šmigelskas, Kastytis; Petrikonis, Kęstutis; Kasiulevičius, Vytautas; Kalėdienė, Ramunė; Jakaitienė, Audronė; Kaselienė, Snieguolė; Sauliūnė, Skirmantė; Beržanskytė, Aušra; Stankūnas, Mindaugas",Acta Med Litu,847,13

Recent evidence shows internet-delivered dialectic behaviour therapy (iDBT) skills training can reduce emotional dysregulation and pain intensity. However, further studies are needed to provide more definitive evidence regarding the efficacy of iDBT skills training in the chronic pain population. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A single-case experimental design (SCED) with multiple baselines will be used to examine the efficacy of a 4-week iDBT-Pain skills training intervention (iDBT-Pain intervention) to reduce emotional dysregulation and pain intensity in individuals with chronic pain. The iDBT-Pain intervention encompasses two components: (1) iDBT-Pain skills training sessions (iDBT-Pain sessions) and (2) the iDBT-Pain skills training web application (iDBT-Pain app). Three individuals with chronic pain will be recruited and randomly allocated to different baseline phases (5, 9 or 12 days). Following the baseline phase, participants will receive six 60–90 min iDBT-Pain sessions approximately 4 or 5 days apart, delivered by a psychologist via Zoom. To reinforce learnings from the iDBT-Pain sessions, participants will have unlimited use of the iDBT-Pain app. A 7-day follow-up phase (maintenance) will follow the intervention, whereby the iDBT-Pain sessions cease but the iDBT-Pain app is accessible. Emotional regulation, as the primary outcome measure, will be assessed using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale. Pain intensity, as the secondary outcome measure, will be assessed using a visual analogue scale. Generalisation measures will assess psychological state factors (depression, anxiety and coping behaviour), alongside sleep quality, well-being and harm avoidance. SCEDs are increasingly considered effective designs for internet-delivered psychological interventions because SCED enables the investigation of interindividual variability in a heterogeneous population such as chronic pain. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial was approved by the University of New South Wales (HC200199). Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

Epidemiologically, we find that random fluctuations can suppress disease outbreak, which can provide us some useful control strategies to regulate disease dynamics. In other words, neglecting random perturbations overestimates the ability of the disease to spread.

At present, implementation research has not adequately defined the effectiveness and feasibility of a centralized telepsychiatry consultation service within a multi-hospital healthcare system. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate feasibility of a hub and spoke model for provision of inpatient consult telepsychiatry service from an academic medical center to two affiliated regional hospital sites, to reduce patient wait time, and to develop best practice guidelines for telepsychiatry consultations to the acutely medically ill. METHODS: The implementation, interprofessional workflow, process of triage, and provider satisfaction were described from the first 13 months of the service. RESULTS: This pilot study resulted in 557 completed telepsychiatry consults over the course of 13 months from 2018 to 2019. A range of psychiatric conditions commonly encountered by CL services were diagnosed and treated through the teleconferencing modality. The most common barriers to successful use of telepsychiatry were defined for the 20% of consult requests that were re-triaged to face-to-face evaluation. The average patient wait time from consult request to initial consultation was reduced from > 24 hours to 92 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the feasibility of a centralized telepsychiatry hub to improve delivery of psychiatry consultation within a multi-hospital system with an overall reduction in patient wait time. This work may serve as a model for further design innovation across many healthcare settings and new patient sub-populations.","Shayevitz, Christina; Breitinger, Scott; Lerario, Mackenzie P.; Mroczkowski, Megan; Osuji, Martin; Fleischut, Peter; Khan, Mashal; Murray, Joseph; Wilner, Philip; Sombrotto, Lisa",Psychosomatics,847,28
