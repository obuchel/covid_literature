The cell viability changes of four bacteria species (Escherichia coli K12 JM109; Acinetobacter sp. 5A5; Pseudomonas oleovorans X5; and Staphylococcus aureus X8), three Gram-negative and one Gram-positive, in a large evaporating droplet of size 1,800 μm in diameter on teflon-coated slides were measured using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight solution and a microscope. Droplets of three levels of salinity (0, 0.9, and 36% w/v) were tested. All four species survived well during the droplet evaporation process, but died mostly at the time when droplets were dried out at 40–45 min. The final bacteria survival rate after droplets were completely dried was dependent on bacteria species and the salinity of the suspension solution. Droplet evaporation over the first 35–40 min had no adverse effect on bacterial survival for the droplets tested. The lethal effect of desiccation was found to be the most important death mechanism.","Xie, Xiaojian; Li, Yuguo; Zhang, Tong; Fang, Herbert H. P.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,454,1

This combination can be considered as a bioreactor that is produced by introducing foreign genes into plants that elicit special immunogenicity when introduced into animals or human beings. In comparison with traditional vaccines, plant vaccines have some significant advantages, such as low cost, greater safety, and greater effectiveness. In a number of recent studies, antigen-specific proteins have been successfully expressed in various plant tissues and have even been tested in animals and human beings. Therefore, edible vaccines of transgenic plants have a bright future. This review begins with a discussion of the immune mechanism and expression systems for transgenic plant vaccines. Then, current advances in different transgenic plant vaccines will be analyzed, including vaccines against pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotic parasites. In view of the low expression levels for antigens in plants, high-level expression strategies of foreign protein in transgenic plants are recommended. Finally, the existing safety problems in transgenic plant vaccines were put forward will be discussed along with a number of appropriate solutions that will hopefully lead to future clinical application of edible plant vaccines.","Guan, Zheng-jun; Guo, Bin; Huo, Yan-lin; Guan, Zheng-ping; Dai, Jia-kun; Wei, Ya-hui",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,454,22

In the majority of patients the disease has taken a mild clinical course. However, in isolated cases severe complications requiring hospitalization or intensive care treatment have occurred. Most of the current recommendations refer to outpatients or mild diseases and are not always suitable and practicable for the management of a life-threatening influenza A/H1N1v infection in an intensive care setting. The aim of this review is to present a reliable diagnostic and therapeutic approach for critically ill patients, considering the current literature, case-based experiences from our own intensive care unit and including relevant recommendations of public health authorities. Initial measures regarding therapeutic, diagnostic and isolation precautions arise from past medical history, current anamnesis and characteristic symptoms and their progression. Patients suspected of having acquired an influenza A/H1N1v infection should be isolated. Early laboratory diagnosis of A/H1N1v infection ideally utilizes the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as the most sensitive diagnostic method. Emerging evidence suggests that incidence and severity of life-threatening influenza A/H1N1v infection increase with several risk factors (e.g. pregnancy, immunosuppression, obesity). Treatment decisions should not be delayed to await laboratory confirmation in these patients as early initiation of antiviral therapy is recommended. Elements of supportive care depend on the presentation of complications and secondary organ failure. If rapidly progressive lung dysfunction occurs, refractory to routine mechanical ventilation, early reporting to centers experienced in the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) should be established.","Bürkle, M.A.; Frey, L.; Zwißler, B.",Anaesthesist,454,1

In humans, the major classes of host defence peptides include the α- and β-defensins and the cathelicidin, hCAP-18/LL-37. These peptides are expressed in the granules of neutrophils and by a wide variety of tissue types. They have many roles in the immune response including both indirect and direct antimicrobial activity, the ability to act as chemokines as well as induce chemokine production leading to recruitment of leukocytes to the site of infection, the promotion of wound healing and an ability to modulate adaptive immunity. It appears that many of these properties are mediated though direct interaction of peptides with the cells of the innate immune response including monocytes, dendritic cells, T cells and epithelial cells. The importance of these peptides in immune responses has been demonstrated since animals defective in the expression of certain host defence peptides showgreater susceptibility to bacterial infections. In the very few instances in which human patients have been demonstrated to have defective host defence peptide expression, these individuals suffer from frequent infections. Although studies of the immunomodulatory properties of these peptides are in their infancy, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the immunomodulatory properties of these small, naturally occurring molecules might be harnessed for development as novel therapeutic agents.","Bowdish, D.

To understand the success of the norm of universal antiretroviral access, I examine the failure of an earlier health-related norm — that of universal primary health care. The campaign for universal antiretroviral access points to a need for a more nuanced understanding of norm evolution within the international community and a more holistic vision of which actors can facilitate the realization of a norm.","Youde, Jeremy",J Int Relat Dev (Ljubl),454,1

This was a prospective cohort study of pediatric patients diagnosed with congenital heart disease who underwent heart surgery and used NIV. Data were collected from 170 patients with a median age of 2 months. No patient presented cardiorespiratory arrest nor any other complication during the use of NIV. The success rate for the use of NIV was 61.8%. Subjects were divided for analysis into successful and failed NIV groups. Statistical analysis used Chi-square, Mann–Whitney, and Student’s t tests, which were performed after univariate and multivariate logistic regression for p < 0.05. In the multivariate analysis, only the minimal pressure gradient (OR 1.45 with p = 0.007), maximum oxygen saturation (OR 0.88 with p = 0.011), and maximum fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) (OR 1.16 with p < 0.001) influenced NIV failure. The following variables did not present a statistical difference: extracorporeal circulation time (p = 0.669), pulmonary hypertension (p = 0.254), genetic syndrome (p = 0.342), RACHS-1 score (p = 0.097), age (p = 0.098), invasive mechanical ventilation duration (p = 0.186), and NIV duration (p = 0.804). In conclusion, NIV can be successfully used in children who, after cardiac surgery, develop respiratory failure in the 48 h following extubation. Although the use of higher pressure gradients and higher FiO(2) are associated with a greater failure rate for NIV use, it was found to be generally safe.","S. Rolim, Denise; Galas, Filomena R.

Here, we propose a novel coordinate system of the human cortex based on an advanced model of its connectivity. Our approach is inspired by seminal, but so far largely neglected models of cortico–cortical wiring established by postmortem anatomical studies and capitalises on cutting-edge in vivo neuroimaging and machine learning. The new model expands the currently prevailing diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tractography approach by incorporation of additional features of cortical microstructure and cortico–cortical proximity. Studying several datasets and different parcellation schemes, we could show that our coordinate system robustly recapitulates established sensory-limbic and anterior–posterior dimensions of brain organisation. A series of validation experiments showed that the new wiring space reflects cortical microcircuit features (including pyramidal neuron depth and glial expression) and allowed for competitive simulations of functional connectivity and dynamics based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and human intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) coherence. Our results advance our understanding of how cell-specific neurobiological gradients produce a hierarchical cortical wiring scheme that is concordant with increasing functional sophistication of human brain organisation. Our evaluations demonstrate the cortical wiring space bridges across scales of neural organisation and can be easily translated to single individuals.","Paquola, Casey; Seidlitz, Jakob; Benkarim, Oualid; Royer, Jessica; Klimes, Petr; Bethlehem, Richard A.

In spite of antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal prophylaxis, reduced host defenses render the HSCT patient vulnerable to pulmonary and other infections in the early weeks and even months post-transplantation. This chapter suggests an integrative approach followed by a description of the most common pulmonary syndromes seen in HSCT patients, including diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS), bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP). The high risk of developing pulmonary complications after HSCT necessitates a pre-transplant pulmonary workup. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are done prior to HSCT and include spirometry and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO). Low DLCO and alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient on PFTs carry increased mortality post-HSCT. Decreased DLCO and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) < 80 % are indicators of developing respiratory failure post-HSCT. Investigating new pulmonary complaints is challenging. All patients should undergo an extensive workup of new pulmonary findings, including dyspnea, cough, fever, and hypoxia. In the first 4–6 weeks post-HSCT, immunocompromised patients can develop bacterial pneumonia. Pathogens include gram-negative rods (Pseudomonas or Klebsiella), Staphylococcus aureus, and Nocardia. While chest X-rays could show typical lobar or multilobar opacities, computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest (noncontrast CT scans are adequate for workup of infectious processes) may yield additional characteristic findings (nodules, ground glass opacities, etc.). Fungal pneumonias, primarily aspergillus, can also develop in this early period. There is a very strong association between invasive Aspergillus pneumonia and neutropenia lasting more than 10 days. Viral pneumonia may develop as well in this patient population; however, it tends to occur later. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common viral pathogen, but with monitoring and preemptive therapy, the incidence has declined. Other viruses have emerged as pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, parainfluenza, and human metapneumovirus (see Chap. 17).","Moulton, Bart; Barker, Alan F.",Blood and Marrow Transplant Handbook,454,1

We theoretically and empirically show that the network growth models which are solely based on degree and/or intrinsic fitness cannot realize certain temporal growth behaviors that are observed in real-world citation networks. To this end, we propose two new growth models that localize the influence of papers through an appropriate attachment mechanism. Experimental results on the real-world citation networks of Computer Science and Physics domains show that our proposed models can better explain the temporal behavior of citation networks than existing models.","Mohapatra, Dattatreya; Pal, Siddharth; De, Soham; Kumaraguru, Ponnurangam; Chakraborty, Tanmoy",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,454,1

Indeed, although AI allows us to address and solve very difficult and complicated problems, AI-based tools act as a black box and, usually, do not explain how/why/when a specific decision has been taken. Among AI models, Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems (FRBSs) are recognized world-wide as transparent and interpretable tools: they can provide explanations in terms of linguistic rules. Moreover, FRBSs may achieve accuracy comparable to those achieved by less transparent models, such as neural networks and statistical models. In this work, we introduce SK-MOEFS (acronym of SciKit-Multi Objective Evolutionary Fuzzy System), a new Python library that allows the user to easily and quickly design FRBSs, employing Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms. Indeed, a set of FRBSs, characterized by different trade-offs between their accuracy and their explainability, can be generated by SK-MOEFS.

We present a 9-year-old Caucasian boy who, early in the pandemic, became PCR positive and was admitted to paediatric intensive care (PICU) with an adult phenotype of hyperinflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He has trisomy 21 and last year was admitted to PICU with ARDS and macrophage activation syndrome. We share how this early case influenced our thinking and subsequent management of cases thought to have PIMS-TS. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: He presented to a district hospital on March 31st with fever and persistent cough without respiratory or other compromise. Discharged home with oral antibiotics, he obtunded within 18 h and returned as an emergency with persistent fever, cough, and haemoptysis with Sa0(2) 77% in 15litres oxygen. Following intubation, a large pulmonary haemorrhage made ventilation difficult and three cardiac arrests occurred prior to transfer on inotropic support. On arrival, results showed Lymphocytes 1.2, Hb 104, Platelets 365, Ferritin 2059, INR 1.2, Procalcitonin (PCT) 43.84, CRP 219, CK 296, LDH 2035, Albumin 35, D-dimer 37.55. SARS-COV2 was confirmed in endotracheal secretions. All other microbiology investigations remained negative other than a scanty growth of Candida. Radiology demonstrated bilateral opacifications and pleural effusions. Blood film was consistent with the clinical picture with no signs of malignancy. Subsequent key results included cytopenia with troughs of Hb 86, Lymphocytes 0.2, Platelets 84; peak Ferritin 6283, d-dimer 50.60 and PCT >100, plateauing by day 7. He was ventilated for 23 days requiring high pressures (PIP consistently >30), nitric oxide and inotropes. There was no clinical improvement despite optimal supportive treatment, but immunomodulation was held during repeat microbiology investigation and concern for losing a fine care balance. However, when formally considering ECMO, a trial of Anakinra 4 mg/kg increasing to 8 mg/kg twice daily over 4 days (day 5–9) was commenced. The inflammatory markers had already plateaued then started to fall and there was no meaningful respiratory improvement with anakinra. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was administered day 9–10, but improvement in respiratory function only occurred with IV methylprednisolone 10 mg/kg/dose when (days 16–18) the team felt immunomodulation was safe and data from adult intensive care was supportive. He transferred to the ward on day 30 and discharged to his local hospital on day 83. PCR remained positive until day 32. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: As in other children with evidence of SARS-COV2, this child showed a rapid and unpredictable decline in condition, but he presented with an opportunity for prevention of the ensuing hyperinflammation. There is a need for research to identify a fingerprint of inflammation that predicts subsequent decline and the value of prompt, safe immunomodulation to distract from critical cytokine cascades. It is unclear why this boy was one of very few children to develop an adult phenotype but given an altered immune state associated with trisomy 21 and a previous episode of ARDS with hyperinflammation it would suggest that inherent Trisomy 21 genetic risk factors may be involved. He also had previously been identified to features of chronic lung disease that was a contributing factor. Successful management of this child resulted from rigorous organ support and close collaboration between consultants and junior staff in PICU, infectious diseases and rheumatology. This was the beginning of a critical relationship that allowed rapid sharing of information and concerns to maintain safety and explore differentials and treatment strategies. A decision to commence immunomodulation had to consider the fragile state of support and risk; for instance, from fluid overload, the background risk of infection and neoplasia and professionals understanding of drug safety. Anakinra was used first due to a short half-life, extensive safety data in toxic shock and routine use in rheumatology. IVIG was delayed due to fluid volume, but neither this nor anakinra had a meaningful clinical effect. The key response to steroids is like that reported in adults including the RECOVERY trial. Other learning points showed unexpected patterns and limited utility of blood investigations, as seen later in PIMS-TS. This included incongruence in peaks of ferritin and LDH and delayed recovery of cell lines except Hb which was an early signal of improvement. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: A collaborative approach across teams during the care of this patient was critical and primed relationships prior to the surge of PIMS-TS cases. The role of rheumatology has been clearly defined by its familiarity with the benefit and safety of immunomodulatory agents, which has enabled support of intensive care and infectious disease teams in their use. This patient may also have highlighted a predisposition in some cohorts to states of hyperinflammation given his previous episode last year. Is this due to his trisomy 21 and suspected immune dysregulation or other factors, as we know these patients are at an increased risk of infections and autoimmune conditions? Clinical course in children is unpredictable and frequently associated with rapid decline. Teams must remain flexible and able to respond with different treatment strategies as cases continue to evolve. Here there was an adult phenotype and supportive treatment remained key. As in adult care the benefit of steroids in ventilated patients was clear. However, ongoing research is required to examine the safety (and benefit) of early immunomodulation use when other differentials (including sepsis and malignancy) have not been fully or reliably excluded. There is an argument to use immunomodulation early in the presentation of similar patients in the future. Further molecular biological studies such as the DIAMOND study may help us identify key inflammatory pathways and subsequently screening tools to inform such initial treatment and avoid the rapid decline and hospital or PICU admission. Each immunomodulator has distinct characteristics and response to treatment is not predictable. Does this inform treatment algorithms in the absence of evidence from trials? In the absence of trials for this phenotype should treatment follow an adult based algorithm. We hope that by sharing this case it will stimulate further discussion and research to help us treat future similar patients.","Paterson-Brown, Lucy; Brighouse, James; Wilkinson, Nick",Rheumatol Adv Pract,454,1

Despite intensive research efforts in the field, there is still no evidence available for routine cardioprotective prophylaxis to prevent cardiotoxicity in the majority of oncological patients at low risk of cardiovascular disease. We have recently demonstrated the advantages of a prophylactic, combined heart failure therapy in an experimental model of DOX-induced cardiomyopathy. In the current work, we focus on individually applied prophylactic medications studied in the same translational environment to clarify their distinct roles in the prevention of DOX cardiotoxicity. METHODS: Twelve-week-old male Wistar rats were divided into 5 subgroups. Prophylactic β-blocker (BB, bisoprolol), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI, perindopril) or aldosterone antagonist (AA, eplerenone) treatments were applied 1 week before DOX administration, then 6 cycles of intravenous DOX chemotherapy were administered. Rats receiving only intravenous DOX or saline served as positive and negative controls. Blood pressure, heart rate, body weight, and echocardiographic parameters were monitored in vivo. Two months after the last DOX administration, the animals were sacrificed, and their heart and serum samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen for histological, mechanical, and biochemical measurements. RESULTS: All prophylactic treatments increased the survival of DOX-receiving animals. The lowest mortality rates were seen in the BB and ACEI groups. The left ventricular ejection fraction was only preserved in the BB group. The DOX-induced increase in the isovolumetric relaxation time could not be prevented by any prophylactic treatment. A decreased number of apoptotic nuclei and a preserved myocardial ultrastructure were found in all groups receiving prophylactic cardioprotection, while the DOX-induced fibrotic remodelling and the increase in caspase-3 levels could only be substantially prevented by the BB and ACEI treatments. CONCLUSION: Primary prophylaxis with cardioprotective agents like BB or ACEI has a key role in the prevention of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in healthy rats. Future human studies are necessary to implement this finding in the clinical management of oncological patients free of cardiovascular risk factors.","Lódi, Mária; Bánhegyi, Viktor; Bódi, Beáta; Gyöngyösi, Alexandra; Kovács, Árpád; Árokszállási, Anita; Hamdani, Nazha; Fagyas, Miklós; Édes, István; Csanádi, Zoltán; Czuriga, István; Kisvárday, Zoltán; Lekli, István; Bai, Péter; Tóth, Attila; Papp, Zoltán; Czuriga, Dániel",J Transl Med,454,1

This process - that also affected north-south trades - has crucial implications in the shipping business, particularly in the planning of ports and its services and related activities. This paper analyses the global increase in vessel size and forecasts larger vessels’ arrival to South American coasts. The paper analyses evidence since 2006 to understand the factors behind the trend for bigger ships (fleets between 18,000 and 24,000 TEU) and introduce a validated methodology for the prediction of the size of container ships. Experts presented a consensus vision in which factors associated with infrastructure, economics, technology, and the environment play a crucial role in driving the trend. Next, the paper presents a methodology for forecasting the size of containerships and applies it to Latin America’s trade. The models include two alternative thresholds for the dependent variables (1310 ft LOA and 18,000 TEU of nominal capacity) that are controlled by cascading effect (i.e., the size gap between Latin America and the world’s main trade routes), and the economic activity at the destination countries (represented by port activity). Finally, the conclusions highlight the forecast’s call to take action on infrastructure planning and investments, analyzing issues such as “economies of scale,” concentration, or entry barriers.

RESULTS: Forty-nine patients were admitted for tetanus (mean age, 67.0 years [range, 53.0–80.0 years]; 32 women [57.1%]). All the patients had generalized tetanus, and 5 (10.2%) died during hospitalization. The median duration from symptom onset to hospital admission was 4 days. Trismus (85.7%) was the most common symptom, and the median hospital stay was 39 days. Thirty-two patients (65.3%) required mechanical ventilation, and 20 (40.8%) developed aspiration pneumonia. The median total healthcare cost per patient was US $18,011. After discharge, 35 patients (71.4%) recovered sufficiently to walk without disability. CONCLUSIONS: Tetanus requires long hospital stays and high medical expenditures in South Korea; however, the vaccination completion rate is low. Medical staff should therefore promote medical advice and policies on the management of tetanus to the general South Korean population.","Bae, Sohyun; Go, Minsik; Kim, Yoonjung; Hwang, Soyoon; Kim, Shin-Woo; Kwon, Ki Tae; Jung, Sook-In; Chang, Hyun-Ha",BMC Infect Dis,454,5

Through the case of South Africa’s pharmaceutical industry, this analysis demonstrates the challenge for local manufacturing to compete, and the associated state policy responses, in a place which is largely plugged into GVCs as an end market rather than as a production location. As multinationals have concentrated production elsewhere, South Africa’s manufacturing capacity in the pharmaceutical industry has relatively declined in recent decades. Having struggled in its facilitator role, the South African state’s efforts to promote local manufacturing have turned to the producer role through a state-owned company and especially the buyer role through public procurement. Motivations for state policy in this context, however, must navigate the tension which sometimes exists between the industrial interest in local manufacturing and the consumer and health policy interest in access to medicines. The experience of South Africa’s pharmaceutical industry points to the wider challenge and consequences of import-oriented engagement with GVCs for local industrial development.","Horner, Rory",J Int Bus Policy,454,1

Different measures have been taken to control and manage the outbreak of COVID-19 in these countries. There are two propositions in context of effective control and management of a pandemic like COVID-19. First, a strong and effective public health care system is essential for managing the public health crisis and the uneven responses to COVID-19 are mainly because of inadequate health infrastructure. Second, the spread of COVID-19 depends on the interplay of other social determinants at local level, and therefore, addressing the gaps in social determinants of COVID-19 at local level is critical to control and manage this pandemic. The present paper attempts to examine these two propositions in Indian context at states and districts level, respectively. Using the cross-sectional data and constructing composite indices of COVID-19 intensity and level of health infrastructure at state level, the results show that there is no robust relationship between level of health infrastructure and management of COVID-19 at state level as the states with better health infrastructure are also struggling to combat against COVID-19. The district-level analysis indicates a significant relationship between concentration of COVID-19 and social determinants as majority of the districts with higher concentration of COVID-19 are those which have social determinants below national average.","Pandey, Arvind; Prakash, Aseem; Agur, Rajeev; Maruvada, Ganesh",J,454,22

However, the relationships are not well characterized among higher education students, and investigations into why these relationships exist are lacking. As FS influences sleep while sleep influences dietary behaviors, sleep may serve as a mediator in these relationships. The current study examined whether poor sleep quality and short sleep duration mediate the relationship between FS and overall dietary risk behavior (ODRB) among higher education students in the U.S during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled students at three large universities in the U.S. between April-May 2020. Eligible students filled out online surveys comprised of validated tools to assess FS, sleep quality and duration, and ODRB. ODRB was measured using the Starting the Conversation questionnaire, which measures eating frequencies of fast foods, fruits, vegetables, soda and sweet tea, high quality proteins, chips and crackers, dessert, and solid fat and provides a global score of ODRB. A higher score indicates more risk behaviors. Multivariate linear regressions were conducted for unadjusted and adjusted estimates, and mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS Macro in SPSS 26. RESULTS: A total of 1280 students completed the survey. Higher FS was associated with higher ODRB scores (P = 0.002). The mediation analyses revealed that higher FS was associated with poorer sleep quality (P < 0.001) and shorter sleep duration (P = 0.043). In addition, poorer sleep quality (P = 0.013) and shorter sleep duration (P = 0.005) were both associated with higher ODRB scores. Further, poor sleep quality (B = 0.012, 95% CI 0.002, 0.022) and short sleep duration (B = −0.011, 95% CI −0.007 to −0.0003) mediated the relationship between FS and ODRB scores. CONCLUSIONS: FS and ODRB scores were positively correlated, and this relationship was associated with poor sleep quality and short sleep duration. These results suggest that improving sleep quality and duration may serve as key components of interventions that reduce dietary risk behaviors among U.S. higher education students when experiencing high FS.

AIM: The aim of this study was to explore and describe the lived experiences of emergency care personnel in managing paediatric patients in the pre-hospital environment and to understand the meaning and the significance of these experiences. SETTING: All participants were purposively sampled from emergency medical services agencies operating within the Johannesburg metropolitan city area. METHODS: This study followed a qualitative, exploratory, descriptive, phenomenological design, whereby participants purposively sampled within the Johannesburg metropolitan city voluntarily consented to one-on-one interviews (n = 10). RESULTS: Three main themes, with 11 contributing categories, were identified and contextualised with available literature. Emerging from the main themes was an overall sense that managing paediatric emergencies is a negative experience, coloured with feelings of inadequacy, stress, anxiety and even fear. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study provided new insights into what South African EMS are experiencing when managing paediatric emergencies, which enables future research efforts to identify research and practice gaps that are relevant to paediatric pre-hospital emergency care, and that are specific to the South African environment.

After preliminary screening of the identified articles through title and abstract, 249 were selected. Consequently, 167 full-text articles were assessed and reviewed based on our inclusion criteria and thus 20 articles were regarded as eligible and analyzed in the present analysis. All the studies included adult population aged between 18 and above 60 years. The median length of hospital stay of the COVID-19 patients during the acute infection phase ranged from 8 days to 17 days. The most common prevalent long-term symptoms in COVID-19 patients included persistent fatigue and dyspnea in almost all of the studies. Other reported common symptoms included: shortness of breath, cough, joint pain, chest pain or tightness, headache, loss of smell/taste, sore throat, diarrhea, loss of memory, depression, anxiety. Associated cardiovascular events included arrhythmias, palpitations and hypotension, increased HR, venous thromboembolic diseases, myocarditis, and acute/decompensated heart failure as well. Among neurological manifestations headache, peripheral neuropathy symptoms, memory issues, concentration, and sleep disorders were most commonly observed with varying frequencies. Mental health issues affecting mental abilities, mood fluctuations namely anxiety and depression, and sleep disorders were commonly seen. Further, diarrhea, vomiting, digestive disorders, and Loss of appetite or weight loss are common gastrointestinal manifestations. Therefore, appropriate clinical evaluation is required in long COVID cases which in turn may help us to identify the risk factors, etiology, and to my help, we treat them early with appropriate management strategies.","Ahmad, M S; Shaik, R A; Ahmad, R K; Yusuf, M; Khan, M; Almutairi, A B; Alghuyaythat, W K Z; Almutairi, S B",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,454,1

The study compares the strength of mesh fixation between the IMT and another commercial tack (ACT) device - Absorbatack™ (Covidien, Corp, Mansfield, MA, USA). MATERIAL AND METHODS Strips of mesh were installed on the abodminal wall of three pigs. Half of the meshes were fixated by IMT and half by ACT. Euthanasia was done immediately to the first pig, after14 days to the second and after 27 days to the third pig. The mesh strips were pulled while fixation force was measured. Statistical analysis was done using the two tailed t-test. All mesh strips were found to be fixated. Through detachment force test, the average force in the first pig was 17.1N ± 1.9 and 16.5N ± 8.3 (IMT and ACT respectively, n/s). The average force in the second pig was 18.8N ± 7.3 and 8.4N ± 4.1 (IMT and ACT respectively, p < 0.05).

SUMMARY INTRODUCTION As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the management of paediatric appendicitis has changed (open instead of laparoscopic appendectomy, antibiotic treatment). The number of complicated appendicitis cases increased worldwide. OBJECTIVE Our aim was to study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric acute appendicitis: has there been more perforated cases? METHODS Children operated because of acute appendicitis between 2012 and 2020 were studied. Cases from the year 2020 were analysed monthly. Patients were divided into perforated and non-perforated appendicitis groups according to their histological findings. COVID-19 status of patients in 2020 was studied. Chi2 test for trend and Fisher's exact test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS In the study period, 1343 appendectomies were performed. The majority of our cases were non-perforated (1166/1343). The rate of perforated appendicitis cases has been increasing from 2015 (p = 0.0002). The number of perforated cases was higher in COVID-19 positive patients (5/8) then in negative ones (15/92) (p = 0.0075). DISCUSSION In line with the international trend, more perforated appendicitis cases were treated in our departement in 2020. However, this increase started in 2015, and there is no correlation with the COVID-19 pandemic. The cause of the increased number of perforated cases in COVID-19 positive appendicitis patients is unknown. CONCLUSION The causes of the high proportion of perforated cases in COVID-19 positive patients and the rising rate of perforated appendicitis cases since 2015 need further studies.

Methods An online survey consisting of 19 questions was created using SurveyMonkey. Cat owners were invited to participate through advertisements in veterinary clinics and social media. Results The average number of cats in a household was two. The majority of cats lived in free-standing houses (78%) in the suburbs (66%). The majority of cats were desexed (94% [49% female neutered; 45% male neutered]). A total of 57% of cats had been strays or came from an animal shelter. A total of 40% of owners had intended not to let the cats outside when they first acquired them. A total of 63% of cats were described as indoor-outdoor cats. Although owners described 34% of cats as 'indoor only', 58% of those cats had access to the outdoors. The majority of respondents' cats were vaccinated annually (63%) and visited a vet at least annually (79%). The most common reasons to take a cat to the vet were vaccinations or the cat being unwell. The most common reasons not to regularly take the cat to the vet were that the cat was never unwell, cost or stress for the cat. Conclusions and relevance Consideration of the lifestyle of cats is important to optimise veterinary care. Cats across Australia and New Zealand have a variety of different and changing lifestyles. Therefore, careful owner questioning is required at each visit to maximise healthcare outcomes for cats.","Johnston, Laura; Szczepanski, Julia; McDonagh, Phillip",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,454,1

Despite their simplicity, these models are robust to predict the kernel of real situations. In this work, we review concisely both processes that are well-known and very applied examples of models that exhibit absorbing-state phase transitions. In the epidemic scenario, individuals can be infected or susceptible. A phase transition between a disease-free (absorbing) state and an active stationary phase (where a fraction of the population is infected) are separated by an epidemic threshold. For the SIS model, the central issue is to determine this epidemic threshold on heterogeneous networks.

Consequently, gene expression data beyond embryonic and larval stages become more important, yet there is a dramatic knowledge gap of gene expression beyond day four of development. Like in other model organisms, the visualization of spatial and temporal gene expression by whole mount in situ hybridization (ISH) becomes increasingly difficult when zebrafish embryos develop further and hence the growing tissues become dense and less permeable. Here we introduce a modified method for whole mount ISH, which overcomes these penetration and detection problem. The method is an all in one solution that enables the detection and visualization of gene expression patterns up to the late larval stage in a 3D manner without the need for tissue sectioning and offers a valuable extension for whole mount ISH by immunohistochemistry in the zebrafish field.","Vauti, Franz; Stegemann, Luisa A; Vögele, Viktoria; Köster, Reinhard W",PloS one,454,31

We consider explanations for this phenomenon, including prolonged high striving, competing demands between the environments upwardly mobile individuals seek to enter and their environments of origin, cultural mismatches between adaptive strategies from their childhood environments and those that are valued in higher-SES environments, and the sense of alienation, lack of belonging, and discrimination that upwardly mobile individuals face as they move into spaces set up by and for high-SES groups.

In the present work, based on the mechanism of the four-way DNA branch migration cascades, we constructed a simple and effective signal amplification strategy for aptamer-based sensitive detection of MUC1. The specific binding of MUC1 to the aptamer sequence in the hairpin probe unfolds and switches its structure, triggering the formation of the DNA Holliday junction structure for cascaded branch migrations with the assistance of two fuel DNA duplexes. Importantly, a target analogue DNA complex can be generated in such processes for recycling the branch migration reactions for the production of substantial amounts of G-quadruplexes, which can bind the thioflavin T dye to show significantly intensified fluorescence for detecting MUC1 with a low detection limit of 2.8 nM without the involvement of any labels or enzymes. In addition, this detection strategy could be successfully applied to monitor the target MUC1 in diluted human serums with a high selectivity and acceptable accuracy to demonstrate its potential application for real samples with the advantages of simplicity and signal amplification capability.","Peng, Ying; Yang, Fang; Li, Xiaolong; Jiang, Bingying; Yuan, Ruo; Xiang, Yun",The Analyst,454,1

The aim of the study is to compare the appropriateness of uncuffed ETT selection based on modified Cole's formula with that of ultrasound assessment method of subglottic diameter in children undergoing surgical procedures under general anesthesia. MATERIAL AND METHODS This is a prospective, randomized, parallel group study. One hundred and fifty American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II patients of age 2-6 years were randomly allotted into two groups: Group A - ETT selection based on ultrasound assessment of subglottic diameter. Group B - ETT selection based on modified Cole's formula. The study parameters are the internal diameter and external diameter (OD) of the predicted ETT by the two methods and that of the appropriate size ETT used. RESULTS The incidence of appropriate tube selection was 74.7% in the ultrasound based group while it was 45.3% in the modified Cole's formula group. There was a strong correlation between OD of the optimal ETT used and the ultrasound assessed subglottic diameter. Bland-Altman analysis of OD of appropriately sized ETT and subglottic diameter by ultrasound assessment has a bias of 0.02 mm with limits of agreement of +1.78 to -1.74. CONCLUSION Ultrasonographic assessment of the subglottic diameter at the cricoid region is a better tool in predicting the appropriate size uncuffed ETT than modified Cole's formula.","Gnanaprakasam, Pughal Vendan; Selvaraj, Venkatesh","Journal of anaesthesiology, clinical pharmacology",454,1

The study aims were to describe and compare the presence of depressive symptoms in female university students with and without dysmenorrhoea and to infer which factors may influence dysmenorrhoea. METHODS This case-control study included 942 students, 471 in each group. The case group consisted of university students in a large university hospital in Eastern Turkey who applied to the adult emergency service and were diagnosed with dysmenorrhoea. The control group consisted of randomly selected students in the same university who did not report painful menstruation. The data were collected between September 2015 and May 2016 using a questionnaire. RESULTS Depressive symptoms were observed in 61.1% of the students with dysmenorrhoea and 38.9% of the students without dysmenorrhoea (P < .05). The logistic regression analysis showed that depressive symptoms (OR: 1.87) and family history of dysmenorrhoea (OR: 2.20) were found to be higher in the students with dysmenorrhoea than in the students without dysmenorrhoea. CONCLUSION Students with dysmenorrhoea were more likely to have depressive symptoms and a family history of dysmenorrhoea; findings alert health care professionals to the psychological as well as physiological effects.","Uçar, Tuba; Timur Taşhan, Sermin; Aksoy Derya, Yeşim; Nacar, Gülçin",International journal of nursing practice,454,30

In line with this trend, considering the proven biological importance of 1,2,4-triazoles, herein, we are reporting the design, synthesis, pharmacokinetic profiles, and in vitro anticancer activity of novel C3-linked 1,2,4-triazole-N-arylamide hybrids and their in silico proposed mechanism of action via inhibition of STAT3. The 1,2,4-triazole scaffold was selected as a privilege ring system that is embedded in core structures of a variety of anticancer drugs which are either in clinical use or still under clinical trials. The designed 1,2,4-triazole derivatives were synthesized by linking the triazole-thione moiety through amide hydrophilic linkers with diverse lipophilic fragments. In silico study to predict cytotoxicity of the new hybrids against different kinds of human cancer cell lines as well as the non-tumor cells was conducted. The multidrug-resistant human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MDA-MB-231) was found most susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of synthesized compounds and hence were selected to evaluate the in vitro anticancer activity. Four of the designed derivatives showed promising cytotoxicity effects against selected cancer cells, among which compound 12 showed the highest potency (IC50 = 3.61 µM), followed by 21 which displayed IC50 value of 3.93 µM. Also, compounds 14 and 23 revealed equipotent activity with the reference cytotoxic agent doxorubicin. To reinforce these observations, the obtained data of in vitro cytotoxicity have been validated in terms of ligand-protein interaction and new compounds were analyzed for ADMET properties to evaluate their potential to build up as good drug candidates. This study led us to identify two novel C3-linked 1,2,4-triazole-N-arylamide hybrids of interesting antiproliferative potentials as probable lead inhibitors of STAT3 with promising pharmacokinetic profiles.","Turky, Abdallah; Bayoumi, Ashraf H; Sherbiny, Farag F; El-Adl, Khaled; Abulkhair, Hamada S",Molecular diversity,454,1

Nevertheless, the precise biological role and underlying mechanisms of BUB1B in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain indistinct. METHOD To figure out the role of BUB1B in HCC, we first assessed its expression using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases. We then verified BUB1B expression in HCC tissues, nontumor tissues, and HCC cell lines through western blotting, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. To explore the specific function of BUB1B in HCC in vivo and in vitro, we performed the flow cytometry, Cell Counting Kit-8, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation, colony formation, Transwell, wound-healing, subcutaneous tumor growth, and metastasis assays. Additionally, we identified the BUB1B-regulated pathways involved in HCC by using gene set enrichment analysis. RESULTS Our data displayed that higher BUB1B expression was detected in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines. The overexpression of BUB1B was positively correlated with adverse clinicopathological characteristics. Survival analyses showed that lower recurrence-free and overall survival rates were correlated with the overexpression of BUB1B in patients with HCC. Moreover, the malignancy of HCC was facilitated by BUB1B both in vivo and in vitro. Lastly, the results were confirmed by western blots, which showed that BUB1B upregulated mTORC1 signaling pathway in HCC. Meanwhile, the oncogenic effect of BUB1B will be impaired when the mTORC1 signaling pathway was inhibited by rapamycin. CONCLUSION We highlighted that BUB1B played an oncogenic role in HCC and was identified as a possible clinical prognostic factor and a potential novel therapeutic target for HCC.","Qiu, Jiannan; Zhang, Shaopeng; Wang, Peng; Wang, Hao; Sha, Bowen; Peng, Hao; Ju, Zheng; Rao, Jianhua; Lu, Ling",Cancer medicine,454,1

A final understanding of pathological process mechanisms is the goal of the scientific community. Summarizing research data from different countries, it became obvious that in severe cases of viral infection, we are dealing with a combination of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Thrombotic microangiopathy is represented by a group of different conditions in which thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and multiple organ failure occur. The article reflects the main types of TMA, pathogenesis and principles of therapy. The main participants in the process are described in detail, including the von Willebrand factor and ADAMTS-13. Based on the knowledge available, as well as new data obtained from patients with COVID-19, we proposed possible models for the implementation of conditions such as sepsis, TMA, and DIC in patients with severe new coronavirus infection.

METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted among 190 healthy female undergraduate students at Taibah University, Madinah, Saudi Arabia. Demographic, knowledge and attitudes toward added sugar, dietary intake, and anthropometric data (i.e., height, weight, and waist circumference) were collected during face-to-face interviews. RESULTS Approximately half of the students (n = 106; 55.8%) were aware of the health consequences of excessive intake of added sugar, but only 32.6% (n = 62) reported making an effort to reduce their added sugar intake. The data indicated that 8.42% of the students (n = 16) consumed carbonated soft drinks daily, 15.8% (n = 30) consumed fruit drinks daily, and 45.8% (n = 87) consumed sweets daily. Underweight students consumed higher quantities of added sugar (expressed as percent of total energy intake) compared with students in all other weight status groups. Results showed negative associations between percentage of added sugar intake and intakes of fiber, iron, zinc, vitamin D, body mass index, and waist circumference. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicated that a large proportion of young women had limited knowledge on the health consequences of excessive added sugar intakes. The observed inverse relationships between added sugar and micronutrient intakes and the weight status highlight the urgent need for expanded efforts to improve added sugar-related knowledge and promote the reduction of added sugar intake among young women.","Mumena, Walaa A; Alamri, Asma A; Mahrous, Alhanouf A; Alharbi, Bushra M; Almohaimeed, Jumanah S; Hakeem, Maysaa I; Kutbi, Hebah A",Nutrition,454,31

81201,81201,81201,Reply by Authors.,10.31593,3.2417648,2019,"INTRODUCTION Various approaches to laparoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) have been developed to reduce pain and other complications, promote recovery, and improve cosmetic outcomes, particularly relative to conventional open or laparoscopic surgery. Three-port procedures for LESS have been reported to be superior to single-port access, but they usually require expensive, technically sophisticated instruments. To avoid these problems, we have developed a modified procedure for performing LESS with a single port, referred to as the ""Obama system."" METHODS From January 2009 through December 2010, we performed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) in 61 patients. Conventional LC with three ports was performed in 39 patients, LESS with a SILS Port was performed in 4 patients, and modified LESS was performed using the Obama system in 18 patients. The operative results were compared. RESULTS LC was successfully completed in all 61 patients, with no postoperative complications. The mean operating time was 102.3 min (C-reactive protein [CRP] ≤ 2) and 160.1 min (CRP > 2) in the 39 patients who underwent conventional LC, 108.3 min (CRP ≤ 2) in the 4 patients who underwent LESS with a SILS Port, and 116.5 min (CRP ≤ 2) and 186.5 min (CRP > 2) in the 18 patients who underwent LESS using the Obama system. No morbidity or mortality was associated with any technique. CONCLUSION The Obama system is easier to use and more efficient and reliable than any other technique currently available for LESS. This system is expected to greatly contribute to the further development and wider acceptance of LESS.","Soma, T; Sugano, M; Ito, T; Kiguchi, G; Tanaka, T; Hattori, Y",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,454,1

Part of conserving this vulnerable and threatened species is maintaining the health of penguins within zoo collections. A variety of cardiovascular diseases has been reported in individuals from the Spheniscidae family including ventricular septal defects, Dirofilaria immitis infection, pulmonary hypertension, and valvular dysplasia, ultimately resulting in congestive heart failure. An accurate clinical picture of cardiovascular disease in Humboldt penguins requires diagnostics tailored to this specific species. The aim of this study was to establish a routine methodology for evaluating the cardiac silhouette of clinically healthy Humboldt penguins using vertebral heart scale (VHS), cardiocoelomic width ratio (CCWR), and a novel cardiac silhouette-to-keel ratio (CKR). Ventrodorsal and right lateral radiographs were taken of 10 mature Humboldt penguins during routine health evaluations. An echocardiographic exam of each penguin was performed to confirm that there was no evidence of cardiac structural remodeling from disease. Two penguins were excluded on the basis of echocardiographic findings; therefore, data from eight penguins were used to calculate objective cardiac measurements for the clinically healthy population. Right lateral radiographs were used to determine VHS (7.4-10.4) and CKR (3.4-4.4). Ventrodorsal radiographs were used for calculating CCWR (0.45-0.59). The excluded penguins had CCWRs that were outside the 95% confidence interval for the range generated by this study. This initial work supports that standardizing radiographic views provides objective measures for cardiac silhouette evaluation in this species. Further research in larger populations and comparison with birds having confirmed cardiac disease is needed to determine the value of these three measurement techniques in Humboldt penguins.","Yunker, Kathrine A; Hostnik, Eric T; Johnson, James G; Giatis, Ioannis Z",Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,454,20

To date, the vast majority of the serological tests for SARS-CoV-2-specific Abs are based on serum detection of Abs to either the viral spike glycoprotein (the major target for neutralizing Abs) or the viral nucleocapsid protein that is known to be highly immunogenic in other coronaviruses. Conceivably, exposure of Ags released from infected cells could stimulate Ab responses that might correlate with tissue damage and, hence, they may have some value as a prognostic indicator. We addressed whether other nonstructural viral proteins, not incorporated into the infectious viral particle, specifically the viral cysteine-like protease, might also be potent immunogens. Using ELISA tests, coating several SARS-CoV-2 proteins produced in vitro, we describe that COVID-19 patients make high titer IgG, IgM, and IgA Ab responses to the Cys-like protease from SARS-CoV-2, also known as 3CLpro or Mpro, and it can be used to identify individuals with positive serology against the coronavirus. Higher Ab titers in these assays associated with more-severe disease, and no cross-reactive Abs against prior betacoronavirus were found. Remarkably, IgG Abs specific for Mpro and other SARS-CoV-2 Ags can also be detected in saliva. In conclusion, Mpro is a potent Ag in infected patients that can be used in serological tests, and its detection in saliva could be the basis for a rapid, noninvasive test for COVID-19 seropositivity.","Martínez-Fleta, Pedro; Alfranca, Arantzazu; González-Álvaro, Isidoro; Casasnovas, Jose M; Fernández-Soto, Daniel; Esteso, Gloria; Cáceres-Martell, Yaiza; Gardeta, Sofía; López-Sanz, Celia; Prat, Salomé; Mateu-Albero, Tamara; Gabrie, Ligia; López-Granados, Eduardo; Sánchez-Madrid, Francisco; Reyburn, Hugh T; Rodríguez Frade, José M; Valés-Gómez, Mar",Journal of immunology,454,16

Cementoblasts, the cells that produce the mineralised tissue, cementum, that is responsible for connecting the soft periodontal tissue to the tooth, are a key cell type for maintaining/restoring tissue attachment following disease. Here we identify two distinct stem cell populations that contribute to cementoblast differentiation at different times. During postnatal development, cementoblasts are formed from perivascular-derived cells expressing CD90 and perivascular-associated cells that express Axin2. During adult homeostasis, only Wnt-responsive Axin2+ cells form cementoblasts but following experimental induction of periodontal disease, CD90+ cells become the main source of cementoblasts. We thus show that different populations resident stem cells are mobilised at different times and during disease to generate precursors for cementoblast differentiation and thus provide an insight into the targeting cells resident cells for novel therapeutic approaches. The differentiation of these stem cells into cementoblasts is however inhibited by bacterial products such as Lipopolysaccharides (LPS), emphasising that regeneration of periodontal ligament (PDL) soft tissue and restoration of attachment will require a multi-pronged approach. © AlphaMed Press 2020 SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In this manuscript, we identified two different stem cell populations that are able to differentiate to cementoblasts in the periodontium. At development stages, both Axin2+ and CD90+ cell populations can give rise to cementoblasts whereas in adult homeostasis, only Axin2+ cell population continue to form cementoblasts. However, the CD90+ cells that normally remain in a quiescent state in adults, can respond during periodontal disease and form cementoblasts, but this stem cell regenerative ability is inhibited by bacterial metabolites. These results have profound implications for the both the use of exogenous cells and mobilization of resident cells as therapies to restore tissue following periodontal disease.","Zhao, Jing; Faure, Louis; Adameyko, Igor; Sharpe, Paul T",Stem cells,454,11

An international Working Party for the Standardization of Bone Marrow IHC was formed by the International Council for Standardization in Hematology (ICSH) to prepare a set of guidelines for the standardization of BM IHC based on currently available published evidence and modern understanding of quality assurance principles as applied to IHC in general. The guidelines were discussed at the ICSH General Assemblies and reviewed by an international panel of experts to achieve further consensus and represent further development of the previously published ICSH guidelines for the standardization of BM specimens handling and reports.","Torlakovic, E E; Brynes, R K; Hyjek, E; Lee, S-H; Kreipe, H; Kremer, M; McKenna, R; Sadahira, Y; Tzankov, A; Reis, M; Porwit, A",International journal of laboratory hematology,454,5

STUDY DESIGN This retrospective cohort study evaluated all patients admitted for delivery from March 22 to April 18, 2020, at two New York City hospitals. Obstetrical and neonatal outcomes were collected. The relationship between COVID-19 and demographic, clinical, and maternal and neonatal outcome data was evaluated. Demographic data included the number of COVID-19 cases ascertained by ZIP code of residence. Adjusted logistic regression models were performed to determine predictability of demographic risk factors for COVID-19. RESULTS Of 454 women delivered, 79 (17%) had COVID-19. Of those, 27.9% (n = 22) had symptoms such as cough (13.9%), fever (10.1%), chest pain (5.1%), and myalgia (5.1%). While women with COVID-19 were more likely to live in the ZIP codes quartile with the most cases (47 vs. 41%) and less likely to live in the ZIP code quartile with the fewest cases (6 vs. 14%), these comparisons were not statistically significant (p = 0.18). Women with COVID-19 were less likely to have a vaginal delivery (55.2 vs. 51.9%, p = 0.04) and had a significantly longer postpartum length of stay with cesarean (2.00 vs. 2.67days, p < 0.01). COVID-19 was associated with higher risk for diagnoses of chorioamnionitis and pneumonia and fevers without a focal diagnosis. In adjusted analyses, including demographic factors, logistic regression demonstrated a c-statistic of 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69, 0.80). CONCLUSION COVID-19 symptoms were present in a minority of COVID-19-positive women admitted for delivery. Significant differences in obstetrical outcomes were found. While demographic risk factors demonstrated acceptable discrimination, risk prediction does not capture a significant portion of COVID-19-positive patients. KEY POINTS · COVID-19 symptoms were present in a minority of COVID-19-positive women admitted.. · COVID-19 symptomatology did not appear to differ before or after the apex of infection in New York.. · Demographic risk factors are unlikely to capture a significant portion of COVID-19-positive patients..","Sutton, Desmond; Wen, Timothy; Staniczenko, Anna P; Huang, Yongmei; Andrikopoulou, Maria; D'Alton, Mary; Feinberg, Bruce B; Fuchs, Karin; Goffman, Dena; Gyamfi-Bannerman, Cynthia; Kahe, Ka; Landau, Ruth; Lasky, James A; Miller, Russell; Ntoso, Amma D; Panzer, Alexis; Sheen, Jean-Ju; Simpson, Lynn L; Friedman, Alexander M",American journal of perinatology,454,24

These patients commonly have associated diabetes and cardiovascular disease, with high rates of cardiovascular-related death. Management of ESKD requires renal replacement therapy via dialysis or transplantation. While transplantation provides the greatest improvement in survival and quality of life, the vast majority of patients are treated initially with hemodialysis. However, outcomes differ significantly among patient populations. Barriers in access to care have particularly affected at-risk populations, such as Black and Hispanic patients. These patients receive less pre-ESKD nephrology care, are less likely to initiate dialysis with a fistula, and wait longer for transplants-even in pediatric populations. Priorities for ESKD care moving into the future include increasing access to nephrology care in underprivileged populations, providing patient-centered care based on each patient's ""life plan,"" and focusing on team-based approaches to ESKD care.

We performed an international multicenter randomized trial comparing SFV versus standard single forward view examination of RC on adenoma detection. METHODS Asymptomatic individuals undergoing screening or surveillance colonoscopies from 6 Asia Pacific regions were invited for study. A forward view examination of RC was first performed in all patients, followed by randomization at hepatic flexure to either SFV examination of RC and standard withdrawal examination from hepatic flexure to rectum, or a standard withdrawal colonoscopy (SWC) examination from hepatic flexure to rectum. Primary outcome was RC ADR. RESULTS Between 2016 and 2019, 1011 patients were randomized (SFV group: 502, SWC group: 509). Forty-five endoscopists performed the colonoscopies. The RC ADR was significantly higher in the SFV group than the SWC group (27.1% vs 21.6%, p=0.042). The whole-colon ADR were high in both groups (49.0% vs 45.0%, p=0.201). SFV examination identified 58 additional adenomas in 49 patients (9.8%), leading to a change in surveillance recommendation in 15 patients (3.0%). The median overall withdrawal time was 1.5 minute longer in the SFV group (12.0 vs 10.5 minutes, p<0.001). Older age, male gender, ever smoking, and longer RC withdrawal time were independent predictors of right-sided adenoma detection. CONCLUSION In this multicenter trial, SFV examination significantly increased RC ADR in screening and surveillance colonoscopies. Routine RC SFV examination should be considered.

DESIGN Systematic review. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched for studies published from 1 January 1995 to 9 January 2020. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION Studies that developed a model to predict pulmonary TB treatment outcomes were included. Study screening, data extraction and quality assessment were conducted independently by two reviewers. Study quality was evaluated using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool. Data were synthesised with narrative review and in tables and figures. RESULTS 14 739 articles were identified, 536 underwent full-text review and 33 studies presenting 37 prediction models were included. Model outcomes included death (n=16, 43%), treatment failure (n=6, 16%), default (n=6, 16%) or a composite outcome (n=9, 25%). Most models (n=30, 81%) measured discrimination (median c-statistic=0.75; IQR: 0.68-0.84), and 17 (46%) reported calibration, often the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (n=13). Nineteen (51%) models were internally validated, and six (16%) were externally validated. Eighteen (54%) studies mentioned missing data, and of those, half (n=9) used complete case analysis. The most common predictors included age, sex, extrapulmonary TB, body mass index, chest X-ray results, previous TB and HIV. Risk of bias varied across studies, but all studies had high risk of bias in their analysis. CONCLUSIONS TB outcome prediction models are heterogeneous with disparate outcome definitions, predictors and methodology. We do not recommend applying any in clinical settings without external validation, and encourage future researchers adhere to guidelines for developing and reporting of prediction models.

We identified a diacylglycerol kinase ζ (DGKζ)-mediated pathway that regulated muscle mass during remodeling. During mechanical overload, DGKζ abundance was increased and required for effective hypertrophy. DGKζ not only augmented anabolic responses but also suppressed ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)-dependent proteolysis. We found that DGKζ inhibited the transcription factor FoxO that promotes the induction of the UPS. This function was mediated through a mechanism that was independent of kinase activity but dependent on the nuclear localization of DGKζ. During denervation, DGKζ abundance was also increased and was required for mitigating the activation of FoxO-UPS and the induction of atrophy. Conversely, overexpression of DGKζ prevented fasting-induced atrophy. Therefore, DGKζ is an inhibitor of the FoxO-UPS pathway, and interventions that increase its abundance could prevent muscle wasting.","You, Jae-Sung; Dooley, Matthew S; Kim, Chan-Ran; Kim, Eui-Jun; Xu, Wei; Goodman, Craig A; Hornberger, Troy A",Science signaling,454,31

Instead, a cystadenoma of the appendix was discovered during laparoscopy. METHODS A 64-year-old postmenopausal nulliparous woman was admitted to our hospital because of a cystic lesion, which had been detected in the course of a routine gynecological examination. The patient underwent vaginal ultrasound, magnetic resonance tomography, and laparoscopy. RESULTS During vaginal ultrasound, a dumbbell-shaped anechogenic cystic structure 70 x 32 x 22 mm in diameter was found in the region of the right adnexa. Magnetic resonance tomography revealed no additional information. During diagnostic laparoscopy, the cystic lesion was found to be a distended appendix. A laparoscopic appendectomy was performed. Subsequent histological analysis revealed a villous mucinous cystadenoma of the appendix with low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. CONCLUSION Gynecologists should routinely consider this disease in the differential diagnosis of right lower dumbbell abdominal cysts. Eleven percent to 20% of mucoceles are caused by mucinous cystadenocarcinomas, which carry the risk of peritoneal tumor implantation caused by rupture or laparoscopic resection. Therefore, it should be mandatory that a general surgeon be involved in the laparoscopic procedure and the conversion to laparotomy for resection of the structure.","Nouri, K; Demmel, M; Ott, J; Promberger, R; Huber, J C; Mayerhofer, K",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,454,16

These investments require a baseline metric that describes the burden of animal health and welfare in order to justify and prioritise resource allocation and from which to measure the impact of interventions. This paper is part of a process of scientific enquiry in which problems are identified and solutions sought in an inclusive way. It poses the broad question: what should a system to measure the animal disease burden on society look like and what value would it add? Moreover, it aims to do this in such a way as to be accessible by a wide audience, who are encouraged to engage in this debate. Given that farmed animals, including those raised by poor smallholders, are an economic entity, this system should be based on economic principles. These poor farmers are negatively impacted by disparities in animal health technology, which can be addressed through a mixture of supply-led and demand-driven interventions, reinforcing the relevance of targeted financial support from government and non-governmental organisations. The Global Burden of Animal Diseases (GBADs) Programme will glean existing data to measure animal health losses within carefully characterised production systems. Consistent and transparent attribution of animal health losses will enable meaningful comparisons of the animal disease burden to be made between diseases, production systems and countries, and will show how it is apportioned by people's socio-economic status and gender. The GBADs Programme will produce a cloud-based knowledge engine and data portal, through which users will access burden metrics and associated visualisations, support for decisionmaking in the form of future animal health scenarios, and the outputs of wider economic modelling. The vision of GBADs, strengthening the food system for the benefit of society and the environment, is an example of One Health thinking in action.","Bernardo, T M; Bruce, M; Rushton, J; Shaw, A P; Grace, D; Wieland, B; Herrero, M; Stone, M; Gilbert, W; Marsh, T L; Pendell, D; Huntington, B; Bondad-Reantaso, M; Devleesschauwer, B; Havelaar, A; Mesenhowski, S; Pigott, D; Stacey, D; Torgerson, P; Watkins, K",Revue scientifique et technique,454,16

Surgical procedures with the least possible impairment are consistently expected by both surgeons and patients. Here, we report a clinical cohort of 10 patients who underwent LSD with a new technique and present the advantages of less impairment during performance of this new technique. METHODS A cohort of 10 cirrhotic patients with bleeding portal hypertension and secondary hypersplenism treated with LSD were studied. During the procedure, an electromechanical morcellator allowed for easy extraction of the entire massive splenic tissue without a cumbersome intracorporeal bag, enlarged incision, or hand-assisted incision. Various perioperative data were recorded. RESULTS LSD was successful in all patients. There was no conversion to open operations or significant perioperative complications. The operative time was 288.0 ± 53.9 minutes, the spleen removal time was 39.3 ± 15.1 minutes, and blood loss was 240.0 ± 217.1 mL. CONCLUSIONS This new technique involving the use of an electromechanical morcellator provides expedient recovery and minimal postoperative pain and scarring. LSD with this technique is a feasible, effective, and safe surgical procedure, and embodies all the benefits of minimally invasive surgery for cirrhotic patients with bleeding portal hypertension and hypersplenism.","Jiang, Guoqing; Qian, Jianjun; Yao, Jie; Wang, Xiaodong; Jin, Shengjie; Bai, Dousheng",Surgical innovation,454,28

However, no paediatric data are available that shows the necessity of adding of pressure support during such tests. We sought to measure the WOBimp during an ERT with and without added pressure support and to study its clinical correlate. This was a prospective study in spontaneously breathing ventilated children < 18 years undergoing ERT. Using tracheal manometry, WOBimp was calculated by integrating the difference between positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and tracheal pressure (Ptrach) over the measured expiratory tidal volume (VTe) under two paired conditions: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with and without PS. Patients with post-extubation upper airway obstruction were excluded. RESULTS A total of 112 patients were studied. Median PS during the ERT was 10 cmH2O. WOBimp was significantly higher without PS (median 0.27, IQR 0.20-0.50 J/L) than with added PS (median 0.00, IQR 0.00-0.11 J/L). Although there were statistically significant changes in spontaneous breath rate [32 (23-42) vs. 37 (27-46) breaths/min, p < 0.001] and higher ET-CO2 [5.90 (5.38-6.65) vs. 6.23 (5.55-6.94) kPa, p < 0.001] and expiratory Vt decreased [7.72 (6.66-8.97) vs. 7.08 (5.82-8.08) mL/kg, p < 0.001] in the absence of PS, these changes appeared clinically irrelevant since the Comfort B score remained unaffected [12 (10-13) vs. 12 (10-13), P = 0.987]. Multivariable analysis showed that changes in WOBimp occurred independent of endotracheal tube size. CONCLUSIONS Withholding PS during ERT does not lead to clinically relevant increases in WOBimp, irrespective of endotracheal tube size.","van Dijk, Jefta; Blokpoel, Robert G T; Koopman, Alette A; Dijkstra, Sandra; Burgerhof, Johannes G M; Kneyber, Martin C J",Annals of intensive care,454,23

Tracheostomy insertion has often been delayed and the enduring effects of this on voice, swallow and airway outcomes in COVID-19 tracheostomy patients are unknown. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess these outcomes in this patient cohort following hospital discharge. METHODS All COVID-19 patients who had undergone tracheostomy insertion, and were subsequently decannulated, were identified at our institution and followed up two months post-discharge. Patient-reported (PROMS) and clinician-reported outcome measures, endoscopic examination and spirometry were used to assess voice, swallow and airway outcomes. RESULTS Forty-one patients were included in the study with a mean age of 56 years and male:female ratio of 28:13. Average duration of endotracheal intubation was 24 days and 63.4% of tracheostomies were performed at day 21-35 of intubation. 53.7% had an abnormal GRBAS score and 30% reported abnormal swallow on EAT-10 questionnaire. 81.1% had normal endoscopic examination of the larynx however positive endoscopic findings correlated with the patient self-reported VHI-10 (p=0.036) and EAT-10 scores (p=0.027). 22.5% had spirometric evidence of fixed upper airway obstruction using the Expiratory-Disproportion Index (EDI) and Spearman correlation analysis showed a positive trend between abnormal endoscopic findings and EDI scores over 50 (p<0.0001).

Increased Plk4 expression, which is a feature of many common human cancers, causes centriole overduplication, mitotic irregularities, and chromosomal instability. Plk4 can also promote cancer invasion and metastasis through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Herein we demonstrate physical interaction of Plk4 with FAM46C/TENT5C, a conserved protein of unknown function until recently. FAM46C localizes to centrioles, inhibits Plk4 kinase activity, and suppresses Plk4-induced centriole duplication. Interference with Plk4 function by FAM46C was independent of the latter's nucleotidyl transferase activity. In addition, FAM46C restrained cancer cell invasion and suppressed MDA MB-435 cancer growth in a xenograft model, opposing the effect of Plk4. We demonstrate loss of FAM46C in patient-derived colorectal cancer tumor tissue that becomes more profound with advanced clinical stage. These results implicate FAM46C as a tumor suppressor that acts by inhibiting Plk4 activity.","Kazazian, Karineh; Haffani, Yosr; Ng, Deanna; Lee, Chae Min Michelle; Johnston, Wendy; Kim, Minji; Xu, Roland; Pacholzyk, Karina; Zih, Francis Si-Wah; Tan, Julie; Smrke, Alannah; Pollett, Aaron; Wu, Hannah Sun-Tsi; Swallow, Carol Jane",Communications biology,454,26

BACKGROUND COVID-19 advanced rapidly and then spread worldwide. Pregnant women were more susceptible to the COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, it is not clear whether this infection will increase the risk of congenital monstrosity, foetal growth restriction, premature delivery or cause other long-term adverse effects. DESIGN A descriptive, cross-sectional survey. METHODS A total of 331 pregnant women participated in this study. And this research adhered to the STROBE guideline. The psychological questionnaire for emergent events of public health, pregnancy stress scale and security questionnaire were used to collect data. The hypothetical path model was tested using the SPSS version 25.0 software and AMOS version 26.0 software. RESULTS Fear and depression were the most common psychological responses among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hypothesis model of this study fitted the data well, and the results showed that psychological response positively affected pregnancy stress, while security sense negatively affected pregnancy stress; security sense mediated between psychological response and pregnancy stress. CONCLUSION Nurses and midwives can help reduce the stress in pregnant women by alleviating their psychological response to the COVID-19 pandemic and by improving their security sense. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE It is essential for the health staff to build trust with pregnant women and their families, and communicate accurate information to them. Nurses should promptly conduct a psychological response evaluation and psychological guidance for pregnant women to alleviate their fears and hypochondria related to COVID-19.","Zheng, Qing-Xiang; Jiang, Xiu-Min; Lin, Yan; Liu, Gui-Hua; Lin, Yu-Ping; Kang, Yu-Lan; Liu, Xiu-Wu",Journal of clinical nursing,454,33

METHODS A literature search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Excerpta Medica database, Psychological Information Database, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials) was conducted for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies up to 18 April 2021. The primary outcome was health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and main secondary outcome was neurological function with additional secondary outcomes being survival, rehospitalisation, safety (serious and non-serious adverse events), psychological well-being, fatigue, exercise capacity and physical capacity. Two authors independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. RESULTS Three RCTs and 11 observational studies were included (total 721 participants). Study duration ranged from 8 weeks to 2 years. Pooled data from two RCTs showed low-quality evidence for no effect on physical HRQoL (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.19, (95% CI: -0.09 to 0.47)) and no effect on mental HRQoL (SMD 0.27 (95% CI: -0.01 to 0.55)).Regarding secondary outcomes, very low-quality evidence was found for improvement in neurological function associated with inpatient rehabilitation for CA survivors with acquired brain injury (SMD 0.71, (95% CI: 0.45 to 0.96)) from five observational studies. Two small observational studies found exercise-based rehabilitation interventions to be safe for CA survivors, reporting no serious or non-serious events. CONCLUSIONS Given the overall low quality of evidence, this review cannot determine the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions for CA survivors on HRQoL, neurological function or other included outcomes, and recommend further high-quality studies be conducted. In the interim, existing clinical guidelines on rehabilitation provision after CA should be followed to meet the high burden of secondary consequences suffered by CA survivors.

To this end, we developed a detection algorithm and designed improvement for the RFID clip. METHODS To evaluate the proposed system, a swine-based animal study was conducted, followed by experiments on porcine stomachs and colons using the EASIE-R simulator. The success rates of endoscopic clipping, detection time, and detection accuracy, which is the distance between the detection point and RFID tag, were measured. RESULTS Results of the in vivo swine animal study showed success in all three clippings and detections of the RFID clips. Results of the 60 RFID endoclip attempts using the EASIE-R simulator showed a total clipping success rate of 85.0% (n = 51/60; stomach, 83.3%, n = 25/30; colon, 86.7%, n = 26/30). The median detection times were 29.2 s for the stomach and 25.5 s for the colon. The median detection accuracy was 4.0 mm for the stomach and 4.5 mm for the colon.

The installation of a food waste disposer (FWD) may increase the discharge of food waste (FW) into the wastewater; therefore, the installation of a FWD is discouraged in households that have a septic system. This study was conducted to determine how a typical dose of FW from a FWD can affect the performance of a septic system in terms of sewage treatment and solids accumulation. A 20-L control tank was compared with an experiment tank to which FW was added, increasing the amount of total suspended solids (TSS) by 31.3% and total chemical oxygen demands by 46.3% for a period of 110 days. Although the influent water quality changed dramatically, the effluent from the experiment tank had a substantially lower percentage increase in water quality parameters compared with the effluent from the control. It was found that in the experiment tank, 75.8% of FW TSS was degraded, whereas only 36.7% of sewage TSS was degraded, and that 18.8% of FW TSS and 44.9% of sewage TSS accumulated in the experiment tank. The addition of FW increased the scum accumulation, even though the dry matter of the scum layer was much less in quantity than the sludge layer. It also increased the lipid content in the sludge. The increase in the scum layer was mainly due to the increase in protein from the addition of the FW. Overall, compared with sewage TSS, FW TSS tends to be more biodegradable, which indicates that the impact on pumping frequency from adding FW will be insignificant.","Lin, Hongjian; Wang, Yuchuan; van Lierop, Leif; Zamalloa, Carlos; Furlong, Casey; Keleman, Michael; Hu, Bo","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",454,30

The US Food and Drug Administration, (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization for treatment with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Many people have a history of a significant allergic reaction to a specific food, medicine, or vaccine; hence, people all over the world have great concerns about these two authorized vaccines. This article compares the pharmacology, indications, contraindications, and adverse effects of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. MATERIALS AND METHODS The required documents and information were collected from the relevant databases, including Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), PubMed, EMBASE, World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Drug Authorities (FDA) USA, Local Ministries, Health Institutes, and Google Scholar. The key terms used were: Coronavirus, SARS-COV-2, COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines, Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, Moderna vaccine, pharmacology, benefits, allergic responses, indications, contraindications, and adverse effects. The descriptive information was recorded, and we eventually included 12 documents including research articles, clinical trials, and websites to record the required information. RESULTS Based on the currently available literature, both vaccines are beneficial to provide immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pfizer/BioNTech Vaccine has been recommended to people 16 years of age and older, with a dose of 30 μg (0.3 m) at a cost of $19.50. It provides immunogenicity for at least 119 days after the first vaccination and is 95% effective in preventing the SARS-COV-2 infection. However, Moderna Vaccine has been recommended to people 18 years of age and older, with a dose of 50 μg (0.5 mL) at a cost of $32-37. It provides immunogenicity for at least 119 days after the first vaccination and is 94.5% effective in preventing the SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, some associated allergic symptoms have been reported for both vaccines. The COVID-19 vaccines can cause mild adverse effects after the first or second doses, including pain, redness or swelling at the site of vaccine shot, fever, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, itching, chills, and joint pain, and can also rarely cause anaphylactic shock. The occurrence of adverse effects is reported to be lower in the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine compared to the Moderna vaccine; however, the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive. CONCLUSIONS The FDA has granted emergency use authorization for the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. These vaccines can protect recipients from a SARS-CoV- 2 infection by formation of antibodies and provide immunity against a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Both vaccines can cause various adverse effects, but these reactions are reported to be less frequent in the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine compared to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine; however, the Moderna vaccine compared to the Pfizer vaccine is easier to transport and store because it is less temperature sensitive.","Meo, S A; Bukhari, I A; Akram, J; Meo, A S; Klonoff, D C",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,454,24

METHODS Between January 2009 and October 2014, a total of 211 patients with known or suspected lung cancer donated their blood prior to surgery and were followed up to May 2018. ctDNA was extracted from plasma and from corresponding formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. The blood was analyzed in a blinded manner and pathology reports were issued that were blinded to the blood test results. The reference standard was histopathology confirmed cancer in the resected surgical specimens as reported according to World Health Organization criteria and staged using the eighth edition of the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors criteria. RESULTS Of 211 consenting patients, 19 (9.0%) were excluded, leaving 192 participants, consisting of 95 men (49%) and with a mean age of 63 years (SD, 15 years). The clinical test performance for the blood-based diagnostic signature demonstrated a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI, 67%-81%), specificity of 89% (95% CI, 70%-98%), positive predictive value of 98% (95% CI, 93%-100%), and negative predictive value of 35% (95% CI, 24%-48%) when compared with conventional clinical histopathology reporting of the resected tissue.

The goal of the study is to examine whether use of softer and longer coils gives an adequate VER with fewer coils, particularly for small aneurysms. METHODS Aneurysm volumes, VERs, and numbers of inserted coils were investigated in 23 cases of small aneurysms embolized using Infini coils, a long soft coil with a primary diameter of 0.010 inches (Infini group). An aneurysm volume- and VER-matched control (non-Infini) group of 59 cases was selected from patients treated at our facility. Data were also compared between subgroups of patients (n = 18 and n = 34 in the Infini and non-Infini groups, respectively) who were not treated with thicker coils with primary diameters of 0.0135-0.015 inches (18-type coils), since these coils affect the number of coils by increasing VER rapidly. RESULTS Average aneurysm volumes and VERs did not differ significantly between the Infini and non-Infini groups. Significantly fewer coils were used per 0.1 ml aneurysm volume in the Infini group (4.08 coils in average) compared with the non-Infini group (5.67) (p < 0.001). In the non-18-type subgroups, the number of coils used remained significantly smaller in the Infini group (4.49) compared with the non-Infini group (6.72), (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION To achieve VER ≥20%, use of Infini coils significantly decreased the number of coils required per unit volume of a small aneurysm.","Sadato, Akiyo; Hayakawa, Motoharu; Adachi, Kazuhide; Kato, Yoko; Hirose, Yuichi","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",454,1

But as food waste is still generated at high volumes, priority is placed on its proper management as a resource, maximising sustainability benefits. This study, by integrating a multi-criteria decision analysis with a sustainability assessment approach, develops a screening and decision support framework for comparing the sustainability performance of food waste management options. A structured process for selecting criteria based on the consideration of environmental, economic and social aspects related to region-specific food waste system planning, policy and management has been developed. Two food waste management options, namely the use of food waste disposal units, which grind food waste at the household's kitchen sink and discharge it to the sewer, and the anaerobic co-digestion of separately collected food waste with sewage sludge, were selected for comparison due to their potential to create synergies between local authorities, waste and water companies, with local circumstances determining which of the two options to adopt. A simplified process used for assessing and comparing the two food waste management options in the Anglian region in the UK, indicated that there are benefits in using the framework as a screening tool for identifying which option may be the most sustainable. To support decision-making, a detailed analysis that incorporates stakeholders' perspectives is required. An additional use of the framework can be in providing recommendations for optimising food waste management options in a specific region, maximising their sustainability performance.","Iacovidou, Eleni; Voulvoulis, Nikolaos",Environmental science and pollution research international,454,1

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of a newly developed device for endolumenal colon occlusion (ColoShield) in an acute porcine model. METHODS The principle of the ColoShield device is based on two balloons, with negative pressure in between. The ColoShield device and a gauze tamponade as a control group were evaluated in a non-survival study on 16 pigs. The efficacy of the occlusion system in establishing a leak-proof pneumorectum and in sealing the colon from proximal (watertight sealing) was tested by a standardized study course. Finally, the colon/rectum was explanted for macroscopic and microscopic examination. RESULTS A 20-mmHg leak-proof pneumorectum over a period of 10 min could be achieved in seven of eight (87 %) animals with the ColoShield device and in none of eight (0 %) animals with gauze tamponade (p < 0.001). In the watertight sealing test, mean intracolonic pressures of 23.5 ± 18.1 (0-53) mmHg using the ColoShield device and 0 ± 1.1 (0-3) mmHg using gauze tamponade (p = 0.003) were documented proximal to the occlusion system before a leakage occurred. Macroscopic and histopathological examinations revealed no significant impairment of the colon specimen in either group. CONCLUSIONS ColoShield proved to be a safe and effective device for a reversible endolumenal colon occlusion.

PURPOSE To test the effects of posture (seated and non-seated) and cadence (70 rpm and 120 rpm) on joint power contributions, effective mechanical advantage, and muscle activations within the leg during very-high-power output cycling. METHODS Fifteen male participants rode on an instrumented ergometer at 50% of their individualised instantaneous maximal power (10.74 ± 1.99 W⋅kg; above the reported threshold for seated to non-seated transition) in different postures (seated and non-seated) and at different cadences (70 rpm and 120 rpm); whilst leg muscle activity, full body motion capture, and crank radial and tangential forces were recorded. A scaled, full-body model was used to solve inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics to determine joint displacements and net joint moments. Statistical comparisons were made using repeated measure, two-way analyses of variance (posture x cadence). RESULTS There were significant main effects of posture and cadence on joint power contributions. A key finding was that the non-seated posture increased negative power at the knee, with an associated significant decrease of net power at the knee. The contribution of knee power decreased by 15% at both 70 and 120 rpm (~=0.8 W·kg) when non-seated compared to seated. Subsequently, hip power and ankle power contributions were significantly higher when non-seated compared to seated at both cadences. In both postures, knee power was 9% lower at 120 rpm compared to 70 rpm (~=0.4 W·kg). CONCLUSION These results evidenced that the contribution of knee joint power to leg power was reduced by switching from a seated to non-seated posture during very-high-power output cycling, however the size of the reduction is cadence dependent.","Wilkinson, Ross D; Lichtwark, Glen A; Cresswell, Andrew G",Medicine and science in sports and exercise,454,1

Exacerbations bear clinical and prognostic relevance, and may result in marked functional and clinical deterioration. The varying presentations of COPD mean that exacerbations, although more frequent in patients with severe or very severe disease, may occur regardless of the degree of functional impairment. The new Spanish COPD Guideline (GesEPOC) has provided new insights into the management of the disease. The GesEPOC defines various disease phenotypes with different clinical, prognostic and therapeutic implications. One of these phenotypes is the so-called 'exacerbator', characterized by the incidence of an increased number of exacerbations (two or more moderate-severe exacerbations in the last year). An exacerbation must be defined by: an increase in symptom intensity occurring after a certain period of time since the last exacerbation (so that treatment failure can be excluded as the cause of the event); and the contribution of social criteria or reasons concerning the choice of therapy. The availability of certain tools to detect exacerbations would enable establishment of a homogeneous definition of exacerbation, and improved diagnosis, a suitable treatment choice and a more appropriate patient selection for clinical studies. Validated clinical questionnaires and biomarkers are the most helpful instruments to reach the above objectives. Following the clinical diagnosis of a COPD exacerbation, associated comorbidities must be evaluated and an etiologic diagnosis must be made, all of which will partially drive the choice of treatment. Once a diagnosis has been made, the severity of the exacerbation should be established in order to define where and how the patient should be treated. Based on the patient's clinical history, clinical examination and diagnostic tests, the severity will be classified in one of these four degrees: very severe, severe, moderate and mild.","Trigueros Carrero, Juan Antonio",Expert review of respiratory medicine,454,24

METHODS Patients with complex cerebral arteriovenous malformations seen in our neurosurgery department from January 2016 to December 2017 were prospectively enrolled. The hybrid surgery protocol included ""angiographic diagnosis, surgical resection, and intraoperative angiographic evaluation"" and ""angiographic diagnosis and embolization, surgical resection, and intraoperative angiographic evaluation"". The patients were randomly stratified into intensive care group and routine care group. After surgery, intensive or routine care was provided, and the prognosis of patients was evaluated, with a subsequent comparative analysis. RESULTS A total of 109 cases were divided into the routine nursing group (n = 54 cases) and intensive nursing group (n = 55 cases). There were no significant differences between the two groups in baseline data before surgery. Postoperative lung infection in the intensive nursing group was significantly less frequent than those in the routine nursing group (5.5% vs. 18.5%, P=0.039) with pulmonary infection and lower extremity venous thrombosis (5.5% vs. 24.1%, P=0.006). The average hospital stay in the intensive nursing group was 14.4 ± 5.78 days, which was significantly lower than that in the routine nursing group (19.3 ± 6.38 days, P=0.013). At 3 months' follow-up after surgery, the Generic Quality of Life Inventory-74 (GQOLI-74) dimension score and GQOLI-74 total score in the enhanced group were significantly better than those in the routine nursing group (P=0.017 and 0.023, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Intensive postoperative nursing can improve the safety of patients after hybrid surgery, reduce the postoperative complications and the average length of hospital stay, and improve the quality of life of patients.","Zhao, Dong-Hong; Xue, Rui; Sun, Xiao-Rong",Chinese neurosurgical journal,454,1

METHODS Detailed family history and clinical data of six Chinese families with autosomal dominant congenital cataracts were recorded. Targeted exome sequencing was applied to detect the underlying genetic defects for the families. Generated variants were confirmed by PCR and sanger sequencing. Afterward, bioinformatic analysis through several computational predictive programs was performed to assess impacts of mutations on protein structure and function. RESULTS A total of 53 participants (23 affected and 30 unaffected) from six unrelated Chinese families were recruited. Cataract phenotypes covered nuclear, total, posterior polar, pulverulent, snowflake-like, and zonular. Through targeted exome sequencing, six mutations in four β-crystallin genes were revealed which included five missense mutations CRYBB1 p.Q70P, CRYBB2 p.E23Q, CRYBB2 p.A49V, CRYBB2 R188C, CRYBA4 p.M14K and one splice mutation CRYBB3 c.75+1 G>A. In silico results predicted pathogenic for all four missense variants except variant CRYBB2-p.A49V yielded results as tolerant. The CRYBB3 c.75+1 G>A splice site mutation was predicted to be deleterious by leading to a broken splice site, a premature stop codon, and subsequently resulting in a short peptide of 113 amino acids, which may affect protein features. CONCLUSION The obtained results expanded mutational and phenotype spectrum of β-crystallin genes and offer clues for pathogenesis of congenital cataracts. The data also demonstrated that targeted exome sequencing is valuable for providing molecular diagnostic information for congenital cataract patients.","Yu, Yinhui; Qiao, Yue; Ye, Yang; Li, Jinyu; Yao, Ke",Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,454,16

Anasarca is a rare manifestation of this disease and is associated with a more severe and refractory course, requiring increased immunosuppression. Early recognition of this atypical presentation of JDM may lead to earlier treatment and better outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION We present two female patients, ages 11 years old and 4 years old, who presented to the ED with anasarca and were subsequently diagnosed with JDM. Both patients required ICU-level care and significant immunosuppression, including prolonged courses of IV methylprednisolone, IVIG, and Rituximab. CONCLUSIONS Anasarca is a rare presentation of Juvenile Dermatomyositis, but it is important for clinicians to recognize this manifestation of the disease. Early recognition and treatment will lead to better outcomes in these children and hopefully decrease the need for prolonged hospitalization and ICU level care.","Schildt, Emily E; De Ranieri, Deirdre",Pediatric rheumatology online journal,454,1

METHODS Retrospective cohort study (RETRACE) of 22 participating centres and prospective single-centre study with 1702 patients with VKA-associated or NOAC-associated ICH and 1022 patients with non-OAC-ICH with heparin prophylaxis between 2006 and 2015. Outcomes were defined as rates of IHC during hospital stay among patients with non-OAC-ICH, VKA-ICH and NOAC-ICH, mortality and functional outcome at 3 months between patients with ICH with and without IHC. RESULTS IHC occurred in 1.7% (42/2416) of patients with ICH. There were no differences in crude incidence rates among patients with VKA-ICH, NOAC-ICH and non-OAC-ICH (log-rank p=0.645; VKA-ICH: 27/1406 (1.9%), NOAC-ICH 1/130 (0.8%), non-OAC-ICH 14/880 (1.6%); p=0.577). Detailed analysis according to treatment exposure (days with and without LDSH) revealed no differences in incidence rates of IHC per 1000 patient-days (LDSH: 1.43 (1.04-1.93) vs non-LDSH: 1.32 (0.33-3.58), conditional maximum likelihood incidence rate ratio: 1.09 (0.38-4.43); p=0.953). Secondary outcomes showed differences in functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale=4-6: IHC: 29/37 (78.4%) vs non-IHC: 1213/2048 (59.2%); p=0.019) and mortality (IHC: 14/37 (37.8%) vs non-IHC: 485/2048 (23.7%); p=0.045) in disfavour of patients with IHC. Small ICH volume (OR: volume <4.4 mL: 0.18 (0.04-0.78); p=0.022) and low National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission (OR: NIHSS <4: 0.29 (0.11-0.78); p=0.014) were significantly associated with fewer IHC. CONCLUSIONS Heparin administration for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in patients with ICH appears to be safe regarding IHC among non-OAC-ICH, VKA-ICH and NOAC-ICH in this observational cohort analysis. Randomised controlled trials are needed to verify the safety and efficacy of heparin compared with other methods for VTE prevention.","Sprügel, Maximilian I; Sembill, Jochen A; Kuramatsu, Joji B; Gerner, Stefan T; Hagen, Manuel; Roeder, Sebastian S; Endres, Matthias; Haeusler, Karl Georg; Sobesky, Jan; Schurig, Johannes; Zweynert, Sarah; Bauer, Miriam; Vajkoczy, Peter; Ringleb, Peter Arthur; Purrucker, Jan Christoph; Rizos, Timolaos; Volkmann, Jens; Muellges, Wolfgang; Kraft, Peter; Schubert, Anna-Lena; Erbguth, Frank; Nueckel, Martin; Schellinger, Peter D; Glahn, Jörg; Knappe, Ulrich J; Fink, Gereon Rudolf; Dohmen, Christian; Stetefeld, Henning; Fisse, Anna Lena; Minnerup, Jens; Hagemann, Georg; Rakers, Florian; Reichmann, Heinz; Schneider, Hauke; Wöpking, Sigrid; Ludolph, Albert C; Stösser, Sebastian; Neugebauer, Hermann; Röther, Joachim; Michels, Peter; Schwarz, Michael; Reimann, Gernot; Bäzner, Hansjörg; Schwert, Henning; Classen, Joseph; Michalski, Dominik; Grau, Armin; Palm, Frederick; Urbanek, Christian; Wöhrle, Johannes C; Alshammari, Fahid; Horn, Markus; Bahner, Dirk; Witte, Otto W; Guenther, Albrecht; Hamann, Gerhard F; Lücking, Hannes; Dörfler, Arnd; Schwab, Stefan; Huttner, Hagen B","Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry",454,1

Eligible individuals had a family history of PDAC and a relative with a germline pathogenic variant in APC, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDKN2A, EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PALB2, PMS2, STK11, or TP53 genes. Participants were recruited at six academic cancer centers and through social media campaigns and patient advocacy efforts. Enrollment occurred via the study website (https://GENERATEstudy.org) and all participation, including collecting a saliva sample for genetic testing, could be done from home. Participants were randomized to one of two remote methods that delivered genetic education about the risks of inherited PDAC and strategies for surveillance. The primary outcome of the study was uptake of genetic testing. From 5/8/2019 to 5/6/2020, 49 participants were randomized to each of the intervention arms. Overall, 90 of 98 (92%) of randomized participants completed genetic testing. The most frequently detected pathogenic variants included those in BRCA2 (N = 15, 17%), ATM (N = 11, 12%), and CDKN2A (N = 4, 4%). Participation in the study remained steady throughout the onset of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Preliminary data from the GENERATE study indicate success of remote alternatives to traditional cascade testing, with genetic testing rates over 90% and a high rate of identification of germline pathogenic variant carriers who would be ideal candidates for PDAC interception approaches.

The cytokine storm in SARS-CoV2 infection has been linked with both diabetes and Vitamin D deficiency. This study examined the hypothesis that supplementation with vitamin D, in combination with l-cysteine (LC), is better at reducing oxidative stress and thereby, more effective, at inhibiting the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in U937 monocytes exposed to high glucose concentrations. Methods: U937 monocytes were pretreated with 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D (VD, 10 nM) or LC (250 µM) or VD + LC for 24 h and then exposed to control or high glucose (HG, 25 mM) for another 24 h. Results: There were significantly greater reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in monocytes treated with HG than those in controls. Combined supplementation with VD and LC showed a more significant reduction in ROS (46%) in comparison with treatment with LC (19%) or VD (26%) alone in monocytes exposed to HG. Similarly, VD supplementation, together with LC, caused a more significant inhibition in the secretion of IL-8 (36% versus 16%) and MCP-1 (46% versus 26%) in comparison with that of VD (10 nM) alone in high-glucose treated monocytes. Conclusions: These results suggest that combined supplementation with vitamin D and LC has the potential to be more effective than either VD or LC alone in lowering the risk of oxidative stress and inflammation associated with type 2 diabetes or COVID-19 infection. Further, this combined vitamin D with LC/N-acetylcysteine may be a potent alternative therapy for SARS-CoV2 infected subjects. This approach can prevent cellular damage due to cytokine storm in comorbid systemic inflammatory conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension.","Jain, Sushil K; Micinski, David; Parsanathan, Rajesh",Journal of the American College of Nutrition,454,10

This has resulted in an urgent need to obtain information regarding its pathogenesis, diagnosis and clinical manifestations. More specifically, skin manifestations, seldom reported initially, have been increasingly described. MATERIAL AND METHODS We performed a literature search in the PubMed database, regarding cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19. This article describes the clinical and histological findings of the main skin lesions observed in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. DISCUSSION Cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 have been described in multiple retrospective and prospective studies, case series and case reports. The reported incidence reached 20.4%. Although there was substantial heterogeneity in terms of clinical patterns, the main ones include: erythematous/maculopapular, urticarial, papulovesicular, and purpuric/petechial eruptions, chilblain-like lesions and livedoid/acro-ischemic lesions. In the vast majority, the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are not fully understood, although histopathological findings and biomolecular studies can add relevant data. CONCLUSION The recognition of cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19 is of utmost importance. They may help establishing an early diagnosis, namely in oligosymptomatic patients or when confirmatory tests are impossible to perform. Moreover, chilblain-like lesions and acro-ischemia, also seem to play an important role in terms of prognosis.","Relvas, Maria; Calvão, Joana; Oliveira, Raquel; Cardoso, José Carlos; Gonçalo, Margarida",Acta medica portuguesa,454,1

In experimental animals, IL-1 treatments cause hypotension due to rapid reduction of systemic blood pressure, reduced vascular resistance, increased heart rate and leukocyte aggregations. IL-1 causes endothelial dysfunction, the triggering factor of which may be of a different nature including pathogen infection. This dysfunction, which includes macrophage intervention and increased protein permeability, can be mediated by several factors including cytokines and arachidonic acid products. These effects are caused by the induction of IL-1 in various pathologies, including those caused by pathogenic viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2 which provokes COVID-19. Activation of macrophages by coronavirus-19 leads to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, metalloproteinases and other proteolytic enzymes that can cause thrombi formation and severe respiratory dysfunction. Patients with COVID-19, seriously ill and hospitalized in intensive care, present systemic inflammation, intravascular coagulopathy with high risk of thrombotic complications, and venous thromboembolism, effects mostly mediated by IL-1. In these patients the lungs are the most critical target organ as it can present an increase in the degradation products of fibrin, fibrinogen and D-dimer, with organ lesions and respiratory failure. It is well known that IL-1 induces itself and another very important pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF, which also participates in hemodynamic states, including shock syndrome in COVID-19. Both IL-1 and TNF cause pulmonary edema, thrombosis and bleeding. In addition to hypotension and resistance of systemic blood pressure, IL-1 causes leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. The formation of thrombi is the main complication of the circulatory system and functionality of the organ, and represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality. IL-1 causes platelet vascular thrombogenicity also on non-endothelial cells by stimulating the formation of thromboxane A2 which is released into the inflamed environment. IL-1 is the most important immune molecule in inducing fever, since it is involved in the metabolism of arachidonic acid which increases from vascular endothelial organs of the hypothalamus. The pathogenesis of thrombosis, vascular inflammation and angigenesis involves the mediation of the activation of the prostanoid thromboxane A2 receptor. In 1986, in an interesting article (Conti P, Reale M, Fiore S, Cancelli A, Angeletti PU, Dinarello CA. In vitro enhanced thromboxane B2 release by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages after treatment with human recombinant interleukin 1. Prostaglandins. 1986 Jul;32(1):111-5), we reported for the first time that IL-1 induces thromboxane B2 (TxB2) releases in activated neutrophils and macrophages. An increase in thromboxane can induce leukocyte aggregation and systemic inflammation, which would account for the dramatic thrombi formation and organ dysfunction. Hence, IL-1 stimulates endothelial cell-leukocyte adhesion, and TxB2 production. All these events are supported by the large increase in neutrophils that adhere to the lung and the decrease in lymphocytes. Therefore, ecosanoids such as TxA2 (detected as TxB2) have a powerful action on vascular inflammation and platelet aggregation, mediating the formation of thrombi. The thrombogenesis that occurs in COVID-19 includes platelet and cell aggregation with clotting abnormalities, and anti-clotting inhibitor agents are used in the prevention and therapy of thrombotic diseases. Prevention of or induction of TxA2 avoids thrombi formation induced by IL-1. However, in some serious vascular events where TxA2 increases significantly, it is difficult to inhibit, therefore, it would be much better to prevent its induction and generation by blocking its inductors including IL-1. The inhibition or lack of formation of IL-1 avoids all the above pathological events which can lead to death of the patient. The treatment of innate immune cells producing IL-1 with IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) can avoid hemodynamic changes, septic shock and organ inflammation by carrying out a new therapeutic efficacy on COVID-19 induced by SARS-CoV-2.","Conti, P; Caraffa, Al; Gallenga, C E; Ross, R; Kritas, S K; Frydas, I; Younes, A; Di Emidio, P; Ronconi, G; Toniato, E",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,454,17

We aimed to elucidate risk associations of IVH and outcome in the Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2) data set. METHODS INTERACT2 was an international prospective, open-blinded end point, randomized controlled trial in 2839 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (<6 hours) with elevated systolic blood pressure randomly assigned to intensive (target systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg) or guideline-based (systolic blood pressure <180 mm Hg) blood pressure management. Associations of baseline IVH in 740 of 2613 (28%) patients and poor outcomes (death and major disability defined on the modified Rankin Scale) at 90 days were determined in linear and logistic regression models. RESULTS Patients with IVH were significantly older and with greater neurological impairment, history of ischemic stroke, and larger hematomas more often deep hemisphere located at presentation, after adjustment for other baseline variables. Death or major disability occurred in 66% with IVH versus 49% in intracerebral hemorrhage-alone patients (adjusted odds ratio, 1.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-2.06; P<0.01). Associations of IVH volume and clinical outcomes were strong and near continuous. Adjusted analyses by thirds of IVH volume indicate thresholds of ≈5 and 10 mL for significantly increased odds of death and death or major disability, respectively. CONCLUSIONS A strong association exists between the amount of IVH and poor outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage. An IVH volume of 5 to 10 mL emerges as a significant threshold for decision making on prognosis in these patients. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Various devices have been used, but the two most common approaches are aspiration thrombectomy and stent-retrieval thrombectomy. Aspiration thrombectomy has advanced from the traditional Penumbra system to forced arterial suction thrombectomy and a direct aspiration first-pass technique. Newer generation aspiration catheters with flexible distal tips and a larger bore have demonstrated faster and better recanalization relative to older devices. Recently, several species of distal access catheters have similar structural characteristics to the Penumbra reperfusion catheter. Therefore, we used the distal access catheter for forced arterial suction thrombectomy in three patients with acute ischemic stroke. In each case, we achieved fast and complete recanalization without significant complications. Forced arterial suction thrombectomy using a distal access catheter might provide another option for mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke.","Lee, Ho-Cheol; Kang, Dong-Hun; Hwang, Yang-Ha; Kim, Yong-Sun; Kim, Yong-Won",Neurointervention,454,19

This study aims to identify and prioritize variables important to patients when making the decision to start HCV treatment. METHODS A three-round Delphi process was conducted with the first round derived from a systematic literature review and advisory board input, including patients who have been affected by HCV, physicians, pharmacists, and a patient group representative. Delphi panelists were HCV patients who had received treatment or were considering treatment. Panelists were asked about factors influencing their HCV treatment decisions. Thematic analysis of open-ended responses based on grounded theory was used. Agreement with each category and rankings based on order of importance from the patient perspective was reported. RESULTS Treatment effectiveness (100% agreement), longer life (88%), fear of complications (84%), financial issues (80%), quality of life (100%), and impact on society (80%) were considered important factors to patients in decisions to seek treatment. A fear of harming others (87%) was considered more important than physical symptoms (83%) in terms of patient-reported problems caused by HCV. Medication costs (91%) were identified as the most important costs of having HCV, followed by doctor costs (77%). CONCLUSIONS In addition to treatment effectiveness, patient experiences with financial problems, quality of life, and altruistic desires impact HCV patients' decisions. The risk of infecting others may motivate patients to seek treatment as much as personally experienced physical symptoms.","Mattingly, T Joseph; Slejko, Julia F; Perfetto, Eleanor M; Kottilil, Shyamasundaran; Mullins, C Daniel",The patient,454,29

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the results obtained with video-assisted surgery (VATS) in benign disease are comparable to those obtained in oncologic surgery, where VATS has been validated. METHODS We have reviewed the files of 246 consecutive patients who underwent VATS lobectomy from January 2012 to August 2015. The cohort was divided into two groups according to pathology (benign or malignant). Outcome parameters on scrutiny were demographics, pathology, duration of air leak, drainage and hospital stay, conversion, and perioperative complication rate. Comparisons were made with the χ 2 test and Student's t test; any p value ≤0.05 was considered as significant. RESULTS Group 1 (36 patients) included patients who underwent lobectomy for benign disease and group 2 (210 patients) patients affected by lung cancer or pulmonary metastases. The two groups differed with reference to age (p < 0.001), history of cancer (p < 0.001), history of stroke (p = 0.05), and the presence of pleural adhesions (p = 0.03). There was no difference for duration of air leaks, chest tube drainage and hospital stay, conversion rate, and perioperative complication rate. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that pathology did not impact on outcomes after VATS lobectomy. This study suggests that VATS is as a safe option in selected patients with benign disease requiring lobectomy, despite a more complex technical context.","Mazzella, Antonio; Olland, Anne; Garelli, Elena; Renaud, Stephane; Reeb, Jeremie; Santelmo, Nicola; Falcoz, Pierre Emmanuel; Massard, Gilbert",Surgical endoscopy,454,1

PRRS virus (PRRSV) interacts primarily with lung macrophages. Little is known how the virus subverts the innate immune response to initiate its replication in alveolar macrophages. Large-scale transcriptional responses of macrophages with different levels of susceptibility to PRRSV infection were compared over 30 h of infection. This study demonstrates a rapid and intense host transcriptional remodelling during the early phase of the replication of the virus which correlates with transient repression of type-I interferon transcript as early as 8 h post-infection. These results support the suggestion from previous studies that host innate immune response inhibits replication of European porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in macrophages by altering differential regulation of type-I interferon transcriptional response.,"Ait-Ali, Tahar; Wilson, Alison D; Carré, Wilfrid; Westcott, David G; Frossard, Jean-Pierre; Mellencamp, Marnie A; Mouzaki, Daphne; Matika, Oswald; Waddington, David; Drew, Trevor W; Bishop, Stephen C; Archibald, Alan L",Immunogenetics,454,19

Visual judgment of lesion conspicuity on FLAIR is however methodically limited by moderate inter-rater agreement. We therefore sought to improve rating homogeneity by incorporating quantitative signal intensity measurements. METHODS One hundred forty-three data sets of patients with acute ischemic stroke were visually rated by 8 raters with respect to WAKE-UP study inclusion and exclusion criteria, and inter-rater agreement was calculated. A subanalysis was performed on 45 cases to determine a threshold value of relative signal intensity (rSI) between the ischemic lesion and contralateral healthy tissue which best corresponded to a visually established verdict of FLAIR positivity. The usefulness of this threshold in improving inter-rater agreement was evaluated in an additional sample of 50 patients. RESULTS Inter-rater agreement for inclusion into the WAKE-UP trial was 73% with a free-marginal κ of 0.46. A threshold of rSI which best correlated with the visual rating of lesions as FLAIR positive was 1.20. The addition of rSI measurements to visual evaluation did not change the inter-rater agreement. CONCLUSIONS Introducing a semiquantitative measure for FLAIR rSI did not improve the agreement between individual raters. However, enhancing visual assessment with rSI measurements can provide reassurance to local investigators in cases of uncertainty.","Galinovic, Ivana; Puig, Josep; Neeb, Lars; Guibernau, Jorge; Kemmling, Andre; Siemonsen, Susanne; Pedraza, Salvador; Cheng, Bastian; Thomalla, Götz; Fiehler, Jens; Fiebach, Jochen B",Stroke,454,31

However, some argue that HPV vaccine recipients may engage in risky compensatory sexual behaviours because of perceived protection afforded by the vaccine. Therefore, we investigated the impact of a wide-scale HPV vaccination programme on sexual behaviours among adolescent women in Rwanda-the first African country to implement a national HPV vaccination. We identified a cohort of women who were eligible for the HPV vaccination and those who were not eligible from the most recent Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey. We used a quasi-experimental regression discontinuity design, exploiting the quasi-random change in HPV vaccination eligibility in 2011, to compare sexual behaviours among vaccinated and unvaccinated adolescent women. We studied the impact of the vaccination on reported sexual intercourse, average number of sexual partners and teenage pregnancy across the vaccination eligibility threshold. Our analysis included 3052 adolescent women (mean age: 18.6 years), of whom 58% were eligible for HPV vaccination. Nearly one in five adolescents reported having had sexual intercourse (18.5%). The average reported lifetime number of sexual partners was 1.41. The proportion of teenage pregnancy was 5.3%. We found no evidence that HPV vaccination was associated with any significant changes across the eligibility threshold in reported sexual behaviours we studied: no significant increase in the proportion of having sexual intercourse [odds ratio (OR): 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.57-1.12; P = 0.19], in lifetime number of sexual partners (rate ratio 0.99, 95% CI: 0.83-1.17, P = 0.91) and in the proportion of teen pregnancies (OR 1.05, 95% CI: 0.50 to 2.20, P = 0.89) at the eligibility threshold.

Here we show that the histone methyltransferase DOT1L, which marks the nucleosome core on active genes, safeguards normal differentiation of CD8+ T cells. T-cell specific ablation of Dot1L resulted in loss of naïve CD8+ T cells and premature differentiation towards a memory-like state, independent of antigen exposure and in a cell-intrinsic manner. Without DOT1L, the memory-like CD8+ cells fail to acquire full effector functions in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, DOT1L controlled T-cell differentiation and function by ensuring normal T-cell receptor density and signaling, and by maintaining epigenetic identity, in part by indirectly supporting the repression of developmentally-regulated genes.

This study considers the restrictive approaches taken by Her Majesty's Prison Service during this challenging time, to argue that prisoner education is not being adequately prioritised. This study highlight issues relating to the digital divide in prisons and the lack of technological advancement, which could improve educational continuity and in-cell learning. Design/methodology/approach This study provides an examination of the broad impact the national pandemic has had on prisons and punishment, Covid-19 National Frameworks and policies relating to prison restrictions, the movements within prisoner education policy, scholarship and reflections from delivering Learning Together in HMP Full Sutton, to argue that prisoners are at the bottom of the educational hierarchy in terms of delivery, innovation and prioritisation of learner needs. However, this study proposes that some of the technologically enhanced learning is a potential solution, to transform educational equity and to reduce the digital divide. Findings This study highlights that education in prisons has taken a sudden and substantial deterioration. Findings suggest that there are few signs of this improving in the immediate future due to ongoing national restrictions. The Covid-19 prison restrictions further demonstrate the neglect of prisoners' educational needs. In addition, the national pandemic has highlighted the lack of use of technology within educational delivery in prisoners. However, findings suggest that through engaging digital learning platforms and the greater inclusions of technology in prisons, they can enhance educational opportunities and inclusive experiences for isolated learners. Research limitations/implications This is a study piece with support from a review of policy and scholarship. This is not based on data collected with serving prisoners during the national pandemic. Originality/value This study provides an overview of the current restrictions and lockdowns in prison associated with the national pandemic. Contemporary consideration to this underexplored area is essential to highlight the severe deprivations of prisoners and the fundamental impact this has had on educational delivery and much anticipated progression.

Although mass disasters with similar traumatic effects are not exceptional incidents globally, the rate of the spread of infection, the scale of the effects of the disease and precautions, and uncertainty concerning the nature, prevention from, and treatment of the disease render the psychosocial effects unique. As it is the case for the individual’s response to the stressful events, the psychiatric communities initially addressed this challenge by adapting their usual responses to mass trauma, through their capacity acquired from earlier experiences and training. Although the response to the pandemic is expected to be orchestrated by the public authorities, in many countries, either the administration was not sufficiently cognizant of the psychosocial consequences of the pandemic, or the health-care system was unable to function properly due to the excessive burden. Therefore, the associations of mental health professionals, with varying degrees of preparedness to cope with such a challenge, had to recruit their full resources. As many associations worldwide did, the Psychiatric Association of Turkey prepared written and audiovisual resources for psychiatrists, health professionals, and the general population related to the mental health effects of the pandemic and precautions, often including strategies to cope with stress-related difficulties. Many associations, also provided distant-access psychological support to health-care workers on the frontlines and the general population.

A key challenge in climate policy is how to value health impacts, which are likely to be large and varied, considering that they will accrue over long time horizons (centuries), will occur throughout the world, and will be distributed unevenly within countries depending in part on socioeconomic status. These features raise a number of important economic and ethical issues including how to value human life in different countries at different levels of development, how to value future people, and how much priority to give the poor and disadvantaged. In this article we review each of these issues, describe different approaches for addressing them in quantitative climate policy analysis, and show how their treatment can dramatically change what should be done about climate change. Finally, we use the social cost of carbon, which reflects the cost of adding carbon emissions to the atmosphere, as an example of how analysis of climate impacts is sensitive to ethical assumptions. We consider $20 a reasonable lower bound for the social cost of carbon, but we show that a much higher value is warranted given a strong concern for equity within and across generations.","Scovronick, Noah; Ferranna, Maddalena; Dennig, Francis; Budolfson, Mark",Health affairs,454,9

All asthmatics underwent symptom score assessment.GMCSF concentrations in sputum and RSV-IgM/IgG in serum samples were measured for all participants by Enzyme Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA). RESULTS The GM-CSF concentration level was significantly higher in asthmatics (270.27± 194.87pg/mL) especially among moderate and severe disease with mean concentration of 197.33±98.47 and 521.08± 310.04 respectively, compared to healthy controls (22.20±21.27 pg/ mL) (p =0.0001). The sputum level of GM-CSF in asthmatics is highly significant associated with positive anti-RSV IgG sera which represents 35/45(77.8%) with mean GM-CSF concentration of (276.99± 86.42) compared with controls at about 31/45 (68.9%) with GM-CSF mean concentration of (22.84±23.47). On the other hand, positive anti-RSV IgM in asthma cases was 8 out of 45(17.8 %) with GM-CSF mean concentration of (307.25± 306.65). Furthermore, GM-CSF sputum level was significantly correlated with eosinophil count especially in moderate and severe asthma. CONCLUSIONS This study revealed that GM-CSF level is associated with eosinophilia and indicates asthma severity that might be evident during RSV infection .The distinctive GM-CSF features observed in the sputum from asthmatics with RSV may be useful as a diagnostic methods to help match patients with antibody therapy.","Abdullah, S F",The Medical journal of Malaysia,454,1

AIM To evaluate whether a 1-w acid suppression trial is effective for predicting 8-w response in such patients. METHODS Helicobacter pylori-negative patients (aged 18-50 years) in primary care with uninvestigated epigastric pain or burning were randomized to esomeprazole 40 mg q.d.s. or b.d. for 1w, followed by esomeprazole 40 mg q.d.s. or placebo for 7w. Each day, patients rated the severity of their symptoms. RESULTS Based on the last 3d, 1-w response rates were 39% (231 of 588) and 43% (258 of 596) with esomeprazole 40 mg q.d.s. and b.d., respectively. Based on the last 7d, response rates at 4w were 38% (283 of 738) and 25% (93 of 380) for esomeprazole and placebo, respectively, and 47% (339 of 716) and 34% (124 of 368), respectively, at 8w (both P < 0.001 vs. placebo). The sensitivity and specificity of esomeprazole treatment were 58% and 70%, respectively, at 8w. CONCLUSION A 1-w acid suppression trial is of limited clinical value for predicting 8-w response in patients with symptoms of epigastric pain or burning. Esomeprazole provides greater symptom control than placebo at 4w and 8w.","van Zanten, S V; Flook, N; Talley, N J; Vakil, N; Lauritsen, K; Bolling-Sternevald, E; Persson, T; Björck, E; Svedberg, L-E",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,454,8

METHODS AND RESULTS Eighteen patients with DAD were studied, in whom hyaline membranes were present in one or more out of five sections from each lobe of the lungs and 15 patients with no DAD. Light microscopy revealed hyaline membrane in over 25% of lobes from 18 patients with DAD. The cytoplasm of pneumocytes from six of 18 cases of DAD contained IB. Immunohistochemically, all IBs were characteristically positive for both ubiquitin (Ub) and cytokeratin KL-1. Cytoplasmic granules were also Ub+ in four cases of DAD without IB. IB+ or Ub+ pneumocytes were undetectable in non-DAD patients. We evaluated DAD severity based on hyaline membrane formation; the mean score in DAD with IB (3.60; n = 6) was significantly higher than that in Ub- (2.92; n = 8). Ub+ pneumocytes were found with or without IB among those cases with high DAD scores. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that disordered proteolysis in the Ub-mediated proteasome system leads to the accumulation of abnormal ubiquitinated protein, which includes cytokeratin, in pneumocytes. This is the first report to suggest that Ub+ pneumocytes are associated with disease severity in patients with DAD.","Yamada, T; Uehara, K; Kawanishi, R; Mizutani, T; Sunagawa, K; Araya, J; Kawabata, Y",Histopathology,454,33

As many in-person mental health support services have been suspended or transitioned online to facilitate physical distancing, there have been numerous calls for the rapid expansion of asynchronous virtual mental health (AVMH) resources. These AVMH resources have great potential to provide support for people coping with negative mental health impacts associated with the pandemic; however, literature examining use prior to COVID-19 illustrates that the uptake of these resources is consistently low. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to examine the use of AVMH resources in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population and among a participant subgroup classified as experiencing an adverse mental health impact related to the pandemic. METHODS: Data from this study were drawn from the first wave of a large multiwave cross-sectional monitoring survey, distributed from May 14 to 29, 2020. Participants (N=3000) were adults living in Canada. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample, and bivariate cross-tabulations were used to examine the relationships between the use of AVMH resources and self-reported indicators of mental health that included a range of emotional and coping-related responses to the pandemic. Univariate and fully adjusted multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine associations between sociodemographic and health-related characteristics and use of AVMH resources in the subgroup of participants who reported experiencing one or more adverse mental health impacts identified in the set of self-reported mental health indicators. RESULTS: Among the total sample, 2.0% (n=59) of participants reported accessing AVMH resources in the prior 2 weeks to cope with stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the highest rates of use among individuals who reported self-harm (n=5, 10.4%) and those who reported coping ""not well"" with COVID-19-related stress (n=22, 5.5%). Within the subgroup of 1954 participants (65.1% of the total sample) who reported an adverse mental health impact related to COVID-19, 54 (2.8%) reported use of AVMH resources. Individuals were more likely to have used AVMH resources if they had reported receiving in-person mental health supports, were connecting virtually with a mental health worker or counselor, or belonged to a visible minority group. CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial government investment into AVMH resources, uptake is low among both the general population and individuals who may benefit from the use of these resources as a means of coping with the adverse mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of the barriers to use.","Richardson, Chris G; Slemon, Allie; Gadermann, Anne; McAuliffe, Corey; Thomson, Kimberly; Daly, Zachary; Salway, Travis; Currie, Leanne M; David, Anita; Jenkins, Emily",J Med Internet Res,454,16

PT150 is a member of an extended platform of novel glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and androgen receptor (AR) modulating molecules. In vivo, their predominant net effect is one of systemic glucocorticoid antagonism, but they also show direct downregulation of AR and minor GR agonism at the cellular level. We hypothesize that anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity depends in part on this AR downregulation through diminished TMPRSS2 expression and modulation of ACE2 activity. Given that hypercortisolemia is now suggested to be a significant co-factor for COVID-19 progression, we also postulate an additive role for its potent immunomodulatory effects through systemic antagonism of cortisol.","Theise, Neil D; Arment, Anthony R; Chakravarty, Dimple; Gregg, John M H; Jacobson, Ira M; Jung, Kie Hoon; Nair, Sujit S; Tewari, Ashutosh K; Thurston, Archie W; Van Drie, John; Westover, Jonna B",Cell Cycle,454,1

Patients with MIS-C are prone to gastrointestinal symptoms, coagulopathy, and shock in addition to atypical KD syndrome with fever, mucocutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy, and/or cardiovascular events. MIS-C manifests KD-like symptoms that alert physicians to early recognize and adopt the KD treatment regimen for patients with MIS-C. MIS-C linked to COVID-19 teaches us infection-associated autoimmune vasculitis and vice versa. Studies on genetic susceptibility have identified certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus and toll-like receptor (TLR) associated with KD and/or COVID-19. Certain HLA subtypes, such as HLA-DRB1 and HLA-MICA A4 are associated with KD. HLA-B*46:01 is proposed to be the risk allele of severe COVID-19 infection, and blood group O type is a protective factor of COVID-19. The autoimmune vasculitis of KD, KD shock syndrome (KDSS), or MIS-C is mediated by a genetic variant of HLA, FcÎ³R, and/or antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) resulting in hyperinflammation with T helper 17 (Th17)/Treg imbalance with augmented Th17/Th1 mediators: interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, inducible protein-10 (IP-10), Interferon (IFNÎ³), and IL-17A, and lower expression of Treg-signaling molecules, FoxP3, and transforming growth factor (TGF-ß). There are certain similarities and differences in phenotypes, susceptibility, and pathogenesis of KD, KDSS, and MIS-C, by which a physician can make early protection, prevention, and precision treatment of the diseases. The evolution of immunotherapies for the diseases has shown that intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) alone or combined with corticosteroids is the standard treatment for KD, KDSS, and MIS-C. However, a certain portion of patients who revealed a treatment resistance to IVIG or IVIG plus corticosteroids, posing a need to early identify the immunopathogenesis, to protect hosts with genetic susceptibility, and to combat Th17/Treg imbalance by anti-cytokine or pro-Treg for reversal of the hyperinflammation and IVIG resistance. Based on physiological and pathological immunity of the diseases under genetic susceptibility and host milieu conditions, a series of sequential regimens are provided to develop a so-called ""Know thyself, enemy (pathogen), and ever-victorious"" strategy for the prevention and immunotherapy of KD and/or MIS-C.","Chen, Men-Ren; Kuo, Ho-Chang; Lee, Yann-Jinn; Chi, Hsin; Li, Sung Chou; Lee, Hung-Chang; Yang, Kuender D",Front Immunol,454,16

After pooling the adjusted odds ratios from the included studies, no significant increase was noted in the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by the use of ACE inhibitors (adjusted odds ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.86-1.05]) or ARBs (adjusted odds ratio, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.97-1.14]). However, the random-effects meta-regression revealed that age may modify the SARS-CoV-2 infection risk in subjects with the use of ARBs (coefficient, -0.006 [95% CI, -0.016 to 0.004]), that is, the use of ARBs, as opposed to ACE inhibitors, specifically augmented the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in younger subjects (<60 years old). The use of ACE inhibitors might not increase the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severity of disease, and mortality in case-population and cohort studies.

Particular situations increase susceptibility to infection in neonates. The enhanced susceptibility to certain infections increases the risk of developing particular diseases that can progress to become morbidly severe. For example, during the current pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, epidemiological studies have established that pregnant women with COVID-19 disease are more likely to be hospitalized. However, the risk for intensive care unit admission and mechanical ventilation is not increased compared with nonpregnant women. Although much remains unknown with this particular infection, the elevated risk of progression during pregnancy towards more severe manifestations of COVID-19 disease is not associated with an increased risk of death. In addition, the epidemiological data available in neonates suggest that their risk of acquiring COVID-19 is low compared with infants (<12 months of age). However, they might be at higher risk for progression to severe COVID-19 disease compared with older children. The data on clinical presentation and disease severity among neonates are limited and based on case reports and small case series. It is well documented the importance of the Zika virus infection as the main cause of several congenital anomalies and birth defects such as microcephaly, and also adverse pregnancy outcomes. Mycoplasma infections also increase adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Whether this happens through the diffusion of rumors, viruses, opinions, or know-how, finding the source is of persistent interest to people and an algorithmic challenge of much current research interest. However, no study has considered the case of diffusion sources actively trying to avoid detection. By disregarding this assumption, we risk conflating intentional obfuscation from the fundamental limitations of source-finding algorithms. We close this gap by separating two mechanisms hiding diffusion sources-one stemming from the network topology itself and the other from strategic manipulation of the network. We find that identifying the source can be challenging even without foul play and, many times, it is easy to evade source-detection algorithms further. We show that hiding connections that were part of the viral cascade is far more effective than introducing fake individuals. Thus, efforts should focus on exposing concealed ties rather than planted fake entities, e.g., bots in social media; such exposure would drastically improve our chances of detecting the source of a social diffusion.","Waniek, Marcin; Cebrian, Manuel; Holme, Petter; Rahwan, Talal",,454,29

OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate the experience of fellowship applicants in answering radiology questions in an audiovisual format, using their own smartphones after answering radiology questions in a traditional printed text format as part of the application process during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our hypothesis is that fellowship applicants would find that recorded audiovisual radiology content adds value to the conventional selection process, may increase engagement by using their own smartphone device, and also facilitate understanding of imaging findings of radiology-based questions, while maintaining social distancing. METHODS: One senior staff radiologist of each subspecialty prepared 4 audiovisual radiology questions for each subspecialty. We conducted a survey using online questionnaires for 123 fellowship applications for musculoskeletal (39), internal medicine (61) and neuroradiology (23) programs to evaluate the experience of using audiovisual radiology content as a substitute for the conventional text evaluation. RESULTS: The great majority of the applicants (99%) answered positively (agree or strongly agree) that images in digital forms have superior quality than printed in paper. Eighty-two percent of the applicants agreed with the statement that the presentation of the cases in audiovisual format facilitates the understanding of the findings. Also, most of the candidates agreed or strongly agreed that answering digital forms is more practical than conventional paper forms (65%). CONCLUSIONS: Use of audiovisual content as part of the selection process for radiology fellowships is a new approach to evaluate the potential to enhance the applicant's experience during this process. This technology also allows for the evaluation of candidates without the necessity of in-person interactions. Further studies could streamline these methods in order to minimize work redundancy with traditional text tests or even evaluate the acceptance of using only audiovisual content using smartphones.","Godoy, Ivan Rodrigues Barros; Neto, Luís Pecci; Skaf, Abdalla; Leão-Filho, Hilton Muniz; Freddi, Tomás De Andrade Lourenço; Jasinowodolinski, Dany; Yamada, André Fukunishi",,454,1

So, there is urgent need to search appropriate therapeutic approach by repurposing approved drugs. In this communication, molecular docking analyses of two influenza antiviral drugs baloxavir acid (BXA) and baloxavir marboxil (BXM) were performed with the three therapeutic target proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), i.e., main protease (Mpro), papain-like protease (PLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The molecular docking results of both the drugs BXA and BXM were analysed and compared. The investigational drug BXA binds at the active site of Mpro and RdRp, whereas the approved drug BXM binds only at the active site of RdRp. Also, comparison of dock score revealed that BXA is binding more effectively at the active site of RdRp than BXM. The computational molecular docking revealed that the drug BXA may be more effective against COVID-19 as compared to BXM.","Sahoo, Suban K; Vardhan, Seshu",,454,5

Participants were randomised to receive a dental check-up at six-monthly, 24-monthly or risk-based recall intervals. A two-strata trial design was used, with participants randomised within the 24-month stratum if the recruiting dentist considered them clinically suitable. Participants ineligible for 24-month recall were randomised to a risk-based or six-month recall interval.Setting UK primary dental care.Participants Practices providing NHS care and adults who had received regular dental check-ups.Main outcome measures The percentage of sites with gingival bleeding on probing, oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), cost-effectiveness.Results In total, 2,372 participants were recruited from 51 dental practices. Of those, 648 were eligible for the 24-month recall stratum and 1,724 participants were ineligible. There was no evidence of a significant difference in the mean percentage of sites with gingival bleeding on probing between intervention arms in any comparison. For those eligible for 24-month recall stratum: the 24-month versus six-month group had an adjusted mean difference of -0.91%, 95% CI (-5.02%, 3.20%); the 24-month group versus risk-based group had an adjusted mean difference of 0.07%, 95% CI (-3.99%, 4.12%). For the overall sample, the risk-based versus six-month adjusted mean difference was 0.78%, 95% CI (-1.17%, 2.72%). There was no evidence of a difference in OHRQoL (0-56 scale, higher score for poorer OHRQoL) between intervention arms in any comparison. For the overall sample, the risk-based versus six-month effect size was -0.35, 95% CI (-1.02, 0.32). There was no evidence of a clinically meaningful difference between the groups in any comparison in either eligibility stratum for any of the secondary clinical or patient-reported outcomes.Conclusion Over a four-year period, we found no evidence of a difference in oral health for participants allocated to a six-month or a risk-based recall interval, nor between a 24-month, six-month or risk-based recall interval for participants eligible for a 24-month recall.

Method: Two prospective cycles at a District General Hospital. First cycle: three-month period (October-December 2018);recorded all patients admitted with epistaxis and the percentage with intranasal packing;criteria for discharge with unilateral intranasal packing created (including normal observations, normal clotting/haemoglobin, only on aspirin, safe home environment). Second cycle (after implementation of new pathway): two months (December 2019 and January 2020);recorded all patients admitted with epistaxis or discharged with unilateral intranasal packing;patient feedback obtained. Results: First cycle: 31 epistaxis admissions;12 patients met discharge criteria;average length of stay was 1.4 days. Second cycle: 22 epistaxis admissions;4 admissions were avoided;2 admissions were unnecessary according to new pathway;no patient-reported issues with pack at home. Conclusions: Successful creation and initial implementation of pathway with no adverse outcomes. Approximately £1380 of savings through avoided admissions.

In December 2019, a new infectious respiratory disease emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China and was named by the World Health Organization as COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). A new class of corona virus, known as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has been found to be responsible for occurrence of this disease. Almost all the nations are struggling to slow down the transmission of the disease by testing & treating patients, quarantining suspected persons through contact tracing, restricting large gatherings, maintaining complete or partial lock down etc.It is been reported that 81% of the worldwide workforce has been affected by workplace changes due to improper working style. Neck pain is among the most common pain problems, with a reported prevalence which is ranging from 22% to 30%. Neck pain is usually associated with headache, upper back and shoulder/arm pain. Neck and LBP are prevalent, are major causes of work disability. Because of this typically recurrent character, it has been suggested that adherence to self-management strategies learned while actively participating in physical therapy and/or pain clinics may avoid many recurrent cases and have a profound influence on long-term care. Aim and Objective: To study the effects of Mulligan fist traction and MFR on Trapezius muscle on neck pain and disability. Methodology: 40 participants were selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and consent was taken. Participants of the study were given Mulligan fist traction and MFR of trapezius muscle along with some neck and upper back exercises. Participants were assessed for neck pain and disability using neck pain and disability scale and readings were noted. Assessment was done on pre and post intervention on Day 1, 7, and 14. Result: The P value was recorded as&lt;0.0001 Conclusion:In this study we concluded that, Mulligan fist traction, MFR of trapezius muscle and neck exercises help in improving the overall neck health in terms of pain and disability.","Khatri, S.; Mahendrakar, V.",Turkish Journal of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation,454,1

METHODS: Retrospective review of patients undergoing open surgery for stage III or IVa thymoma between 2016 and 2020 at a single centre was performed. Preoperative imaging, treatment plan, surgical approach, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients underwent surgery for thymoma. Patients with clinical stage I/II thymoma or minimally invasive thymectomy were excluded. Thirteen patients with clinical stage III or IVa were included. Median sternotomy approach was used in four patients, of which one was redo sternotomy; a hemi-clamshell in four; and a combination of approaches in the remaining five patients. There was no postoperative mortality. Four patients had postoperative complications. Complete resection was achieved in all but two patients.

Although several other mutants were previously reported, VUI-202012/01 proved to be about 70% more transmissible. Hence, the usefulness and effectiveness of the newly U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved COVID-19 vaccines against these new variants are doubtfully questioned. As a result of these unexpected mutants from COVID-19 and due to lack of time, much research interest is directed toward assessing secondary metabolites as potential candidates for developing lead pharmaceuticals. In this study, a marine-derived fungus Aspergillus terreus was investigated, affording two butenolide derivatives, butyrolactones I (1) and III (2), a meroterpenoid, terretonin (3), and 4-hydroxy-3-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)benzaldehyde (4).

PD can arise from monogenic mutations, but in most cases, the etiology is unclear. Viral infection is gaining increasing attentions as a trigger of PD. In this study, we investigated whether the PD-causative 620 aspartate (D) to asparagine (N) mutation in the vacuolar protein sorting 35 ortholog (Vps35) precipitated herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. We observed that ectopic expression of Vps35 significantly reduced the proliferation and release of HSV-1 virions; the D620N mutation rendered Vps35 a partial loss of such inhibitory effects. Tetherin is a host cell protein capable of restricting the spread of encapsulated viruses including HSV-1 and SARS-Cov-2, both of which are implicated in the development of parkinsonism. Compared with cells overexpressing wildtype Vps35, cells expressing mutant Vps35 with D620N had less Tetherin on cell surfaces. Real-time and static cell imaging revealed that Tetherin recycled through Vps35-positive endosomes. Expression of Vps35 with D620N reduced endosomal dynamics and frequency of motile Tetherin-containing vesicles, a sign of defective production of recycling carriers. Our study suggests that the D620N mutation in Vps35 hinders Tetherin trafficking to cell surfaces and facilitates virus spread.","Ding, Yingzhuo; Li, Yan; Chhetri, Gaurav; Peng, Xiaoxin; Wu, Jing; Wang, Zejian; Zhao, Bo; Zhao, Wenjuan; Li, Xueyi",,454,16

COVID-19 measures can increase stress in people with intellectual disabilities, although some people may adapt to or grow from these uncertain situations. Resilience is the process of effectively negotiating, adapting to, or managing significant sources of stress and trauma. The current study aims to provide professional carers with new insights into how they can support people with intellectual disabilities. METHOD: An online survey was shared through the social media and organizational newsletters of MEE ZHN (a non-governmental organization for people with disabilities). The resilience framework by Ungar (2019) was adapted to fit to people with intellectual disabilities during COVID-19 measures. Statistical analyses were performed in SPSS statistics version 26. RESULTS: Results show that professional carers applied diverse and distal methods to maintain contact with people with intellectual disabilities during the COVID-19 measures.

Thus, this paper aims to report on lessons learned from a blended professional development (PD) program for elementary and middle school teachers in Japan focused on computer programming education. In particular, the authors explored how application of the creative learning principles in the blended teacher PD may have helped to nurture a community of practice among teachers in Japan, and how the creative learning principles may be a valuable framework for designing online or blended teacher PD to support teachers’ transition into emergency remote education. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reports on the lessons learned from two iterations of blended teacher PD situated within a larger design-based research project on applying creative learning pedagogy in teacher PD. Creative learning is a learning approach focused on engagement in personally meaningful projects by tinkering with materials and learning from peers. A total of 26 teachers and coaches participated, all of whom work in elementary or middle schools across Nagano prefecture in Japan. Participant experiences were evaluated based on a pre-survey and a post-survey conducted before and after the in-person kick-off camp; observation notes taken; a final report submitted by each teacher; a debrief meeting at the end of the program; and semi-structured interviews with three selected participants after the program concluded. For this paper, the authors focus on two participants who fully and actively engaged in the program, and they introduce their stories to highlight the outcomes from the PD. Findings: The results highlight how a blended PD designed to support creative learning of teachers provided teachers with opportunities to gain help from other teachers and cultivate their expertise. The results also illustrated that how a community of practice emerged from the PD program, providing teachers with moral support when they tried new lesson designs. This paper offers several recommendations for designing professional learning experiences for instructional designers and professional developers that incorporate remote learning technologies. Originality/value: While an increased number of studies have shown the values of online and blended communities of practice for teacher PD, there are still limited insights on different strategies to support teachers in transforming their teaching practices. They generally do not provide teachers with opportunities to continue learning with and from one another beyond the program itself. This study examined the teachers’ experiences in a unique PD that implemented a creative learning approach into a blended learning environment for teachers.","Murai, Yumiko; Muramatsu, Hiroyuki",inform.Learn.Sci,454,29

Unfortunately, many front-line treatment providers do not utilize CM, likely due to contextual barriers that limit effective training and ongoing support for evidence-based practices. This study applied user-informed approaches to adapt a multi-level implementation strategy called the Science to Service Laboratory (SSL) to support CM implementation. METHODS: Leaders and treatment providers working in community-based opioid treatment programs (OTPs; N = 43) completed qualitative interviews inquiring about their preferences for training and support implementation strategies (didactic training, performance feedback, and external facilitation). Our team coded interviews using a reflexive team approach to identify common a priori and emergent themes. RESULTS: Leaders and providers expressed a preference for brief training that included case examples and research data, along with experiential learning strategies. They reported a desire for performance feedback from internal supervisors, patients, and clinical experts. Providers and leaders had mixed feelings about audio-recording sessions but were open to the use of rating sheets to evaluate CM performance. Finally, participants desired both on-call and regularly scheduled external facilitation to support their continued use of CM. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an exemplar of a user-informed approach to adapt the SSL implementation support strategies for CM scale-up in community OTPs. Study findings highlight the need for user-informed approaches to training, performance feedback, and facilitation to support sustained CM use in this setting.","Scott, Kelli; Jarman, Shelly; Moul, Samantha; Murphy, Cara M; Yap, Kimberly; Garner, Bryan R; Becker, Sara J",Implement Sci Commun,454,22

To resolve this inconsistency, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to precisely examine the association between BMI and UTI. METHODS: This meta-analysis was performed based on the PRISMA recommendations. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar databases were searched for all published observational studies that reported the risk of UTI based on BMI categories up to March 2020. RESULTS: Fourteen (n = 14) articles comprising 19 studies in different populations met our inclusion criteria. The overall analysis showed a significant increased risk of UTI in subjects affected by obesity vs. individuals without obesity (RR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.28 - 1.63; I2 = 94%), and a non-significant increased risk of UTI in subjects who were overweight (RR = 1.03; 95% CI: 0.98 - 1.10; I2 = 49.6%) and underweight (RR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.81 - 21; I2 = 0.0%) when compared to subjects who had normal weight. In the stratified analysis, we showed that obesity increased the risk of UTI in females (RR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.38 - 1.93) and in subjects below 60 years old (RR = 1.53; 95% CI: 1.33 - 1.75). CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis recognized a significant relationship between BMI and incidence of UTI in obese vs. non-obese subjects, as well as in females and in individuals below 60 years old.","Alhabeeb, Habeeb; Baradwan, Saeed; Kord-Varkaneh, Hamed; Tan, Shing Cheng; Low, Teck Yew; Alomar, Osama; Salem, Hany; Al-Badawi, Ismail Abdulrahman; Abu-Zaid, Ahmed",Eat. weight disord,454,14

This review was based on an electronic search of the literature in the Scopus, Science Direct, and PubMed database published from December 2019 to July 2020 using combinations of the following keywords: SARS-CoV-2 transmission, COVID-19 transmission, coronavirus transmission, waterborne, wastewater, airborne, fomites, and fecal-oral transmission. Studies suggest the thermal properties of ambient air, as well as relative humidity, may affect the transmissibility and viability of the virus. Samples taken from the wastewater collection network were detected contaminated with the novel coronavirus; consequently, there is a concern of its transmission via an urban sewer system. There are concerns about the efficacy of the wastewater treatment plant disinfection process as the last chance to inactivate the virus. Handling solid waste also requires an utmost caution as it may contain infectious masks, etc. Following the PRISMA approach, among all reviewed studies, more than 36% of them were directly or indirectly related to the indoor and outdoor environment, 16% to meteorological factors, 11% to wastewater, 14% to fomites, 8% to water, 9% to solid waste, and 6% to the secondary environment.

Plastics in terms of personal protective equipment (PPEs) and other single-use medical equipment along with packaging solutions owing to their inherent properties have emerged as a life-savior for protecting the health and safety of the frontline health workers and the common citizens during the pandemic. However, plastics have been deemed as evil polluter due to their indiscriminate littering and mismanagement amid increased plastic usage and waste generation during this unprecedented crisis. This article reviews and assesses to dwell upon whether plastics in the time of pandemic are acting as protector of the public health or polluter of the environment. Considering the utilities and limitations of plastic along with its management or mismanagement, and the fate, an equitable appraisal suggests that the consumers' irresponsible behavior, and attitude and poor awareness, and the stress on waste management infrastructure in terms of collection, operation, and financial constraints as the major drivers, leading to mismanagement, turn plastic into an evil polluter of the environment. Plastic can be a protector if managed properly and complemented by the circular economy strategies in terms of reduction, recycle and recovery, and thereby preventing leakage into the environment. To safeguard the supply chain of PPEs, several decontamination techniques have been adopted worldwide ensuring their effective reprocessing to prioritize the circular economy within the system. Policy guidelines encouraging to adopt safer practices and sustainable technical solutions along with consumers' education for awareness creation are the need of the hour for preventing plastic to turn from protector with high utility to polluter.","Parashar, Neha; Hait, Subrata",Sci Total Environ,454,24

The current review meticulously summarizes the COVID-19 pandemic situation through the lens of science from the inception of the outbreak to the current progression, which is valuable to mitigate the current pandemic situation. METHODS: We reviewed all the relevant literature available on PubMed, Web of Sciences, Google Scholar, and World Health Organization (WHO) website related to COVID-19 from the inception of the outbreak to 18 June 2020. We selected ninety different scientific studies and reports to compile the current review. RESULTS: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a betacoronavirus with four major structural proteins encoded by S, M, E, and N genes and distinct in morphology. The potential provenance of SARS-Cov-2 is zoonotic, and it binds to the host cell receptors by spike protein. The SARS-CoV-2 infectious cycle carries on through direct contact, air, inanimate objects, and contaminated surfaces. The reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 is 2 to 3.5, representing that one infected patient can spread this virus to two to three people. An expeditious laboratory diagnosis has a pivotal role in patient management and prevention. Due to the lack of definitive treatment, symptomatic medication regimen and supportive organ therapies are adapted for debilitated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Nucleoside analogs and protease-inhibitors have approved to attenuate the viral infection until the discovery of a specific drug. The other treatment strategies comprise antimalarial drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and glucocorticoids. The use of alcoholic scrubs, sodium hypochlorite, masks, social distancing, and quarantine the affected individual is inevitable to eradicate the infection vector and to break the transmission path.","Alsrhani, Abdullah; Junaid, Kashaf; Younas, Sonia; Hamam, Sanaa S M; Ejaz, Hasan",Clin. lab,454,10

It has led to economic crises and health emergencies across the world, spreading rapidly among the human population and has caused many deaths. Currently, there are no treatments available for COVID-19 so there is an urgent need to develop therapeutic interventions that could be used against the novel coronavirus infection. In this research, we used computational drug design technologies to repurpose existing drugs as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. The Broad Institute's Drug Repurposing Hub consists of in-development/approved drugs and was computationally screened to identify potential hits which could inhibit protein targets encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome. By virtually screening the Broad collection, using rationally designed pharmacophore features, we identified molecules which may be repurposed against viral nucleocapsid and non-structural proteins. The pharmacophore features were generated after careful visualisation of the interactions between co-crystalised ligands and the protein binding site. The ChEMBL database was used to determine the compound's level of inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 and correlate the predicted viral protein target with whole virus in vitro data. The results from this study may help to accelerate drug development against COVID-19 and the hit compounds should be progressed through further in vitro and in vivo studies on SARS-CoV-2.","Kandwal, Shubhangi; Fayne, Darren",J Biomol Struct Dyn,454,16

AIM: To assess the effect of clinical and demographic parameters (age, gender, body mass index (BMI), glycemic control (HbA1c), and antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs, including ACE inhibitors and ARBs) on clinical outcomes (recovery or death) in patients with type 2 DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the Russian Register of Diabetes database was performed, including patients with type 2 DM (n=309) who suffered pneumonia/COVID-19 in the period from 01.02.2020 to 27.04.2020 and the indicated outcome of the disease (recovery or death) RESULTS: The percentage of lethality was determined to be 15.2% (47 of 309 people). The degree of lethality was found to be significantly higher in males (OR=2.08; 95% CI 1.1&ndash;3.9; p=0.022) and in patients on insulin therapy (OR=2.67; 95% CI; 1.42&ndash;5.02; p=0.002), while it was significantly lower in patients with an age &lt;65 years (OR=0.34; 95% CI 0.18&ndash;0.67; p=0.001) and in patients receiving metformin (OR=0.26; 95% CI 0.14&ndash;0,5; p&lt;0.0001), antihypertensive therapy (OR=0.43; 95% CI 0.22&ndash;0.82; p=0.009), &beta;-blockers (OR=0.26; 95% CI 0.08&ndash;0.86; p=0.018), diuretics (OR=0.4; 95% CI 0.17&ndash;0.93; p=0.028) and renin-angiotensin system blockers (ACE inhibitors or ARBs) (OR=0.36; 95% CI 0.18&ndash;0.74; p=0.004). A tendency to an increase in lethality at higher rates of HbA1c and BMI was present, but it did not reach a statistical significance. Differences between patients receiving insulin therapy and those who were not receiving the insulin therapy were observed as follows: a significantly longer duration of type 2 DM (13.4 vs. 6.8 years, respectively; p&lt;0.0001), worse overall glyacemic control (HbA1c: 8.1% vs. 7.0%, resp.; p&lt;0.0001), and three times more frequent failure to achieve the HbA1c goal by more than 2.5% (14.7% vs. 5.9%, resp.; p=0.04). CONCLUSION: The identified risk factors for lethality in patients with type 2 DM indicate that good glycemic control and previous treatment with metformin and antihypertensive drugs (including RAS blockers) could reduce the frequency of deaths. In patients on insulin therapy, a higher lethality degree was associated with worse glycemic control.","Shestakova, Marina V; Vikulova, Olga K; Isakov, Mikhail Ð; Dedov, Ivan I",Probl Endokrinol (Mosk),454,1

Many drugs have been screened, and even their clinical trials are going on at an exceptional pace. Amongst these RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitors (favipiravir and remdesivir) and steroids especially dexamethasone showed promising effects. The biological agents like tocilizumab, interferons, and convalescent plasma prove to be beneficial in viral clearance. Moreover, many immunomodulatory and viral S protein targeting vaccines have their ongoing clinical trials. The establishment of various in vitro and in vivo models for preclinical studies can additionally help the current research. The volume and the pace of the clinical trials launched to evaluate the safety and efficacy of various agents against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reflect the need for high-quality evidence for various therapies to be practiced by clinicians. This study aims to sum up all the current advances in the global medicinal system against the COVID-19.","Chibber, Pankaj; Haq, Syed Assim; Ahmed, Irfan; Andrabi, Nusrit Iqbal; Singh, Gurdarshan",Eur J Pharmacol,454,1
438027,438027,438027,145th Annual Meeting American Neurological Association,10.697839,3.203423,2020,"This is a survey study concerning osteoporosis care during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands. Respondents reported that osteoporosis care stagnated and lower quality of care was provided. This leads to the conclusion that standardization of osteoporosis care delivery in situations of crisis is needed. PURPOSE: During the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no guidance of professional societies or guidelines on the organization of osteoporosis care in case of such a crisis, and treatment relied on local ad hoc strategies. Experiences from the current pandemic need to be taken into account for the near future, and therefore, a national multidisciplinary survey was carried out in the Netherlands. METHODS: A survey of 17 questions concerning the continuation of bone mineral density measurements by Dual Energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), outpatient clinic visits, and prescription of medication was sent to physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants working in the field of osteoporosis. RESULTS: 77 respondents finished the questionnaire, of whom 39 (50.6%) reported a decline in DXA-scanning and 36 (46.8%) no scanning at all during the pandemic. There was an increase in remote consultations for both new and control patient visits (n = 48, 62.3%; n = 62, 81.7% respectively). Lower quality of care regarding fracture prevention was reported by more than half of the respondents (n = 44, 57.1%). Treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates and denosumab was delayed according to 35 (45.4%) and 6 (6.3%) of the respondents, respectively. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, osteoporosis care almost completely arrested, especially because of the discontinuation of DXA-scanning and closing of outpatient clinics. More than half of the respondents reported a substantial lower quality of osteoporosis care during the COVID pandemic. To prevent an increase in fracture rates and a decrease in patient motivation, adherence and satisfaction, standardization of osteoporosis care delivery in situations of crisis is needed.","Peeters, Joséphine Jeanne Maria; van den Berg, Peter; van den Bergh, Joop P; Emmelot-Vonk, Marielle H; de Klerk, Gijs; Lems, Willem F; Winter, Elizabeth M; Zillikens, M Carola; Appelman-Dijkstra, Natasha M",Arch Osteoporos,454,1

These types of services, which enable anyone to broadcast and consume live content, are revolutionising the current video game landscape. Users approach the emergence of and participation in these platforms driven by a range of motivations. It is essential to characterise the different forms of participation in services such as Twitch to evaluate the phenomenon and reflect on its advantages and disadvantages. To that end, a survey was carried out of 580 young people and adolescents aged between 14 and 24. The aim of this study is thus to explore the uptake of these platforms, as well as identify user groups, distinguish between different motivations, and address the associated benefits and harms. Applying a methodology based on factor analysis and cluster analysis, user profiles were characterised according to their specific features, gaming/viewing hours, self-perception of their skill level as a player, devices used, and type or genre of video game. Four subgroups of gamers/viewers were thus identified: casual, social, hobby, and problematic. The results showed that older users and female users feature more prominently in the first two groups, as do those spending less time on video games and live streaming platforms. Conversely, in the hobby and problematic groups, we observe just the opposite. The existence of profiles at possible risk of addiction underlines how, at a preventive level, there is a need for more in-depth research on these types of services and greater public awareness of the dangers of uncontrolled use.","Cabeza-Ramírez, Luis Javier; Muñoz-Fernández, Guzmán Antonio; Santos-Roldán, Luna",,454,10

Over recent years, drug repurposing has been accomplished as an important opportunity in drug development as it shortens the time consumed for development, besides sparing the cost and the efforts exerted in the research and development process. The FDA-approved antiparasitic drug, nitazoxanide (NTZ), has been found to have antiviral activity against different viral infections such as coronaviruses, influenza, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and other viruses signifying its potential as a broad spectrum antiviral drug. Moreover, it has been recently reported that NTZ exhibited in vitro inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at a small micromolar concentration. Additionally, NTZ suppresses the production of cytokines emphasizing its potential to manage COVID-19-induced cytokine storm. Furthermore, the reported efficacy of NTZ to bronchodilate the extremely contracted airways can be beneficial in alleviating COVID-19-associated symptoms. SHORT CONCLUSION: All these findings, along with the high safety record of the drug, have gained our interest to urge conductance of clinical trials to assess the potential benefits of using it in COVID-19 patients. Thus, in this summarized article, we review the antiviral activities of NTZ and highlight its promising therapeutic actions that make the drug worth clinical trials.","Mahmoud, Dina B; Shitu, Zayyanu; Mostafa, Ahmed",J Genet Eng Biotechnol,454,26

Here, we show that functionalized nanoparticles, termed ""Nanotraps,"" completely inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the interaction between the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and the ACE2 of host cells. The liposomal-based Nanotrap surfaces were functionalized with either recombinant ACE2 proteins or anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies and phagocytosis-specific phosphatidylserines. The Nanotraps effectively captured SARS-CoV-2 and completely blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection to ACE2-expressing human cell lines and primary lung cells; the phosphatidylserine triggered subsequent phagocytosis of the virus-bound, biodegradable Nanotraps by macrophages, leading to the clearance of pseudotyped and authentic virus in vitro. Furthermore, the Nanotraps demonstrated an excellent biosafety profile in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the Nanotraps inhibited pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infection in live human lungs in an ex vivo lung perfusion system. In summary, Nanotraps represent a new nanomedicine for the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Chen, Min; Rosenberg, Jillian; Cai, Xiaolei; Hsuan Lee, Andy Chao; Shi, Jiuyun; Nguyen, Mindy; Wignakumar, Thirushan; Mirle, Vikranth; Edobor, Arianna Joy; Fung, John; Donington, Jessica Scott; Shanmugarajah, Kumaran; Lin, Yiliang; Chang, Eugene; Randall, Glenn; Penaloza-MacMaster, Pablo; Tian, Bozhi; Madariaga, Maria Lucia; Huang, Jun",,454,1

Until August24, 2020, we searched Web of Sciences, Scopus, and MEDLINE/PubMed databases to achieve related papers. Summary points and lines of included studies were calculated from 2×2 tables by bivariate/hierarchical models. Critical condition and mortality were considered as outcomes. A total of 13387 patients from 28 studies were included in this study. Six biomarkers containing leukocytosis, neutrophilia, lymphopenia, increased level of C-reactive protein, procalcitonin (PCT), and ferritin met the inclusion criteria. Analysis of the area under the curve (AUCHSROC) indicated that the PCT was the only applicable prognostic biomarker for critical condition and mortality (AUCHSROC=0.80 for both conditions). Pooled-diagnostic odds ratios were 6.78 (95% CI, 3.65-12.61) for prognosis of critical condition and 13.21 (95% CI, 3.95-44.19) for mortality. Other biomarkers had insufficient accuracies for both conditions (AUCHSROC< 0.80). Among evaluated biomarkers, only PCT has good accuracy for the prognosis of both critical condition and mortality in COVID-19 and it can be considered as a single prognostic biomarker for poor outcomes.

In this work we focus on the evolution of the COVID-19 in one of the most populous Brazilian states, namely the Rio de Janeiro state. The first case was reported in March 5, 2020, thus we have a considerable amount of available data to make a good analysis. We study the dynamics of COVID-19 through a Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model with an additional mechanism that represents the implementation of public policies of social isolation. Based on the data collected from the Rio de Janeiro state Department of Health from March 5, 2020 through April 26, 2020, we observed that the implementation of social distancing policies changed the initial exponential growth to a sub-exponential one. The SIQR model with the above-mentioned mechanism is capable of reproducing the data of confirmed cases in Rio de Janeiro, and it explains how that change occurred. The model also predicts an important mitigation effect, namely the flattening effect, i.e., the considerably decrease of the maximum number of confirmed cases. Through the results of the model, this effect can be directly related to the social isolation policies. Finally, we consider the relaxation of such policies, and discuss about the ideal period of time to release people to return to their activities.","Crokidakis, Nuno",Chaos Solitons Fractals,454,28

Because of their novelty, there are limited measures available to control their early spread. Learning from past outbreaks is important for future preparation. The Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus (MERS‐CoV ) 2015 outbreak in the Republic of Korea (ROK) provides one such opportunity. OBJECTIVES: We demonstrated through quantitative methodologies how to estimate MERS‐CoV's transmissibility and identified the effective countermeasures that stopped its spread. METHODS: Using the outbreak data, statistical methods were employed to estimate the basic reproductive number R (0), the average number of secondary cases produced by a typical primary case during its entire infectious period in a fully susceptible population. A transmission dynamics model was also proposed to estimate R (0) and to identify the most effective countermeasures. The consistency between results will provide cross‐validation of the approaches. RESULTS: R (0) ranged from 2.5 with 95% confidence interval (CI): [1.7, 3.1] (using the sequential Bayesian method) to 7.2 with 95% CI: [5.3, 9.4] (using the Nowcasting method). Estimates from transmission model were higher but overlapped with these. Personal protection and rapid confirmation of cases were identified as the most important countermeasures. CONCLUSIONS: Our estimates were in agreement with others from the ROK outbreak, albeit significantly higher than estimates based on other small outbreaks and sporadic cases of MERS‐CoV. The large‐scale outbreak in the ROK was jointly due to the high transmissibility in the healthcare‐associated setting and the Korean culture‐associated contact behaviour. Limiting such behaviour by rapidly identifying and isolating cases and avoiding high‐risk contacts effectively stopped further transmission.","Zhang, Xu‐Sheng; Pebody, Richard; Charlett, Andre; de Angelis, Daniela; Birrell, Paul; Kang, Hunseok; Baguelin, Marc; Choi, Yoon Hong",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,454,20

METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases was conducted to assess the inpatient status assigned to intravenous vancomycin and factors associated with the cost of treatment during two periods of implementing ASP, which were i) from April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2018 (previous ASP-pASP) and ii) from June 1, 2018 to March 31, 2020 (new ASP-nASP). RESULTS: Among 1375 patients who met the sampling criteria, there were 601 and 774 patients in pASP and nASP, respectively. The rate of no improvement/mortality in the pASP was higher than that in nASP (37.10% vs 25.98%, p <0.05). The proportion of patients with two or more infection episodes in nASP is lower than that in pASP (9.83% vs 18.64%, p<0.05). Besides, nASP has higher length of therapy (LOT) and higher day of therapy (DOT).

On the other hand, the nASP has five factors (p<0.001), in which the log(LOT) and age are not as statistically significant (p=0.5127 and 0.3852, respectively) as in the pASP model. CONCLUSION: The implementation and improvement of the ASP at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases have initially shown benefits for patients using intravenous vancomycin. Specifically, the ASP helps to reduce treatment costs, improve patient outcomes, reduce length of stay and decrease the average daily dose of vancomycin.","Nguyen-Thi, Hai-Yen; Nguyen, Duy-Anh; Huynh, Phuong-Thao; Le, Nguyen Dang Tu",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,454,30

Design A case–control study. Setting Tertiary Hospital for Infectious Disease. Sample Ten pregnant and 40 non‐pregnant female patients infected with SARS. Methods Clinical course and outcomes of pregnant SARS patients were compared with a group of non‐pregnant SARS patient. Cases and controls were matched with respect to sex, age, timing of contracting SARS, health care workers status and underlying illness. Main outcome measures The incidence of intensive care unit admission, intubation, medical complications and death rate. Results Pregnancy had no discernible impact on clinical symptoms and presentation delay. Four out of the 10 pregnant patients, nevertheless, required endotracheal intubation and six were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), as compared with 12.5% intubation rate (P= 0.065) and 17.5% ICU admission rate (P= 0.012) in the non‐pregnant group. More pregnant SARS patients developed renal failure (P= 0.006) and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (P= 0.006), as compared with non‐pregnant SARS group.

These masks are classified as single-use medical products with a very short service life, estimated at few days, hence millions of contaminated masks are generated daily in the form of hazardous materials, what requires to develop a safe method to dispose of them, especially since some of them are loaded with viruses. 3-ply face masks (3PFM) represent the major fraction of this waste and are composed mainly from polypropylene and melt blown filter with high content of volatile substances (96.6 wt.%), what makes pyrolysis treatment an emerging technology that could be used to dispose of face masks and convert them into energy products. In this context, this work aims to study pyrolysis kinetic behaviour and TG-FTIR-GC–MS analysis of 3PFM. The research started with analysis of 3PFM using elemental analysis, proximate analysis, and compositional analyses. Afterwards, TG-FTIR system was used to study the thermal and chemical decomposition of 3PFM analyzed at different heating rates: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C/min. The GC/MS system was used to observe the synthesized volatile products at the maximum decomposition temperatures. After that, isoconversional methods, the advanced nonlinear integral isoconversional method, and the iterative linear integral isoconversional method were used to determine the activation energies of mask pyrolysis, while the distributed activation energy model and the independent parallel reactions kinetic model were used to fit TGA and DTG curves with deviations below <1. The TGA-DTG results showed that 3PFM can decompose in three different periods with a total weight loss of 95 % and maximum decomposition in the range 405−510 °C, while the FTIR spectra and GC–MS analysis exhibited that – C—H (aromatic and aliphatic) and 2,4-Dimethyl-1-heptene (28–43 % based on heating rate) represented the major compounds in the released volatile components. Finally, Vyazovkin and the iterative linear integral isoconversional methods gave activation energies almost similar to that obtained by the KAS isoconversional method.","Yousef, Samy; Eimontas, Justas; Striūgas, Nerijus; Abdelnaby, Mohammed Ali",J Anal Appl Pyrolysis,454,16

We argue that the public's perception of urban companion animals during emerging infectious disease outbreaks is related to medical and life science issues and reflects the political, economic, and emotional struggles involved in human-animal multispecies cohabitation. We find that the public has mainly followed and reconstructed medical discourses about the risk of companion animal-to-human transmission and discussed sustainable ethical animal practices in urban public health emergency management during the COVID-19 outbreak. Concerns regarding the risk of companion animal-related infection reflect the increasing prominence of more-than-human families, the pet industry, and multispecies leisure conflicts in public space in Chinese cities. The public's attention to animal ethics has prompted Chinese policy makers to adopt a more morally acceptable model for urban public health emergency management that can be sustained and supported by responsible non-governmental organizations and ethical urban residents.","Yin, Duo; Gao, Quan; Zhu, Hong; Li, Jie",Health Place,454,20

OBJECTIVE We describe a local experience of the management of MM patients and report their outcomes during the current pandemic. METHODS All consecutive symptomatic MM patients seen at our center since 03/20 were evaluated. RESULTS A cohort of 156 patients diagnosed from 01/19 to 12/20 was analyzed to interrogate differences in presentation patterns. A total of 553 MM patients were seen and/or treated at Tom Baker Cancer Center in the year of 2020. From those, 47.1% (n = 261) were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Sixteen patients tested positive and data are presented. In addition, a decrease of 21.7% in the rate of new smoldering MM/MM diagnosis was observed in 2020 as compared to 2019. Further, an increase in deaths was also observed in 2020. CONCLUSIONS Our study confirms an increase lethality for MM patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

The current global statistics for the disease are 111 million cases and 2.45 million deaths, with new cases emerging each day. Although several drugs including remdesivir have been approved for emergency use, they remain ineffective in bringing the infection under control. Therefore, there is a need for highly effective and safe vaccines against COVID-19. The recent advancements in mRNA vaccines have catapulted them to be forefront in the race to develop vaccines for COVID-19. Two mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Therapeutics, respectively, have been granted authorization for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration. Interim analysis of the clinical trials for BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines reported an efficacy of 95% and 94.1%, respectively, after the second dose. The adverse events for both the vaccines have been found to be mild to moderate, with mostly injection-site reactions and fatigue. No serious adverse events have been reported. Moreover, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Therapeutics have announced that their vaccines are effective even against the new strains (B.1.17 and B.1.351) of the virus. Both companies are now scaling up the production of the vaccines to meet the global demand. Although the long-term efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of these vaccines is uncertain, there is hope that they can turn the tables against COVID-19 in this current pandemic situation.","Deva Priya, Sagili Anthony; Kavitha, Shivakumar; Venugopal, Priyanka; Sriram, Damal Kandadai; George, Melvin",Clin Drug Investig,454,12

We demonstrate this principle with the detection of five viral pathogens; Hepatitis A virus, Hepatitis C virus, West Nile Virus, Human Immune Deficiency virus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus. Oligonucleotides are designed complementary to a target sequence of interest containing a 3′ universal fluorescence dye. A 5′ thiol causes the oligonucleotides to self-assemble onto the metal nanowire. The single-stranded oligonucleotide contains a self-complementary hairpin stem sequence of 10 bases that forces the 3′ fluorophore to come into contact with the metallic nanowire surface, thereby quenching the fluorescence. Upon addition of target DNA, there is hybridization with the complementary oligonucleotides. The resulting DNA hybrid is rigid, unfolds the hairpin structure, and causes the fluorophore to be moved away from the surface such that it is no longer quenched. By using differently encoded nanowires, each conjugated with a different oligonucleotide sequence, multiplexed DNA assays are possible using a single fluorophore, from a multiplexed RT-PCR reaction.","Sha, Michael Y.; Yamanaka, Mark; Walton, Ian D.; Norton, Scott M.; Stoermer, Rebecca L.; Keating, Christine D.; Natan, Michael J.; Penn, Sharron G.",Nanobiotechnology,454,20

Here, we exploit advances in protein structure fingerprint technology to study the folding conformational changes induced by mutations. With the integration of both protein sequences and folding conformations and alignments of SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2, the UK variant and India variant, we found that structural variations in the spike protein at the binding interface interacting with ACE2 play a critical role in coronavirus entry into human cells. Additionally, the structural variations impact vaccine effectiveness and drug function over the course of SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

Moreover, there are no treatments of proven efficacy to reduce the progression of the disease from mild/moderate to severe/critical.

Neither individual findings nor combinations of findings are specific enough to be able to diagnose COVID-19 with a high degree of certainty. The goal was to identify patients in the emergency department, who are at risk for COVID-19 disease, early by using a score, so that they could be isolated pre-emptively. METHOD: Development and implementation of a symptom-based COVID-19 score based on a multicentric retrospective evaluation in three German emergency departments from 9 March until 30 April 2020 of patients suspected of having COVID-19 and subsequent SARS-CoV‑2 PCR testing. RESULTS: The study population included 697 patients and 9.4% of these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. A COVID-19 score of ≥5 points was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of illness. The sensitivity of the score was 98.4% with a moderate specificity of 48.3%. DISCUSSION: The score, which is easy to obtain during the initial assessment, supports the assessment of the pretest probability for a COVID-19 infection as part of the risk stratification and can influence the treatment pathway in terms of pre-emptive isolation, PCR testing and other treatment options at an early stage. Due to the nonspecific symptoms of the disease; however, it must be accepted that the goal of high sensitivity results in a relatively low specificity of the score.","Hüfner, A.; Kiefl, D.; Baacke, M.; Zöllner, R.; Loza Mencía, E.; Schellein, O.; Avan, N.; Pemmerl, S.",Med Klin Intensivmed Notfmed,454,27

Although public health guidelines initially helped to slow the spread of disease, widespread pandemic fatigue and prolonged harm to financial stability and mental well-being contributed to this resurgence. In the late stage of the pandemic, it became clear that new interventions were needed to support long-term behavior change. Here, we examined subjective perceived risk about COVID-19 and the relationship between perceived risk and engagement in risky behaviors. In study 1 (n = 303), we found that subjective perceived risk was likely inaccurate but predicted compliance with public health guidelines. In study 2 (n = 735), we developed a multifaceted intervention designed to realign perceived risk with actual risk. Participants completed an episodic simulation task; we expected that imagining a COVID-related scenario would increase the salience of risk information and enhance behavior change. Immediately following the episodic simulation, participants completed a risk estimation task with individualized feedback about local viral prevalence. We found that information prediction error, a measure of surprise, drove beneficial change in perceived risk and willingness to engage in risky activities. Imagining a COVID-related scenario beforehand enhanced the effect of prediction error on learning. Importantly, our intervention produced lasting effects that persisted after a 1- to 3-wk delay. Overall, we describe a fast and feasible online intervention that effectively changed beliefs and intentions about risky behaviors.","Sinclair, Alyssa H.; Hakimi, Shabnam; Stanley, Matthew L.; Adcock, R.

Patients and Methods This is a retrospective longitudinal study of hospitalized patients who had a nasopharyngeal swab sample on admission that returned positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction between April 4 and June 5, 2020. The cycle threshold (Ct) value was used as a surrogate for the iVL level, with a Ct level ≤36 for elevated iVL, and >36 for low iVL. MCI was defined as having an elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I >99th percentile upper reference limit. Results A total of 270 patients were included. Of these, 171 (63.3%) had an elevated iVL and 88 (32.6%) had MCI. There was no significant difference in the incidence of MCI in patients with low iVL compared to those with elevated iVL (28.3% vs 35.1%, p=0.25). In a multivariable model, MCI (OR: 3.86; 95% CI 1.80-8.34, p<0.001) and elevated iVL (OR: 4.21; 95% CI 2.06-8.61, p<0.001) were independent and incremental predictors of in-hospital mortality. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 iVL level is not associated with increased incidence of MCI, though both parameters are strong independent and incremental predictors of mortality. Understanding the MCI mechanisms MCI allows for early focused interventions to improve survival, especially in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and high iVL.","Chehab, Omar; El Zein, Said; Kanj, Amjad; Moghrabi, Adel; Sebastian, Joseph; Halboni, Adnan; Alkassis, Samer; Hor, Nivine El-; Briasoulis, Alexandros; Lieberman, Randy; Afonso, Luis; Chandrasekar, Pranatharthi; Abidov, Aiden",Mayo Clin Proc Innov Qual Outcomes,454,9

RESULTS: A total of 1231 deaths were included, all of which were previously unsuspicious for SARS-CoV‑2 infection. Thereof 29 cases of previously unknown infections were recorded. In the first phase of the pandemic, incidental findings predominantly occurred among younger people from domestic environments with unclear or unnatural manner of death at the Institute of Legal Medicine. Over time, incidental findings investigated at the crematoria increased, mostly related to nursing home residents. The overall cohort showed no significant sociodemographic differences to a comparative collective of known SARS-CoV‑2-associated deaths. Primarily unreported cases showed a significantly lower proportion of COVID-19 as the underlying cause of death. CONCLUSION: A systematic PCR-based monitoring of deaths allows a more targeted detection and classification of SARS-CoV‑2 positive cases. A preventive contribution can be made by disclosing unreported pandemic-related cases of death.","Klein, Anke; Langenwalder, Felicia; Heinrich, Fabian; Meißner, Kira; Schröder, Ann Sophie; Püschel, Klaus; Ondruschka, Benjamin; Lütgehetmann, Marc; Heinemann, Axel",Rechtsmedizin (Berl),454,1

Unlike other nidoviruses, which include the Coronaviridae, mesoniviruses are restricted to mosquito hosts and do not infect vertebrate cells. To date there is little information on the morphological and antigenic characteristics of this new group of viruses and a dearth of mesonivirus-specific research tools. In this study we determined the genetic relationships of recent Australian isolates of Alphamesonivirus 4 (Casuarina virus—CASV) and Alphamesonivirus 1 (Nam Dinh virus—NDiV), obtained from multiple mosquito species. Australian isolates of NDiV showed high-level similarity to the prototype NDiV isolate from Vietnam (99% nucleotide (nt) and amino acid (aa) identity). Isolates of CASV from Central Queensland were genetically very similar to the prototype virus from Darwin (95–96% nt and 91–92% aa identity). Electron microscopy studies demonstrated that virion diameter (≈80 nm) and spike length (≈10 nm) were similar for both viruses. Monoclonal antibodies specific to CASV and NDiV revealed a close antigenic relationship between the two viruses with 13/34 mAbs recognising both viruses. We also detected NDiV RNA on honey-soaked nucleic acid preservation cards fed on by wild mosquitoes supporting a possible mechanism of horizontal transmission between insects in nature.","Newton, Natalee D.; Colmant, Agathe M.

In patients with severe symptoms of the disease, pneumonia develops due to Covid-19 virus. This causes intense involvement and damage in lungs. Although the emergence of the disease occurred a short time ago, many literature studies have been carried out in which these effects of the disease on the lungs were revealed by the help of lung CT imaging. In this study, 1.396 lung CT images in total (386 Covid-19 and 1.010 Non-Covid-19) were subjected to automatic classification. In this study, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), one of the deep learning methods, was used which suggested automatic classification of CT images of lungs for early diagnosis of Covid-19 disease. In addition, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to compare the classification successes of deep learning with machine learning. Within the scope of the study, a 23-layer CNN architecture was designed and used as a classifier. Also, training and testing processes were performed for Alexnet and Mobilenetv2 CNN architectures as well. The classification results were also calculated for the case of increasing the number of images used in training for the first 23-layer CNN architecture by 5, 10, and 20 times using data augmentation methods. To reveal the effect of the change in the number of images in the training and test clusters on the results, two different training and testing processes, 2-fold and 10-fold cross-validation, were performed and the results of the study were calculated. As a result, thanks to these detailed calculations performed within the scope of the study, a comprehensive comparison of the success of the texture analysis method, machine learning, and deep learning methods in Covid-19 classification from CT images was made. The highest mean sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F-1 score, and AUC values obtained as a result of the study were 0,9197, 0,9891, 0,9473, 0,9058, 0,9888; respectively for 2-fold cross-validation, and they were 0,9404, 0,9901, 0,9599, 0,9284, 0,9903; respectively for 10-fold cross-validation.","Yasar, Huseyin; Ceylan, Murat",Multimed Tools Appl,454,1

Most recent palmprint recognition studies such as deep-learning methods usually learn discriminative features from palmprint images, which usually require a large number of labeled samples to achieve a reasonable good recognition performance. However, palmprint images are usually limited because it is relative difficult to collect enough palmprint samples, making most existing deep-learning-based methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose a heuristic palmprint recognition method by extracting triple types of palmprint features without requiring any training samples. We first extract the most important inherent features of a palmprint, including the texture, gradient and direction features, and encode them into triple-type feature codes. Then, we use the block-wise histograms of the triple-type feature codes to form the triple feature descriptors for palmprint representation. Finally, we employ a weighted matching-score level fusion to calculate the similarity between two compared palmprint images of triple-type feature descriptors for palmprint recognition. Extensive experimental results on the three widely used palmprint databases clearly show the promising effectiveness of the proposed method.","Wu, Lian; Xu, Yong; Cui, Zhongwei; Zuo, Yu; Zhao, Shuping; Fei, Lunke",Sensors (Basel),454,24

Even resourceful countries have failed to adequately prevent epidemics in their country, and for countries like Bangladesh, which already has strained an ineffective healthcare system, the challenges to contain the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus are that much more severe. Due to the scarcity of resources and systematic failures the Bangladeshi people deeply mistrust the healthcare system. The mistrust is further magnified as healthcare providers are hesitant to treat the patients because of the lack of proper protective gear. Physicians have a moral obligation to serve and treat patients; however, they have a moral obligation to protect their families. This dilemma places healthcare providers in situations where they experience moral distress. This article specifically discusses the importance of interpersonal relationships in driving change, using the framework of Responsiveness, while stating the need for complementary systematic change in order to rebuild trust in the Bangladeshi healthcare system.","Hossain, Fahmida",Dev World Bioeth,454,1

In June 2020, during the early phases of COVID-19 vaccines development, we conducted a survey in 885 Italian adults that aimed at assessing their attitudes and opinions about vaccination, in addition to their vaccine literacy levels (i.e., skills in finding, understanding, and using information about vaccines). In January 2021, the same questionnaire was administered to a similar population (n = 160). Interactive vaccine literacy was significantly higher in January 2021 than in June 2020 (mean score 3.38 vs. 3.27 respectively, p = 0.0021). The percentage of participants willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19 assessed by either-or questions, was equally high in both surveys (>90%), which is quite reassuring, although metrics based on categorical scales cannot identify hesitant subjects.","Biasio, Luigi Roberto; Bonaccorsi, Guglielmo; Lorini, Chiara; Mazzini, Daniela; Pecorelli, Sergio",Vaccines (Basel),454,21
