84,84,84,Public health preparedness in Alberta: a systems-level study,21.190609,1.1572577,2006-12-28,"BACKGROUND: Recent international and national events have brought critical attention to the Canadian public health system and how prepared the system is to respond to various types of contemporary public health threats. This article describes the study design and methods being used to conduct a systems-level analysis of public health preparedness in the province of Alberta, Canada. The project is being funded under the Health Research Fund, Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research. METHODS/DESIGN: We use an embedded, multiple-case study design, integrating qualitative and quantitative methods to measure empirically the degree of inter-organizational coordination existing among public health agencies in Alberta, Canada. We situate our measures of inter-organizational network ties within a systems-level framework to assess the relative influence of inter-organizational ties, individual organizational attributes, and institutional environmental features on public health preparedness. The relative contribution of each component is examined for two potential public health threats: pandemic influenza and West Nile virus. DISCUSSION: The organizational dimensions of public health preparedness depend on a complex mix of individual organizational characteristics, inter-agency relationships, and institutional environmental factors. Our study is designed to discriminate among these different system components and assess the independent influence of each on the other, as well as the overall level of public health preparedness in Alberta. While all agree that competent organizations and functioning networks are important components of public health preparedness, this study is one of the first to use formal network analysis to study the role of inter-agency networks in the development of prepared public health systems.","Moore, Douglas; Shiell, Alan; Noseworthy, Tom; Russell, Margaret; Predy, Gerald",BMC Public Health,61,30
194,194,194,Factors influencing psychological distress during a disease epidemic: Data from Australia's first outbreak of equine influenza,21.177158,1.3387455,2008-10-03,"BACKGROUND: In 2007 Australia experienced its first outbreak of highly infectious equine influenza. Government disease control measures were put in place to control, contain, and eradicate the disease; these measures included movement restrictions and quarantining of properties. This study was conducted to assess the psycho-social impacts of this disease, and this paper reports the prevalence of, and factors influencing, psychological distress during this outbreak. METHODS: Data were collected using an online survey, with a link directed to the affected population via a number of industry groups. Psychological distress, as determined by the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale, was the main outcome measure. RESULTS: In total, 2760 people participated in this study. Extremely high levels of non-specific psychological distress were reported by respondents in this study, with 34% reporting high psychological distress (K10 > 22), compared to levels of around 12% in the Australian general population. Analysis, using backward stepwise binary logistic regression analysis, revealed that those living in high risk infection (red) zones (OR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.57–2.55; p < 0.001) and disease buffer (amber) zones (OR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.36–2.46; p < 0.001) were at much greater risk of high psychological distress than those living in uninfected (white zones). Although prevalence of high psychological distress was greater in infected EI zones and States, elevated levels of psychological distress were experienced in horse-owners nationally. Statistical analysis indicated that certain groups were more vulnerable to high psychological distress; specifically younger people, and those with lower levels of formal educational qualifications. Respondents whose principal source of income was from horse-related industry were more than twice as likely to have high psychological distress than those whose primary source of income was not linked to horse-related industry (OR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.82–2.73; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although, methodologically, this study had good internal validity, it has limited generalisability because it was not possible to identify, bound, or sample the target population accurately. However, this study is the first to collect psychological distress data from an affected population during such a disease outbreak and has potential to inform those involved in assessing the potential psychological impacts of human infectious diseases, such as pandemic influenza.","Taylor, Melanie R; Agho, Kingsley E; Stevens, Garry J; Raphael, Beverley",BMC Public Health,61,30
691,691,691,Missing and accounted for: gaps and areas of wealth in the public health review literature,21.109,1.0159507,2011-10-03,"BACKGROUND: High-quality review evidence is useful for informing and influencing public health policy and practice decisions. However, certain topic areas lack representation in terms of the quantity and quality of review literature available. The objectives of this paper are to identify the quantity, as well as quality, of review-level evidence available on the effectiveness of public health interventions for public health decision makers. METHODS: Searches conducted on http://www.health-evidence.ca produced an inventory of public health review literature in 21 topic areas. Gaps and areas of wealth in the review literature, as well as the proportion of reviews rated methodologically strong, moderate, or weak were identified. The top 10 topic areas of interest for registered users and visitors of http://www.health-evidence.ca were extracted from user profile data and Google Analytics. RESULTS: Registered users' top three interests included: 1) healthy communities, 2) chronic diseases, and 3) nutrition. The top three preferences for visitors included: 1) chronic diseases, 2) physical activity, and 3) addiction/substance use. All of the topic areas with many (301+) available reviews were of interest to registered users and/or visitors (mental health, physical activity, addiction/substance use, adolescent health, child health, nutrition, adult health, and chronic diseases). Conversely, the majority of registered users and/or visitors did not have preference for topic areas with few (≤ 150) available reviews (food safety and inspection, dental health, environmental health) with the exception of social determinants of health and healthy communities. Across registered users' and visitors' topic areas of preference, 80.2% of the reviews were of well-done methodological quality, with 43.5% of reviews having a strong quality rating and 36.7% a moderate review quality rating. CONCLUSIONS: In topic areas in which many reviews are available, higher level syntheses are needed to guide policy and practice. For other topic areas with few reviews, it is necessary to determine whether primary study evidence exists, or is needed, so that reviews can be conducted in the future. Considering that less than half of the reviews available on http://www.health-evidence.ca are of strong methodological quality, the quality of the review-level evidence needs to improve across the range of public health topic areas.","Tirilis, Daiva; Husson, Heather; DeCorby, Kara; Dobbins, Maureen",BMC Public Health,61,30
1647,1647,1647,A systematic review of barriers to data sharing in public health,21.075916,1.3205627,2014-11-05,"BACKGROUND: In the current information age, the use of data has become essential for decision making in public health at the local, national, and global level. Despite a global commitment to the use and sharing of public health data, this can be challenging in reality. No systematic framework or global operational guidelines have been created for data sharing in public health. Barriers at different levels have limited data sharing but have only been anecdotally discussed or in the context of specific case studies. Incomplete systematic evidence on the scope and variety of these barriers has limited opportunities to maximize the value and use of public health data for science and policy. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review of potential barriers to public health data sharing. Documents that described barriers to sharing of routinely collected public health data were eligible for inclusion and reviewed independently by a team of experts. We grouped identified barriers in a taxonomy for a focused international dialogue on solutions. RESULTS: Twenty potential barriers were identified and classified in six categories: technical, motivational, economic, political, legal and ethical. The first three categories are deeply rooted in well-known challenges of health information systems for which structural solutions have yet to be found; the last three have solutions that lie in an international dialogue aimed at generating consensus on policies and instruments for data sharing. CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous effect of multiple interacting barriers ranging from technical to intangible issues has greatly complicated advances in public health data sharing. A systematic framework of barriers to data sharing in public health will be essential to accelerate the use of valuable information for the global good.

Plasma phosphatidylcholine (PC), the major phospholipid of circulating lipoproteins, is synthesized in human liver by two biologically diverse pathways: the cytidine diphosphocholine (CDP):choline and phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) pathways. Here, we used ESI-MS/MS both to characterize plasma PC compositions and to quantify metabolic fluxes of both pathways using stable isotopes in patients with severe ARDS and in healthy controls. Direct incorporation of methyl-D(9)-choline estimated CDP:choline pathway flux, while PEMT flux was determined from incorporations of one and two methyl-D(3) groups derived from methyl-D(9)-choline. The results of MS/MS analysis showed significant alterations in plasma PC composition in patients with ARDS versus healthy controls. In particular, the increased overall methyl-D(9)-PC enrichment and, most importantly, the much lower methyl-D(3)-PC and methyl-D(6)-PC enrichments suggest increased flux through the CDP:choline pathway and reduced flux through the PEMT pathway in ARDS. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate significant plasma PC molecular compositional changes combined with associated alterations in the dynamics of PC synthetic pathways in patients with ARDS.","Dushianthan, Ahilanandan; Cusack, Rebecca; Grocott, Michael P.

It is difficult to generalize machine learning brain markers to the data acquired from independent imaging sites, mainly due to large site differences in functional magnetic resonance imaging. We address the difficulty of finding a generalizable marker of major depressive disorder (MDD) that would distinguish patients from healthy controls based on resting-state functional connectivity patterns. For the discovery dataset with 713 participants from 4 imaging sites, we removed site differences using our recently developed harmonization method and developed a machine learning MDD classifier. The classifier achieved an approximately 70% generalization accuracy for an independent validation dataset with 521 participants from 5 different imaging sites. The successful generalization to a perfectly independent dataset acquired from multiple imaging sites is novel and ensures scientific reproducibility and clinical applicability.","Yamashita, Ayumu; Sakai, Yuki; Yamada, Takashi; Yahata, Noriaki; Kunimatsu, Akira; Okada, Naohiro; Itahashi, Takashi; Hashimoto, Ryuichiro; Mizuta, Hiroto; Ichikawa, Naho; Takamura, Masahiro; Okada, Go; Yamagata, Hirotaka; Harada, Kenichiro; Matsuo, Koji; Tanaka, Saori C.; Kawato, Mitsuo; Kasai, Kiyoto; Kato, Nobumasa; Takahashi, Hidehiko; Okamoto, Yasumasa; Yamashita, Okito; Imamizu, Hiroshi",PLoS Biol,61,30

Various applications, often based on virtual reality, have been implemented to carry out psychological assessments and interventions, using innovative human–machine interaction systems. In this context, the LEAP Motion sensing technology has raised interest, since it allows for more natural interactions with digital contents, via an optical tracking of hand and finger movements. Recent research has considered LEAP Motion features in virtual-reality-based systems, to meet specific needs of different clinical populations, varying in age and type of disorder. The present paper carried out a systematic mini-review of the available literature using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The inclusion criteria were (i) publication date between 2013 and 2020, (ii) being an empirical study or project report, (iii) written in English or Italian languages, (iv) published in a scholarly peer-reviewed journal and/or conference proceedings, and (v) assessing LEAP Motion intervention for four specific psychological domains (i.e., autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, dementia, and mild cognitive impairment), objectively. Nineteen eligible empirical studies were included. Overall, results show that protocols for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder can promote psychomotor and psychosocial rehabilitation in contexts that stimulate learning. Moreover, virtual reality and LEAP Motion seem promising for the assessment and screening of functional abilities in dementia and mild cognitive impairment. As evidence is, however, still limited, deeper investigations are needed to assess the full potential of the LEAP Motion technology, possibly extending its applications. This is relevant, considering the role that virtual reality could have in overcoming barriers to access assessment, therapies, and smart monitoring.","Colombini, Giulia; Duradoni, Mirko; Carpi, Federico; Vagnoli, Laura; Guazzini, Andrea",Int J Environ Res Public Health,61,30

Emergency and concomitant surgeries are significant risk factors of mortality following open-heart surgery in patients on hemodialysis. CASE PRESENTATION: We report two cases of successful coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients on dialysis with a history of cardiac surgery. The first case describes a 65-year-old woman who had undergone aortic valve replacement 2 years ago and was hospitalized urgently, because of a sudden decline in heart function and hypotension. She had moderate mitral regurgitation with right ventricular pressure of 66 mmHg and poor left ventricular function [left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), 40%]. Cineangiography revealed an increase in the rate of stenosis in the left main trunk, from 25 to 99% at admission, in addition to 100% occlusion in proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) and 99% stenosis in the proximal left circumflex artery (LCX). We inserted an intra-aortic balloon pump preoperatively and performed emergency surgery (Euro II risk score, 61.7%; Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) risk score, 56.3%). The second case described a 78-year-old man who had undergone surgery for left atrial myxoma 4 years ago and was hospitalized urgently due to dyspnea, chest discomfort, and an LVEF of 44% (Euro II risk score, 40.7%; STS risk score, 33.2%). Cineangiography revealed an increase in the rate of stenosis in the proximal LAD, from 25% (4 years ago) to 90% at admission, in addition to 99% stenosis in proximal LCX and 95% stenosis in the posterolateral branch of LCX. Both patients underwent emergency CABG due to unstable hemodynamics and decreased left ventricular function despite regular dialysis. The surgeries were successful, and the patients were discharged without any complications. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with multiple comorbidities and those who undergo dialysis treatment, calcified lesions in coronary arteries can progress severely and rapidly without any symptoms, including chest pain. Close outpatient management involving nephrologists and the cardiovascular team is necessary for patients on dialysis.","Yamaoka, Hironobu; Yamamoto, Taira; Endo, Daisuke; Shimada, Akie; Matsushita, Satoshi; Asai, Tohru; Amano, Atsushi",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,61,30

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a pre- and post-surgical pelvic floor rehabilitation program on the bowel symptoms, pelvic floor function, and quality of life of rectal cancer patients. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial with parallel groups (pelvic floor rehabilitation versus control group), with a blinded evaluator. Participants and setting: 56 stage I to III rectal cancer patients aged from 18 to 80 years old undergoing sphincter preservation surgery at Hospital del Salvador and who have a sufficient knowledge of Spanish. Main outcome measures: ICIQ-B questionnaire for intestinal symptoms, high-resolution anorectal manometry (Alacer Multiplex 24-channel manometry equipment) for anorectal function, pelvic floor muscle strength test with Oxford Modified Scale, and a quality of life test with the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire. The evaluations will be carried out at five stages: before surgery, before and after the pelvic floor rehabilitation, and during a 3-month and 1-year follow-up. Interventions: one pre-rehabilitation session and 9 to 12 sessions of pelvic floor rehabilitation, including patient education, pelvic floor muscle exercises, pelvic floor electromyography biofeedback, and capacitive and sensory rectal training with a balloon probe. Rehabilitation will begin 3–5 weeks before the ileostomy is removed (four sessions) and around 3 weeks after stoma removal (5–8 sessions).

Cell-based sensors have emerged as promising platforms to screen targets in biologically relevant environments. However, there are few examples where cell-based sensors have been practically applied for drug screening. Here, we used engineered cortisol-detecting sensor cells to screen for natural mimetics of cortisol. The sensor cells were designed to report the presence of a target through signal peptide activation and subsequent fluorescence signal translocation. The developed sensor cells were able to detect known biological targets from human-derived analytes as well as natural product extracts, such as deer antlers and ginseng. The multi-use capability and versatility to screen in different cellular environments were also demonstrated. The sensor cells were used to identify novel GR effectors from medicinal plant extracts. Our results suggest that decursin from dongquai had the GR effector function as a selective GR agonist (SEGRA), making it a potent drug candidate with anti-inflammatory activity. We demonstrated the superiority of cell-based sensing technology over in vitro screening, proving its potential for practical drug screening applications that leads to the function-based discovery of target molecules.","Kang, Chungwon; Kim, Soyoun; Lee, Euiyeon; Ryu, Jeahee; Lee, Minhyeong; Kwon, Youngeun",Biosensors (Basel),61,30

The studies were conducted with the laser correlation spectroscopy and optical analysis of dehydrated films. It was shown that the addition of magnetite to an albumin solution at low concentrations of up to 10(−6) g/L led to the formation of aggregates with sizes of up to 300 nm in the liquid phase and an increase in the number of spiral structures in the dehydrated films, which indicated an increase in their stability. With a further increase in the magnetite concentration in the solution (from 10(−4) g/L), the magnetic particles stuck together and to albumin, thus forming aggregates with sizes larger than 1000 nm. At the same time, the formation of morphological structures in molecular films was disturbed, and a characteristic decrease in their stability occurred. Most stable films were formed at low concentrations of magnetic nanoparticles (less than 10(−4) g/L) when small albumin–magnetic nanoparticle aggregates were formed. These results are important for characterizing the interaction processes of biomolecules with magnetic nanoparticles and can be useful for predicting the stability of biomolecular films with the inclusion of magnetite particles.","Velichko, Elena N.; Nepomnyashchaya, Elina K.; Baranov, Maksim A.; Skvortsov, Alexey N.; Pleshakov, Ivan V.; Dong, Ge",Int J Mol Sci,61,5

Here, we demonstrate that BAdV-3 pV, expressed as 55 kDa protein, localizes to the nucleus and specifically targets nucleolus of the infected cells. Analysis of deletion mutants of pV suggested that amino acids 81–120, 190–210, and 380–389 act as multiple nuclear localization signals (NLS), which also appear to serve as the binding sites for importin α-3 protein, a member of the importin α/β nuclear import receptor pathway. Moreover, pV amino acids 21–50 and 380–389 appear to act as nucleolar localization signals (NoLs). Interestingly, amino acids 380–389 appear to act both as NLS and as NoLS. The presence of NoLS is essential for the production of infectious progeny virions, as deletion of both NoLs are lethal for the production of infectious BAdV-3. Analysis of mutant BAV.pVd1d3 (isolated in pV completing CRL cells) containing deletion/mutation of both NoLS in non-complementing CRL cells not only revealed the altered intracellular localization of mutant pV but also reduced the expression of some late proteins. However, it does not appear to affect the incorporation of viral proteins, including mutant pV, in BAV.pVd1d3 virions. Further analysis of CsCl purified BAV.pVd1d3 suggested the presence of thermo-labile virions with disrupted capsids, which appear to affect the infectivity of the progeny virions. Our results suggest that pV contains overlapping and non-overlapping NoLS/NLS.

We hypothesis that COVID-19 quarantine affected child mental health, and that paternal stress or support, and child physical environment including household space, colors, sunlight exposure, and natural views, impacted child mental wellbeing in the quarantine. To assess the effect of quarantine on a child’s mental health, an online survey was administered globally through scientific organizations and social media. Those over 18 years old, and guardians of children were asked to participate in the survey. The survey was filled by 114 guardians from 31 countries. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. Most participants experienced stress in the quarantine and reported child anxiety symptoms including focus reduction, sleeping difficulties, and appetite changes. Family fun activities and encouraging words, were mostly successful in reducing child anxiety. Reporting anxiety symptoms in children were more common in parents who had mental hardships compared to those who did not experience mental problems or had an improved mental status. Physical environment assessment showed that households with bright walls associated with fewer reports of child mental problems compared to households with neutral wall colors, and that most guardians thought that their children’s living space was not sufficient to play and study.

Favorable 12-month safety and ablation precision were previously described. MATERIALS AND METHODS As a mandated safety criterion, TULSA was delivered as near whole-gland ablation, applying 3-mm margins sparing 10% of peripheral prostate tissue. After 12-month biopsy and MRI, biannual follow-up included prostate-specific antigen (PSA), adverse events, and functional quality of life assessment, with repeat systematic biopsy at three years. RESULTS Three-year follow-up was completed by 22 patients. Between one and three years, there were no new serious or severe adverse events. Urinary and bowel function remained stable. Erectile function recovered by one year, stable at three years. PSA decreased 95% to median (IQR) nadir of 0.33 (0.1-0.4)ng/ml, stable to 0.8 (0.4-1.6)ng/ml at three years. Serial biopsies identified clinically significant disease in 10/29 men (34%), any cancer in 17/29 (59%). By three years, seven men had recurrence (four histological, three biochemical) and had undergone salvage therapy without complications (including six prostatectomy). At three years, 3/22 men refused biopsy, and 2/22 (9%) had clinically significant disease (one new, one persistent). Predictors of salvage therapy requirement included less extensive ablation coverage and higher PSA nadir. CONCLUSION With three-year Phase I follow-up, TULSA demonstrates safe and precise ablation for men with localized prostate cancer, providing predictable PSA and biopsy outcomes, without affecting functional abilities or precluding salvage therapy.","Nair, Shiva M; Hatiboglu, Gencay; Relle, James; Hetou, Khalil; Hafron, Jason; Harle, Christopher; Kassam, Zahra; Staruch, Robert; Burtnyk, Mathieu; Bonekamp, David; Schlemmer, Heinz-Peter; Roethke, Matthias C; Mueller-Wolf, Maya; Pahernik, Sascha; Chin, Joseph L",BJU international,61,16

Most published papers deal with surgical treatment. We report our experience with a new interventional management, endobronchial naso-bronchial lavage (ENBL). The aim of this study was to evaluate the continuing efficacy and safety of this innovative procedure. PATIENTS AND METHODS From 2002 to 2012, 17 patients who suffered from post-lobectomy bronchopleural fistula were recruited. An ENBL tube was inserted form nostril through the trachea, bronchus and the fistula into the pleural cavity with bronchoscope. Lavage of the pleural cavity was proceeded form the ENBL tube and drained form thoracostomy drainage tube. All patients were followed up for at least 6 months. RESULT All patients received total recovery from the post-lobectomy bronchopleural fistula. The ENBL procedure could be finished in 10-15 min. No blooding without control, pneumonia or damage of trachea associated with this procedure occurred. With an at least 6 months' follow-up of the patients, no further intervention was performed. CONCLUSIONS It suggested that the ENBL may be an alternative interventional treatment for bronchopleural fistula treating other than surgical procedure.","Ning, Ye; Huang, Hai; Xue, Lei; Zhao, Xuewei",World journal of surgery,61,3

Researchers in different fields have been working on finding explanations for the unequal impact of the virus and deaths from the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across geographical areas. Demographers and other social scientists have hinted at the importance of demographic factors, such as age structure and intergenerational relationships. Our aim is to reflect on the possible link between intergenerational relationships and spread and lethality of COVID-19 in a critical way. We show that with available aggregate data it is not possible to draw robust evidence to support these links. In fact, despite a higher prevalence of intergenerational coresidence and contacts that is broadly positively associated with COVID-19 case fatality rates at the country level, the opposite is generally true at the subnational level. While this inconsistent evidence demonstrates neither the existence nor the absence of a causal link between intergenerational relationships and the severity of COVID-19, we warn against simplistic interpretations of the available data, which suffer from many shortcomings. We conclude by arguing that intergenerational relationships are not only about physical contacts between family members. Theoretically, different forms of intergenerational relationships may have causal effects of opposite sign on the diffusion of COVID-19. Policies should also take into account that intergenerational ties are a source of instrumental and emotional support, which may favor compliance to the lockdown and ""phase-2"" restrictions and may buffer their negative consequences on mental health.","Arpino, Bruno; Bordone, Valeria; Pasqualini, Marta",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,61,1

However, all the published clinical trials involve oral administration of the drug, although the disease is primarily a respiratory one. Direct inhaled delivery could reduce the side effects associated with oral use and ensure a high concentration of the drug in the lungs. In this study, inhalable HCQ powders were prepared and characterized for potential COVID-19 therapy. Methods: Hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ-sul) was jet milled (JM) followed by conditioning by storage at different relative humidities (43%, 53%, 58%, and 75% RHs) for 7 days. The solid-state properties, including particle morphology and size distribution, crystallinity, and vapor moisture profiles of HCQ-sul samples, were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, laser diffraction, X-ray powder diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and dynamic water vapor sorption. The aerosol performance of the HCQ-sul powders was assessed using a medium-high resistance Osmohaler coupling to a next-generation impactor (NGI) at a flow rate of 60 L/min. Results: The jet-milled powder showed a volume median diameter of 1.7 μm (span 1.5) and retained the same crystalline form as the raw HCQ-sul. A small amount of amorphous materials was present in the jet-milled HCQ-sul, which was convertible to the stable, crystalline state after conditioning at 53%, 58%, and 75% RH. The recovered fine particle fraction (FPF)recovered and the emitted fine particle fraction (FPFemitted) of the HCQ-sul sample immediately after jet milling and the samples after conditioning at 43%, 53%, and 58% RH were similar at ∼43% and 61%, respectively. In contrast, the sample having conditioned at 75%RH showed lower corresponding values at 33% and 26% respectively, due to the formation of solid bridges caused by excessive moisture. Conclusion: Inhalable crystalline powders of HCQ-sul were successfully prepared, which can be used for clinical testing as a potential inhaled COVID-19 treatment.","Albariqi, Ahmed H; Chang, Rachel Yoon Kyung; Tai, Waiting; Ke, Wei-Ren; Chow, Michael Y T; Tang, Patricia; Kwok, Philip Chi Lip; Chan, Hak-Kim",Journal of aerosol medicine and pulmonary drug delivery,61,1

This review provides an overview of the underlying immune profile of COVID-19-related CRS as well as laboratory markers for acute diagnosis and chronic follow-up of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and CRS. Areas covered: Innate and acquired immune profiles in COVID-19-CRS, RNA-detection methods for SARS-CoV-2 in the setting of CRS including factors that affect assay performance, serology for SARS-CoV-2 in the setting of CRS, and other biomarkers for COVID-19 will be discussed. Expert opinion: Studies support the implication of CRS in the pathogenesis, clinical severity and outcome of COVID-19 through the elevated production of multiple inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from activated innate and adaptive immune cells. Although these inflammatory molecules, including IL-6, IL-2R, IL-10, IP-10 and MCP-1, often correlate with disease severity as the possible biomarkers, the pathogenic contributions of individual molecules and the therapeutic benefits of targeting them are yet to be demonstrated. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is the gold standard method for diagnosis of COVID-19 in the context of CRS but assay performance varies and is susceptible to false negative results even as patients clinically deteriorate due to decreased viral shedding in the setting of CRS. Biomarkers including CRP, ferritin, D-dimer and procalcitonin may provide early clues about progression to CRS and help identify thrombotic and infectious complications of COVID-19.","Azar, Marwan M; Shin, Junghee J; Kang, Insoo; Landry, Marie",Expert review of molecular diagnostics,61,4

Although regional morphological differences between these cell types were initially described after their identification a century ago, these differences were largely ignored. Recently, accumulating evidence suggests that macroglial cells form distinct populations throughout the CNS, based on both functional and morphological features. Moreover, with the use of refined techniques including single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing, additional evidence is emerging for regional macroglial heterogeneity at the transcriptional level. In parallel, several studies revealed the existence of regional differences in remyelination capacity between CNS grey and white matter areas, both in experimental models for successful remyelination as well as in the chronic demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS). In this review, we provide an overview of the diversity in oligodendroglial lineage cells and astrocytes from the grey and white matter, as well as their interplay in health and upon demyelination and successful remyelination. In addition, we discuss the implications of regional macroglial diversity for remyelination in light of its failure in MS. Since the etiology of MS remains unknown and only disease-modifying treatments altering the immune response are available for MS, the elucidation of macroglial diversity in grey and white matter and its putative contribution to the observed difference in remyelination efficiency between these regions may open therapeutic avenues aimed at enhancing endogenous remyelination in either area.","Werkman, Inge L; Lentferink, Dennis H; Baron, Wia",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,61,1

We recently performed a modified de novo insertion technique for catheter replacement in our practice. As the technique has not yet been studied comprehensively, we performed a retrospective study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of de novo placed catheter without delay for catheter replacement in elderly hemodialysis patients. METHODS A retrospective review of 164 elderly patients was conducted during a period of three years. There were 84 patients in study group, as well as 80 patients in a control group, who had catheter replacement by guidewire exchange technique. Clinical follow-up data was collected. RESULTS All catheters were placed successfully. The mean survival time per catheter was 641 catheter days (study group) and 485 catheter days (control group). The primary patency rates of 30 days were 97.7% (study group) and 90% (control group), respectively, with statistically significant difference (p = 0.04). The incidence of catheter infection was not statistically significantly different in both groups (p = 0.586), but the case of catheter dysfunction was significantly lower in study group compared to control group (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS The de novo placed catheter without delay technique for catheter replacement near the pre-existing venotomy site is safe, and boasts similar infection rates with lower dysfunction rates compared to tunneled catheter insertion by guidewire exchange technique.","Wang, Lihua; Wei, Fang; Chen, Haiyan; Sun, Guijiang; Yu, Haibo; Jiang, Aili",The journal of vascular access,61,28

The triggers of asthma exacerbations include allergens and infections -mostly viral-. The objective of this study was to establish the relationship between viruses detected during an asthma exacerbation and eosinophil and serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels in pediatric patients. POPULATION AND METHODS Cross-sectional. analytical study. Children aged 5-15 years seen at the Pediatric Emergency Department with an asthma exacerbation in the period between March 2013 and February 2016 were included. Viral ribonucleic acid was extracted from nasopharyngeal aspirates using the CLART Pneumo Vir kit. Eosinophil levels were measured in peripheral blood and total IgE levels, in serum. Eosinophilia was defined as a count ≥ 0.4 x 103/ mm3 and high IgE. as a level ≥ 350 IU/L. The Pearson's correlation was carried out. A value of p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS Out of 211 children with asthma exacerbation, a virus was isolated in 20%. The most commonly isolated viruses were rhinovirus. enterovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus. A correlation of 0.89 was established between eosinophil and total serum IgE levels in children with asthma exacerbation and rhinovirus, with a p value of 0.0001. CONCLUSIONS Rhinovirus, enterovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were the most common viruses in asthma exacerbations in children younger than 15 years.

We performed a literature review aiming to identify the prognostic value of alterations of cardiac biomarkers in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cardiac biomarkers are significantly elevated in patients with severe COVID-19 and are independent predictors of mortality. High-sensitivity troponin I and T are correlated with multiple inflammatory indexes and poor outcomes. Although cut-off values have been established for most of cardiac biomarkers, lower limits for troponins may have better prognostic values and longitudinal monitoring of cardiac biomarkers can help the clinician assess the patient's course.

There may be factors that commonly facilitate or inhibit the desired outcomes of QI curricula in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education. The purpose of this review was to synthesise attributes of QI curricula in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education associated with curricular outcomes. METHODS A realist synthesis of peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted to identify the common contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes of QI curricula in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education in order to develop a programme theory to articulate what works, for whom, and in what contexts. RESULTS 18854 records underwent title and abstract screening, full texts of 609 records were appraised for eligibility, data were extracted from 358 studies, and 218 studies were included in the development and refinement of the final programme theory. Contexts included curricular strategies, levels of training, clinical settings, and organisational culture. Mechanisms were identified within the overall QI curricula itself (eg, clear expectations and deliverables, and protected time), in the didactic components (ie, content delivery strategies), and within the experiential components (eg, topic selection strategies, working with others, and mentorship). Mechanisms were often associated with certain contexts to promote educational and clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION This research describes the various pedagogical strategies for teaching QI to medical learners and highlights the contexts and mechanisms that could potentially account for differences in educational and clinical outcomes of QI curricula. Educators may benefit from considering these contexts and mechanisms in the design and implementation of QI curricula to optimise the outcomes of training in this competency area.","Brown, Allison; Lafreniere, Kyle; Freedman, David; Nidumolu, Aditya; Mancuso, Matthew; Hecker, Kent; Kassam, Aliya",BMJ quality & safety,61,1

Asymmetries in angle and speed when changing direction off the operated and nonoperated limbs after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction may therefore influence the interpretation of interlimb differences in joint-level biomechanical parameters. The authors hypothesized that athletes would reduce center-of-mass heading angle deflection and body rotation during the change-of-direction stance phase when cutting from the operated limb, and would compensate for this by orienting their center-of-mass trajectory more toward the new intended direction of travel prior to touchdown. A total of 144 male athletes 8 to 10 months after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction performed a maximum-effort sidestep cutting maneuver while kinematic, kinetic, and ground reaction force data were recorded. Peak ground reaction force and knee joint moments were lower when cutting from the operated limb. Center-of-mass heading angle deflection during stance phase was reduced for cuts performed from the operated limb and was negatively correlated with heading angle at touchdown. Between-limb differences in body orientation and horizontal velocity at touchdown were also observed. These systematic asymmetries in cut execution may require consideration when interpreting joint-level interlimb asymmetries after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and are suggestive of the use of anticipatory control to co-optimize task achievement and mechanical loading.","Daniels, Katherine A J; Drake, Eleanor; King, Enda; Strike, Siobhán",Journal of applied biomechanics,61,27

Here, we have uncovered an immunosuppressive role for nonclassical Ly6Clo monocytes that mediates resistance to anti-VEGFR2 treatment. We found that the chemokine CX3CL1 was upregulated in both human and murine tumors following VEGF signaling blockade, resulting in recruitment of CX3CR1+Ly6Clo monocytes into the tumor. We also found that treatment with VEGFA reduced expression of CX3CL1 in endothelial cells in vitro. Intravital microscopy revealed that CX3CR1 is critical for Ly6Clo monocyte transmigration across the endothelium in murine CRC tumors. Moreover, Ly6Clo monocytes recruit Ly6G+ neutrophils via CXCL5 and produce IL-10, which inhibits adaptive immunity. Preventing Ly6Clo monocyte or Ly6G+ neutrophil infiltration into tumors enhanced inhibition of tumor growth with anti-VEGFR2 therapy. Furthermore, a gene therapy using a nanoparticle formulated with an siRNA against CX3CL1 reduced Ly6Clo monocyte recruitment and improved outcome of anti-VEGFR2 therapy in mouse CRCs. Our study unveils an immunosuppressive function of Ly6Clo monocytes that, to our knowledge, has yet to be reported in any context. We also reveal molecular mechanisms underlying antiangiogenic treatment resistance, suggesting potential immunomodulatory strategies to enhance the long-term clinical outcome of anti-VEGF therapies.","Jung, Keehoon; Heishi, Takahiro; Khan, Omar F; Kowalski, Piotr S; Incio, Joao; Rahbari, Nuh N; Chung, Euiheon; Clark, Jeffrey W; Willett, Christopher G; Luster, Andrew D; Yun, Seok Hyun; Langer, Robert; Anderson, Daniel G; Padera, Timothy P; Jain, Rakesh K; Fukumura, Dai",The Journal of clinical investigation,61,1

The basis of suspicion was clinico-eco-epidemiologic-radiological findings as, by that time, about 20 COVID19 cases were reported from the state of Rajasthan including a big Italian group of tourists who travelled extensively in Rajasthan, including Udaipur city. Objectives The current study presents the field experience of the Central and the State Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) in the cluster containment at Bhilwara. Methods: The information regarding the sociodemographic profile of the cases was provided by the Senior Medical Officer In-charge. The containment strategy was modeled under 6 pillars. Google Maps was used for preparing spot map. Results Immediate public health actions of cluster containment including contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation were initiated using epidemiological approach of mapping the cluster and taking care of reservoir of infection by the District Public Health Team supported by Multidisciplinary Rapid Response Team. This was supplemented by strict enforcement of lock down in the District taking care of daily need of the community by the leadership of administration with very strong intersectoral co-ordination (locally called ""ruthless containment""). Conclusion The forthcoming challenge resides in re-establishment of inter-district and inter-state travel, which can become a risk of re-entry of the new cases, which needs to be taken care of, with the help of stringent administrative measures and screening at all points of entry. The team in Bhilwara needs to remain vigilant to pick up any imported cases early before local transmission establishes.","Meghwal, Badrilal; Behera, Shyambhavee; Dhariwal, Akshay C; Saxena, Deepak; Singh, Rommel; Kumar, Sanjiv",Indian journal of public health,61,19

Early prevention of fractures has become essential in recent decades. This can be achieved by evaluating the related risk factors, as a reference for further intervention. This is especially useful for the vulnerable patient group with comorbidities. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a major complication of liver cirrhosis, may increase the rate of falls and weaken the bone. This study evaluated the correlation between hepatic encephalopathy and osteoporotic hip fracture in the aged population using a national database. METHODS This retrospective cohort study used data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database between 2000 and 2012. We included people who were older than 50 years with hepatic encephalopathy or other common chronic illnesses. Patients with and without hepatic encephalopathy were matched at a ratio of 1:4 for age, sex, and index year. The incidence and hazard ratios of osteoporotic hip fracture between the both cohorts were calculated using Cox proportional hazard regression models. RESULTS The mean age of the enrolled patients was 66.5 years. The incidence ratio of osteoporotic hip fracture in the HE group was significantly higher than that in the non-HE group (68/2496 [2.7%] vs 98/9984 [0.98%]). Patients with HE were 2.15-times more likely to develop osteoporotic hip fractures than patients without HE in the whole group. The risk ratio was also significantly higher in female and older individuals. The results were also similar in the comorbidity subgroups of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, senile cataract, gastric ulcer, and depression. Alcohol-related illnesses seemed to not confound the results of this study. CONCLUSIONS HE is significantly associated with an increased risk of osteoporotic hip fractures, and the significance is not affected by the comorbidities in people aged more than 50 years. The cumulative risk of fracture increases with age.","Yeh, Kuang-Ting; Yu, Tzai-Chiu; Lee, Ru-Ping; Wang, Jen-Hung; Liu, Kuan-Lin; Peng, Cheng-Huan; Chen, Hao-Wen; Chen, Ing-Ho; Hsu, Chung-Yi; Wu, Wen-Tien",BMC musculoskeletal disorders,61,1

The aim of this study was to determine rates of change in BMD over time in people living with HIV (PLWH) treated with DTG. Design The SCOLTA project is a multicenter observational study enrolling HIV-infected people who start newly commercialized drugs prospectively, with the aim of identifying toxicities and adverse events (AE) in a real-life setting. Methods Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at the femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine (LS) was performed at study entry (baseline, BL) and after 96 weeks. Percentage BMD change from BL was evaluated using a general linear model, including factors potentially associated with bone loss. Results One hundred and sixty PLWH were enrolled (26.3% female, mean age 49.9 ± 11.2 years) from April 2015 to April 2017. Overall, we could calculate BMD change from baseline, for at least one site, in 133 subjects (83.1%). After a median of 102 weeks (IQR: 90-110), mean FN BMD increased, but not significantly, whereas LS BMD showed a significant mean increase of 13.1 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.7-24.6) mg/cm3 (+1.6%, 95% CI: 0.3%, 2.8%) after a median time of 102 weeks (IQR: 84-110). As regards LS BMD, patients with osteopenia/osteoporosis at study entry experienced a high increase from baseline (20.6, 95% CI: 3.1, 38.1 mg/cm3), as well as experienced subjects (16.9, 95% CI: 4.7, 29.2 mg/cm3) and those on vitamin D supplementation (26.8, 95% CI: 7.7, 45.9 mg/cm3). Conclusion Dolutegravir-containing regimens could reduce the negative impact of antiretroviral therapy on bone, especially in patients with low BMD.","Bonfanti, Paolo; De Vito, Andrea; Ricci, Elena; Menzaghi, Barbara; Orofino, Giancarlo; Squillace, Nicola; Molteni, Chiara; De Socio, Giuseppe Vittorio; Salomoni, Elena; Celesia, Benedetto Maurizio; Dentone, Chiara; Colombo, Valeria; Madeddu, Giordano",Infection and drug resistance,61,30

Systematic reviews highlight the efficacy of diet and exercise interventions in decreasing T2D risk; however, no review to date provides clear information regarding intervention details (eg, what is delivered, by whom, to whom, when, and mode of delivery). This paper outlines the protocol for a scoping review summarising intervention characteristics of diet and exercise programmes for individuals at risk for T2D. From the included studies and through the use of the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR), the scoping review that results from this protocol paper will provide a narrative analysis of how diabetes prevention programmes are being reported and implemented. METHODS A comprehensive search strategy is outlined to identify studies within Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE and SPORTDiscus. The search strategy will include terms relating to diet and exercise interventions and diabetes risk. To determine eligible studies, predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria will be used independently by two review authors. To be included, studies must be delivering a diet and/or exercise intervention among adults who have been identified as at risk for developing T2D with an outcome related to diabetes prevention. Data extraction of those studies that meet inclusion criteria will be guided by the TIDieR). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval is not required as this review will be using previously collected data. Review findings will be presented at scientific conferences and published in a peer-reviewed journal.","MacPherson, Megan; Cranston, Kaela; Locke, Sean; Vis-Dunbar, Mathew; Jung, Mary E",BMJ open,61,28

Six electronic databases were searched from inception to October 2016. Only randomized controlled trials of interventions (≥12 weeks) in adults with overweight and obesity were included. Five studies were included in this review. Weekly intermittent energy restriction periods ranged from an energy intake between 1757 and 6276 kJ/d-1 . The mean duration of the interventions was 26 (range 14 to 48) weeks. Meta-analysis demonstrated no significant difference in weight loss between weekly intermittent energy restriction and continuous energy restriction post-intervention (weighted mean difference: -1.36 [-3.23, 0.51], p = 0.15) and at follow-up (weighted mean difference: -0.82 [-3.76, 2.11], p = 0.58). Both interventions achieved comparable weight loss of >5 kg and therefore were associated with clinical benefits to health. The findings support the use of weekly intermittent energy restriction as an alternative option for the treatment of obesity. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support the long-term sustainable effects of weekly intermittent energy restriction on weight management.","Harris, L; McGarty, A; Hutchison, L; Ells, L; Hankey, C",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,61,1

BACKGROUND Forced air warming improves thermal comfort in comparison with standard care. It is not known whether the extra costs required for FAW are good value. DESIGN Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a randomized controlled trial conducted in 2016-2017. METHODS A cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken using Monte Carlo simulations from input distributions to estimate costs and effects associated with using FAW to reduce risk of thermal discomfort for patients receiving sedation in a cardiac catheterisation laboratory. A range of willingness to pay threshold values were tested with results plotted on a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. Costs were calculated in Australian currency ($AUD). RESULTS Estimated total costs were $5.21 (SD 3.26) higher per patient for FAW in comparison to standard care. Estimated probability of success (rating of thermal comfort) was 0.16 (0.06) higher for FAW. Forced air warming becomes more likely to result in a net benefit than standard care at a willingness to pay threshold of $34. CONCLUSION Forced air warming could be considered cost-effective for procedures performed with sedation in a cardiac catheterisation laboratory if the extra cost of an incremental gain in thermal comfort is less than the decision maker's willingness to pay for it. Therefore, those responsible for decision-making regarding use of FAW in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory can use results of our model to decide if it represents good value for their organisation.","Conway, Aaron; Duff, Jed; Sutherland, Joanna",Journal of advanced nursing,61,1

METHODS A 29-question anonymous online survey was sent by e-mail to members of the Italian Association of Medical Oncology and the Italian Breast Cancer Study Group on April 3, 2020. Only medical oncologists (both those in training and specialists) were invited to complete the questionnaire. RESULTS Out of 165 responding oncologists, 121 (73.3.%) worked in breast units. In the (neo)adjuvant setting, compared with before the emergency, fewer oncologists adopted weekly paclitaxel (68.5% v 93.9%) and a dose-dense schedule for anthracycline-based chemotherapy (43% v 58.8%) during the COVID-19 outbreak. In the metastatic setting, compared with before the emergency, fewer oncologists adopted first-line weekly paclitaxel for HER2-positive disease (41.8% v 53.9%) or CDK4/6 inhibitors for luminal tumors with less-aggressive characteristics (55.8% v 80.0%) during the COVID-19 outbreak. A significant change was also observed in delaying the timing for monitoring therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitors, assessing treatment response with imaging tests, and flushing central venous devices. Clinical research and scientific activities were reduced in 80.3% and 80.1% of respondents previously implicated in these activities, respectively. CONCLUSION Medical oncologists face many challenges in providing cancer care during the COVID-19 outbreak.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of colonic ESD in a porcine model using a novel endoscopic surgical platform, the Anubiscope (Karl Storz, Tüttlingen, Germany), equipped with two working channels for surgical instruments with four degrees of freedom offering surgical triangulation. METHODS Nine ESDs were performed by a surgeon without any ESD experience in three swine, at 25, 15, and 10 cm above the anal verge with the Anubiscope. Sixteen ESDs were performed by an experienced endoscopist in five swine using conventional endoscopic instruments. Major ESD steps included the following for both groups: scoring the area, submucosal injection of glycerol, precut, and submucosal dissection. Outcomes measured were as follows: dissection time and speed, specimen size, en bloc dissection, and complications. RESULTS No perforations occurred in the Anubis group, while there were eight perforations (50 %) in the conventional group (p = 0.02). Complete and en bloc dissections were achieved in all cases in the Anubis group. Mean dissection time for completed cases was statistically significantly shorter in the Anubis group (32.3 ± 16.1 vs. 55.87 ± 7.66 min; p = 0.0019). Mean specimen size was higher in the conventional group (1321 ± 230 vs. 927.77 ± 229.96 mm(2); p = 0.003), but mean dissection speed was similar (35.95 ± 18.93 vs. 23.98 ± 5.02 mm(2)/min in the Anubis and conventional groups, respectively; p = 0.1). CONCLUSIONS Colonic ESDs were feasible in pig models with the Anubiscope. This surgical endoscopic platform is promising for endoluminal surgical procedures such as ESD, as it is user-friendly, effective, and safe.","Diana, Michele; Chung, Hyunsoo; Liu, Keng-Hao; Dallemagne, Bernard; Demartines, Nicolas; Mutter, Didier; Marescaux, Jacques",Surgical endoscopy,61,9

Now, we show that these cells also mediate the same process in mice lacking alphabeta T cells (T-cell receptor beta-deficient [TCRbeta(-/-)] mice) and demyelination is gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) dependent. Most strikingly, our results also show a major role for NKG2D, expressed on gammadelta T cells, in the demyelinating process with in vivo blockade of NKG2D interactions resulting in a 60% reduction in demyelination. NKG2D may serve as a primary recognition receptor or as a costimulatory molecule. We show that NKG2D(+) gammadelta T cells in the JHM-infected central nervous system express the adaptor molecule DAP12 and an NKG2D isoform (NKG2D short), both required for NKG2D to serve as a primary receptor. These results are consistent with models in which gammadelta T cells mediate demyelination using the same effector cytokine, IFN-gamma, as CD8 T cells and do so without a requirement for signaling through the TCR.","Dandekar, Ajai A; O'Malley, Katherine; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of virology,61,19

Considerable political effort has been exercised in the twentieth century to restrict military strategies with chemicals.

The distribution of acetaminophen tablets contaminated with potassium cyanide and the release of sarin in the Tokyo sub-way system show that larger-scale deployment of chemical agents can be a reality. This reality makes it necessary for civilian disaster-planning strategies to incorporate an understanding of chemical agents, their effects, and the necessary treatment.","Fry, Donald E",The Surgical clinics of North America,61,30

Conservative strategies, including bed rest, bracing, and analgesic use, can be ineffective, resulting in continued pain and progressive functional disability limiting mobility and self-care. Surgery is not usually an option for cancer patients in advanced disease states because of their poor medical health or functional status and limited life expectancy. The objectives of this review were to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous image-guided vertebral augmentation techniques, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, for palliation of cancer-related vertebral compression fractures. METHODS We performed a systematic literature search for studies on vertebral augmentation of cancer-related vertebral compression fractures published from January 1, 2000, to October 2014; abstracts were screened by a single reviewer. For those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained. Owing to the heterogeneity of the clinical reports, we performed a narrative synthesis based on an analytical framework constructed for the type of cancer-related vertebral fractures and the diversity of the vertebral augmentation interventions. RESULTS The evidence review identified 3,391 citations, of which 111 clinical reports (4,235 patients) evaluated the effectiveness of vertebroplasty (78 reports, 2,545 patients) or kyphoplasty (33 reports, 1,690 patients) for patients with mixed primary spinal metastatic cancers, multiple myeloma, or hemangiomas. Overall the mean pain intensity scores often reported within 48 hours of vertebral augmentation (kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty), were significantly reduced. Analgesic use, although variably reported, usually involved parallel decreases, particularly in opioids, and mean pain-related disability scores were also significantly improved. In a randomized controlled trial comparing kyphoplasty with usual care, improvements in pain scores, pain-related disability, and health-related quality of life were significantly better in the kyphoplasty group than in the usual care group. Bone cement leakage, mostly asymptomatic, was commonly reported after vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Major adverse events, however, were uncommon. CONCLUSIONS Both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty significantly and rapidly reduced pain intensity in cancer patients with vertebral compression fractures. The procedures also significantly decreased the need for opioid pain medication, and functional disabilities related to back and neck pain. Pain palliative improvements and low complication rates were consistent across the various cancer populations and vertebral fractures that were investigated.",,Ontario health technology assessment series,61,16

A doubling time of 5.5 days (median with 95% CrI of 4.6-6.9 days) is observed. In the SEIR model this gives the basic reproduction rate R_0 of 3.4 (median with 95% CrI of 2.4-4.8). Using as input the infection fatality rate and the interval between infection and death, the number of infections in Mumbai is inferred. It is found that the ratio of the number of test positives to the total infections is 0.13\% (median), implying that tests are currently finding 1 out of 750 cases of infection. After correcting for different testing rates, this result is compatible with a measurement of the ratio made recently via serological testing in the USA. From the estimates of the number of infections we infer that the first COVID-19 cases were seeded in Mumbai between late December 2019 and early February 2020. provided the doubling times remained unchanged since then.

METHODS: We performed serologic testing on a convenience sample of residual sera obtained from persons of all ages, at ten sites in the United States from March 23 through August 14, 2020, from routine clinical testing at commercial laboratories. We age-sex-standardized our seroprevalence rates using census population projections and adjusted for laboratory assay performance. Confidence intervals were generated with a two-stage bootstrap. We used Bayesian modeling to test whether seroprevalence changes over time were statistically significant. RESULTS: Seroprevalence remained below 10% at all sites except New York and Florida, where it reached 23.2% and 13.3%, respectively. Statistically significant increases in seroprevalence followed peaks in reported cases in New York, South Florida, Utah, Missouri and Louisiana. In the absence of such peaks, some significant decreases were observed over time in New York, Missouri, Utah, and Western Washington. The estimated cumulative number of infections with detectable antibody response continued to exceed reported cases in all sites. CONCLUSIONS: Estimated seroprevalence was low in most sites, indicating that most people in the U.S. have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 as of July 2020. The majority of infections are likely not reported. Decreases in seroprevalence may be related to changes in healthcare-seeking behavior, or evidence of waning of detectable anti-SARS CoV-2 antibody levels at the population level. Thus, seroprevalence estimates may underestimate the cumulative incidence of infection.","Lim, Travis; Delorey, Mark; Bestul, Nicolette; Johannsen, Michael; Reed, Carrie; Hall, Aron J; Fry, Alicia M; Edens, Chris; Semenova, Vera; Li, Han; Browning, Peter; Desai, Rita; Epperson, Monica; Jia, Tao; Thornburg, Natalie J; Schiffer, Jarad; Havers, Fiona P",Clin. infect. dis,61,16

However, this phenomenon demands attention also in areas where media and patients were focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, but the healthcare system was not overwhelmed by the huge number of COVID-19 patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this observational study, we compared the incidence rate of all consecutive STEMI patients admitted at the University Hospital of Trieste, Italy, during March and April 2020 with the same 2 months of the previous 5 years (2015-2019). Patient characteristics were compared between 2020 and 2019.The incidence rate of STEMI admission in March-April 2020 was lower than those in March-April 2015-2019, 36 vs. 56 cases per 100â000âinhabitants/year [relative risk (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.42-0.96, Pâ=â0.045]. Considering that the incidence rates were constant in the past years (Pâ=â0.24), the turnaround in 2020 is most likely due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Interestingly, this reduction was a dynamic phenomenon with a U-shaped curve during the 2-month period. System-of-care times were similar between 2020 and 2019; however in 2020, patients presented more frequently signs of heart failure compared to 2019 (Killip class &#8805;2 in 68% vs. 29%, Pâ=â0.003). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 outbreak, we observed a marked reduction in the STEMI incidence rate. This U-shaped phenomenon demands attention because a potential cause for the decrease in STEMI incidence may include the avoidance of medical care. Public campaigns aiming to increase awareness of ischemic symptoms may be needed during community outbreak.","Fabris, Enrico; Bessi, Riccardo; De Bellis, Annamaria; Gregorio, Caterina; Peratoner, Alberto; Lardieri, Gerardina; Cominotto, Franco; Vitrella, Giancarlo; Rakar, Serana; Perkan, Andrea; Sinagra, Gianfranco",J. cardiovasc. med.

Current therapies are focused on the treatment of inflammation; however, there is an urgent need for innovative therapies promoting neuroregeneration, particularly myelin repair. It is demonstrated that testosterone can act through neural androgen receptors and several clinical observations stimulated an interest in the potential protective effects of testosterone treatment for MS. Here, we sought to demonstrate the effects of a testosterone supplementation in testosterone-deficient men with relapsing-remitting MS. METHODS/DESIGN: This report presents the rationale and methodology of TOTEM RRMS, a French, phase 2, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blind trial, which aims to prevent the progression of MS in men with low testosterone levels by administration of testosterone undecanoate, who were kept under natalizumab (Tysabri®) to overcome the anti-inflammatory effect of testosterone. Forty patients will be randomized into two groups receiving either a testosterone treatment (Nebido®) or a matching placebo. The intervention period for each group will last 66 weeks (treatment will be injected at baseline, week 6, and then every 12 weeks). The main objective is to determine the neuroprotective and remyelinating effects of testosterone using tensor diffusion imaging techniques and thalamic atrophy analyses. As secondary objectives, impacts of the testosterone supplementation will be studied using other conventional and unconventional MRI parameters and with clinical outcomes. DISCUSSION: The action of testosterone is observed in different experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models and epidemiological studies in humans. However, despite several preclinical data and some small clinical trials in MS, clear evidence for a therapeutic effect of hormone therapy is still missing. Therefore, our goal is to demonstrate the effects of testosterone therapies in MS. As there is no effective treatment currently available on fatigue in MS, careful attention should also be paid to secondary endpoints: fatigue, cognitive functions, and other symptoms that may improve life quality. Assuming a positive outcome of the trial, this treatment could be considered as a new neuroprotective and remyelinating therapy in relapsing-remitting MS and could be applicable to other demyelinating diseases.

Our objective was to review adjustments for hospitals and healthcare professionals across 20 countries. We developed an analytical framework distinguishing between payment adjustments compensating income loss and those covering extra costs related to COVID-19. Information was extracted from the Covid-19 Health System Response Monitor (HSRM) and classified according to the framework. We found that income loss was not a problem in countries where professionals were paid by salary or capitation and hospitals received global budgets. In countries where payment was based on activity, income loss was compensated through budgets and higher fees. New FFS payments were introduced to incentivize remote services. Payments for COVID-19 related costs included new fees for out- and inpatient services but also new PD and DRG tariffs for hospitals. Budgets covered the costs of adjusting wards, creating new (ICU) beds, and hiring staff. We conclude that public payers assumed most of the COVID-19-related financial risk. In view of future pandemics policymakers should work to increase resilience of payment systems by: (1) having systems in place to rapidly adjust payment systems;(2) being aware of the economic incentives created by these adjustments such as cost-containment or increasing the number of patients or services, that can result in unintended consequences such as risk selection or overprovision of care;and (3) periodically evaluating the effects of payment adjustments on access and quality of care.","Waitzberg, Ruth Sophie Gerkens Dimova Antoniya Bryndová Lucie Vrangbæk Karsten Jervelund Signe Smith Birk Hans Okkels Rajan Selina Habicht Triin Tynkkynen Liina-Kaisa Keskimäki Ilmo Or Zeynep Gandré Coralie Winkelmann Juliane Ricciardi Walter de Belvis Antonio Giulio Poscia Andrea Morsella Alisha Slapšinskaitė Agnė Miščikienė Laura Kroneman Madelon de Jong Judith Tambor Marzena Sowada Christoph Scintee Silvia Gabriela Vladescu Cristian Albreht Tit Bernal-Delgado Enrique Angulo-Pueyo Ester Estupiñán-Romero Francisco Nils Janlöv Mantwill Sarah Van Ginneken Ewout Quentin Wilm","Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",61,16

We continue with a review for the year 2020, which will be remembered by COVID and the significant negative impact it had on the industry. However, it also provided a glimpse of the possible improvement in air quality with reduced anthropogenic emissions. It was a year marked by goals set for climate change mitigation via reduced fossil fuel use by the transportation sector. Governments stepped up plans to accelerate the adoption of zero tailpipe emitting vehicles. However, any transformation of the transportation sector is not going to happen overnight due to the scale of the infrastructure and technology challenges. A case in point is China, which announced a technology roadmap which envisions half of the vehicles to be hybrids in 2035. The ICE is clearly expected to be part of the powertrain mix for a long time and as such, solutions are needed to attain near-zero emissions, even with conventional engines. The industry is naturally responding to all of these changes and several technology solutions are being advanced, including improved efficiency, advanced aftertreatment systems, hybridization, low carbon fuels and predictive control strategies. It was also a year of heightened regulatory activity on what could perhaps be the last major regulations on criteria pollutants in advanced markets. California adopted the Low NOx Omnibus rule requiring a 90% reduction in NOx from heavy-duty vehicles. Elements of light-duty LEV IV regulations were discussed, which could culminate in a fleet averaged NMOG + NOx limit of 20 mg/mi. Proposals were made for Euro 7/VII, and several major changes put forth for consideration, including tightening of limits, inclusion of sub-23 nm particles, an emphasis on urban driving and an overall shift in certification based on real-world driving emission measurements with limited allowed exclusions. Limits may be imposed on previously non-regulated species such as NH3 which will drive additional content. Technologies are advancing, both on engines and aftertreatment systems. Light-duty gasoline engines are approaching 45% BTE. Heavy duty diesel engines are approaching 55% BTE. We cover some of the major technologies being pursued to extend these gains. Gasoline particulate filters are now rapidly becoming a mature technology for light-duty vehicles in Europe and China, although the next round of regulations will require a significant increase in filtration efficiency. Concept studies show pathways to reduce gas emissions well below the next proposed limits. A major thrust on the heavy-duty side is to analyze systems capable of meeting the low NOx requirements while also extending durability. We cover the various leading approaches and latest advances in de-NOx technologies. We also briefly touch upon fuels, which will play a critical role, whether in improving efficiency of advanced combustion such as gasoline compression ignition or in their role with reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable or synthetic fuels. Finally, as we approach near-zero tailpipe emission levels, non-tailpipe emissions could become a significant fraction of the overall particulate inventory. © 2021 SAE International.

No significant difference was observed between lopinavir/ritonavir and non-antiviral treatment groups in terms of negative rate of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on day 7 (risk ratio [RR]: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.63 to 1.09; P=0.17), and day 14 (RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.81 to 1.05; P=0.25), PCR negative conversion time (mean difference [MD]: 1.09; 95% CI: -0.10 to 2.29; P=0.07), secondary outcomes, and adverse events (P>0.05). There was no significant difference between lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine as well as lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine regarding the efficacy outcomes (P>0.05). However, lopinavir/ritonavir showed better efficacy than arbidol for the same outcomes (P<0.05). Lopinavir/ritonavir plus arbidol was effective compared to arbidol alone in terms of the negative rate of PCR on day 7 (P=0.02). However, this difference was not significant regarding other efficacy outcomes (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Lopinavir/ritonavir has no more treatment effects than other therapeutic agents used herein in COVID-19 patients.","Amani, Bahman; Khanijahani, Ahmad; Amani, Behnam; Hashemi, Payam",J Pharm Pharm Sci,61,9

Pathogenesis of viral infection, co-morbidities, medical treatments, and psychosocial factors may contribute to COVID-19 related neuropsychological and psychiatric sequelae. This systematic review aims to synthesize available literature on psychiatric and cognitive characteristics of community-dwelling survivors of COVID-19 infection. RECENT FINDINGS: Thirty-three studies met inclusion/exclusion criteria for review. Emerging findings link COVID-19 to cognitive deficits, particularly attention, executive function, and memory. Psychiatric symptoms occur at high rates in COVID-19 survivors, including anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disruption, and to a lesser extent posttraumatic stress. Symptoms appear to endure, and severity of acute illness is not directly predictive of severity of cognitive or mental health issues. The course of cognitive and psychiatric sequelae is limited by lack of longitudinal data at this time. Although heterogeneity of study design and sociocultural differences limit definitive conclusions, emerging risk factors for psychiatric symptoms include female sex, perceived stigma related to COVID-19, infection of a family member, social isolation, and prior psychiatry history. SUMMARY: The extant literature elucidates treatment targets for cognitive and psychosocial interventions. Research using longitudinal, prospective study designs is needed to characterize cognitive and psychiatric functioning of COVID-19 survivors over the course of illness and across illness severity. Emphasis on delineating the unique contributions of premorbid functioning, viral infection, co-morbidities, treatments, and psychosocial factors to cognitive and psychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 is warranted.","Vanderlind, William Michael; Rabinovitz, Beth B; Miao, Iris Yi; Oberlin, Lauren E; Bueno-Castellano, Christina; Fridman, Chaya; Jaywant, Abhishek; Kanellopoulos, Dora",Curr Opin Psychiatry,61,1

Like the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also employs a receptor-binding motif (RBM) of its spike protein to bind a host receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), to gain entry. Currently, several mRNA or adenoviral vaccines encoding for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 are being used to boost antibodies capable of inhibiting spike-ACE2 interaction and viral entry. However, recent evidence has also suggested an anti-inflammatory effect of spike-reactive antibodies, suggesting that some SARS-CoV-2 spike-based vaccines may elicit protective antibodies capable of inhibiting GM-CSF production and COVID-19 progression.","Li, Jianhua; Wang, Ping; Tracey, Kevin J; Wang, Haichao",Mol Med,61,20

Traditional modes of knowledge dissemination have not been feasible. A rapid solution was needed to share guidance and implementation examples among the global Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) community. We designed the IPC Global Webinar Series to bring together subject matter experts and IPC professionals in the fight against COVID-19. METHODS: The Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) model was adapted to create an interactive global knowledge network. Speakers and panelists provided presentations and answers to questions from participants. The webinars were simultaneously interpreted to five languages and recorded for later access. RESULTS: Thirteen webinar sessions were completed from May 14 through August 6, 2020. On average, 634 participants attended each session (range: 393 - 1,181). Each session was represented by participants from an average of over 100 countries; sessions 1-3 had participation from approximate 120 countries, and sessions 6 and 12 had participation from approximately 80 countries. DISCUSSION: The IPC Global Webinar Series shared critical information and promoted peer-to-peer learning during the COVID-19 pandemic response. The webinar sessions reached a broader audience than many in-person events. The webinar series was rapidly scaled and can be rapidly re-activated as needed. Our lessons learned in designing and implementing the series can inform design of other global health virtual knowledge networks. The continued and expanded use of adapted virtual communities of practice and other learning networks for the IPC community can serve as a valuable tool for addressing COVID-19 and other infectious disease threats.","Wilson, Kathryn; Dennison, Cori; Struminger, Bruce; Armistad, Amy; Osuka, Hanako; Montoya, Eva; Padoveze, Maria Clara; Arora, Sanjeev; Park, Benjamin; Lessa, Fernanda C",Clin. infect. dis,61,30

Blood products are precious resources especially in the African context and this has been especially compounded during the Covid-19 pandemic. Concurrent to this during the Covid-19 level 5 lockdown in South Africa from 26 March - 30 April 2020, a decrease in trauma admissions to state hospitals was noted. The aim of this data collection was to assess whether lowered blood product issuance was seen during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown. Method: Areas at Tygerberg Hospital with trauma patients were identified, namely: the A1W intensive care unit (Surgical ICU), Trauma Front Room (Trauma Admissions), Trauma Resuscitation unit (Trauma Resus Area) and J7(Trauma Ward). Data of blood product issuance (red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma) for these 4 areas was provided by the Western Cape Blood Service for the period 26 March-30 April 2018, 2019 and 2020. This included the stage 5 Covid-19 South African lockdown, as well as Easter for all three years which is traditionally associated with raised trauma admissions. This data was quantitative. Results: 201 products were issued in 2018 versus 103 for the same period in 2020 for the 4 trauma areas in Tygerberg Hospital. The surgical ICU received the most products over 3â¯years with 183 of the product issuances. Discussion: As expected there was a significant decrease in blood product (red blood cell and fresh frozen plasma) issuance during the 2020 period which paralleled the lowered trauma numbers. This represented a significant cost saving of over R150 000 despite increased yearly costs for blood products over the same period. This data collection did not consider the reasoning for these blood transfusions or the clinical appropriateness thereof. The author acknowledges the wide variability of transfusion thresholds and protocols within various centres around the world, including Tygerberg and was not seeking to prove commentary on the appropriateness thereof in this research.","Shead, D C",,61,1

In the field of particles, complete orthogonality is ubiquitous between any two different identical particles, and these complete orthogonality (at the microscopic level) evolves into the partial spectral orthogonality between different species at the mesoscopic level. As a result, we developed SVD to TDSVD so as to reveal the relative amounts of different species in each time interval, and it is the first time that the single solution can be drew from only the TA spectroscopy data without any kinds of a priori information. In the previous articles, 'the underdetermination of GTA' has been addressed prominently, so it is no wonder that researchers are no longer keening to search the method for mathematically analyzing the TR-data in order to derive the single solution. However, TDSVD will offset the deficiency of being underdetermined in GTA and becomes an effectively autonomous method towards two-dimensional data analysis. Mathematically, as long as there is enough orthogonality between any two 'species' in any data matrix, the yield of the single solution is no longer a problem. Therefore, TDSVD can be applied to lots of fields.","Chen, Renli",,61,1

The consequence on clinical practice is that, when lacking results from a randomized trial, medical personnel is left without guidance on what seems to be effective in a real-world scenario. This article showcases a pragmatic methodology to obtain preliminary estimation of treatment effect from observational studies. Our approach was tested on the estimation of treatment effect of the proning maneuver on oxygenation levels, on a cohort of COVID-19 Intensive Care patients. We modeled our study design on a recent RCT for proning (the PROSEVA trial). Linear regression, propensity score models such as blocking and DR-IPW, BART and two versions of Counterfactual Regression were employed to provide estimates on observational data comprising first wave COVID-19 ICU patient data from 25 Dutch hospitals. 6371 data points, from 745 mechanically ventilated patients, were included in the study. Estimates for the early effect of proning -- P/F ratio from 2 to 8 hours after proning -- ranged between 14.54 and 20.11 mm Hg depending on the model. Estimates for the late effect of proning -- oxygenation from 12 to 24 hours after proning -- ranged between 13.53 and 15.26 mm Hg. All confidence interval being strictly above zero indicated that the effect of proning on oxygenation for COVID-19 patient was positive and comparable in magnitude to the effect on non COVID-19 patients. These results provide further evidence on the effectiveness of proning on the treatment of COVID-19 patients. This study, along with the accompanying open-source code, provides a blueprint for treatment effect estimation in scenarios where RCT data is lacking.

Results from the survey (81 respondents) show that, in Italian hospitals, minimally invasive surgery maintains its role despite the COVID-19 pandemic, with the registered reduction of cases being proportional to the overall reduction of the HPB surgical activity. Respondents agree that the switch from minimally invasive to open technique can be considered as a valid option for cases with a high technical complexity. Several issues merit specific attention: screening for virus positivity should be universally performed; only expert surgical teams should operate on positive patients and specific technical measures to lower the biological risk of contamination during surgery must be followed.

Therefore, this study assessed the efficacy of IMT on recovered COVID-19 patients following mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Forty-two recovered COVID-19 patients (33 men and 9 women) weaned from mechanical ventilation with a mean age of 48.05â±â8.85âyears were enrolled in this pilot control clinical study. Twenty-one patients were equipped to 2-week IMT (IMT group) and 21 matched peers were recruited as a control (control group). Forced vital capacity (FVC%), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1%), dyspnea severity index (DSI), quality of life (QOL), and six-minute walk test (6-MWT) were assessed initially before starting the study intervention and immediately after intervention. RESULTS: Significant interaction effects were observed in the IMT when compared to control group, FVC% (Fâ=â5.31, Pâ=â.041, Î·P2â=â0.13), FEV1% (Fâ=â4.91, Pâ=â.043, Î·P2â=â0.12), DSI (Fâ=â4.56, Pâ=â.032, Î·P2â=â0.15), QOL (Fâ=â6.14, Pâ=â.021, Î·P2â=â0.17), and 6-MWT (Fâ=â9.34, Pâ=â.028, Î·P2â=â0.16). Within-group analysis showed a significant improvement in the IMT group (FVC%, Pâ=â.047, FEV1%, Pâ=â.039, DSI, Pâ=â.001, QOL, Pâ<â.001, and 6-MWT, Pâ<â.001), whereas the control group displayed nonsignificant changes (Pâ>â.05). CONCLUSIONS: A 2-week IMT improves pulmonary functions, dyspnea, functional performance, and QOL in recovered intensive care unit (ICU) COVID-19 patients after consecutive weaning from mechanical ventilation. IMT program should be encouraged in the COVID-19 management protocol, specifically with ICU patients.","Abodonya, Ahmed M; Abdelbasset, Walid Kamal; Awad, Elsayed A; Elalfy, Ibrahim E; Salem, Hosni A; Elsayed, Shereen H",Medicine (Baltimore),61,13

The incidence and clinical-symptomatic manifestation of COVID-19 is different between northern and southern Italy. This study aims to evaluate the onset of alteration of smell and taste in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients in Sicily (extreme south of Italy). METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study was performed on asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) from May 1 to May 15, 2020. A questionnaire was used for evaluating the prevalence of smell and taste disorders in COVID-19 patients before performing nasopharyngeal swab. RESULTS: Of the total 292 patients, 242 (83.2%) were negative for SARS-CoV-2 and 50 were positive (16.8%). Twenty-six of the 50 (52%) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients reported smell/taste disorders. Twenty-eight of the 50 (57.1%) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were hospitalized (group A), and 22 (42.9%) were nonhospitalized (group B). The mean age in group A and group B was 45.4 ± 13.7 years and 57.0 ± 15.0, respectively (P = .007). The symptoms reported by hospitalized patients were fever (71.4%), cough (64.2%), fatigue (82.1%), and dyspnea (100%), while in nonhospitalized patients, the most reported symptoms were sore throat (72.7%), rhinorrhea (77.2%), and altered smell (81.8%). Anosmia/hyposmia reported in group A and group B was 28.5% and 81.8%, respectively (P = .001). CONCLUSION: These preliminary results indicate that the majority of SARS-Cov-2 positive patients in southern Italy did not require hospitalization and presented with milder symptoms or no symptoms and the alterations in smell and taste occurred.","Bianco, Maria Rita; Modica, Domenico M; Drago, Gaetano D; Azzolina, Alfio; Mattina, Gianfranco; De Natale, Massimo; Rossi, Giuseppe; Amata, Marta; Canzoneri, Gaspare; Manganaro, Giovanni; Di Gregorio, Francesco; Russo, Rosario; Pricoco, Salvatore; Saita, Vincenzo; Allegra, Eugenia",Ear Nose Throat J,61,1

Since it is well known that only a minority of patients develop high-titer neutralizing antibodies (nAb), as assessed by the viral neutralization tests (VNT), strategies to maximize cost-effectiveness of CCP collection are urgently needed. A growing amount of the population is having exposure to the virus and is hence becoming a candidate CCP donor. Laboratory screening with high-throughput serology has good correlations with the VNT titer, but upstream screening using clinical surrogates would be advisable. We review here the existing literature on clinical predictors of high-titer nAb. Older age, male sex, and hospitalization are the main proxies of high VNT and should drive CCP donor recruitment.","Focosi, Daniele; Franchini, Massimo",Eur J Haematol,61,1

These crises range from hunger, gender violence, shortage of food, low purchasing power and negative coping strategies. While intellectual resources have been remarkably outspoken about the effect of lockdown on Nigeria’s economy, the implications of the lockdown for household food security crisis have drawn little or no academic attention. Aim: Given this, the article examines the influence of the lockdown on households’ hunger and coping mechanisms. It further examines the nexus between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown and households’ low purchasing power. Setting: This is with the view to advance adequate strategy for minimising the effects of lockdown on food (in)security in Nigeria. Method: The article utilized a qualitative, descriptive research method. The article, is theoretical in nature, and drew its arguments from secondary sources, such as journals, books, newspapers, Internet sources, and official documents. Results: The finding indicates that the lockdown stimulates not only households’ hunger and negative coping habits but also low purchasing power. Conclusion: The article concludes that equitable and transparent distribution of palliatives is a good strategy capable of addressing households’ food (in)security crisis during Covid-19 lockdown in Nigeria.","Amusan, Lere Agunyai Samuel C.",Africa&#039;s Public Service Delivery and Performance Review,61,14

Nonetheless, the epidemiological situation is still of serious concern across the EU/EEA, with the majority of countries still experiencing high or increasing notification rates in older age groups and/or high death rates. Although vaccine rollout has started in all EU/EEA countries, targeting priority groups based on their risk of developing severe disease (the elderly and residents in long-term care facilities) as well as healthcare and other front-line workers, it is still too early to detect an impact on COVID-19 mortality or hospitalisations. While most countries are currently seeing a decline in overall infections as a response to NPIs, the introduction and increased spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants first identified in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P.1) has raised concerns. As suggested by recent anti-lockdown protests and civil disturbances in some European cities, pandemic fatigue could adversely affect the continued acceptance of and compliance with NPIs by the population. Since 21 January 2021, EU/EEA countries have observed a substantial increase in the number and proportion of SARS-CoV-2 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant, first reported in the United Kingdom. Ireland reports B.1.1.7 to be the dominant circulating SARS-CoV-2 strain and, based on growth trajectories observed, several other countries are expecting a similar situation in the coming weeks. The variant B.1.351 has also been increasingly reported in EU/EEA countries, often, but not only, linked to travel, and it has also been associated with outbreaks. The variant P.1 is so far being reported at lower levels, possibly because it is mainly linked to travel exchange with Brazil, where it appears to be spreading. The B.1.1.7 variant appears to be more transmissible than the previously predominant circulating strains and may cause more severe infection. Several countries where the variant has become dominant have seen rapid increases in incidence. This has resulted in increased hospitalisations, overstretched health systems and excess mortality. B.1.351 is also associated with increased transmissibility. In addition, there is evidence pointing to the potential for reduced effectiveness for some of the COVID-19 vaccines with this variant.",,SARS CoV,61,24

We assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the Ivorian public regarding preventive measures, conducting a hybrid survey across the country. Participants were invited to complete a questionnaire online, by phone, or face-to-face. Chi-squared, Fisher's exact, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare the frequency of responses regarding compliance with preventive measures. Data were validated for 564 individuals. Over one-third of respondents believed that COVID-19 was related to non-natural causes. Though the disease was perceived as severe, respondents did not consider it to be highly infectious. Overall, 35.6% of respondents fully trust health officials in the management of the pandemic, and 34.6% trusted them moderately. Individuals who believed COVID-19 was a disease caused by a pathogen and the well-educated were likely to comply with preventive measures. About 70% of respondents stated that their daily expenses had increased due to preventive measures.

The population that particularly has been affected by the pandemic is the group of patients suffering from diabetes mellitus. Having taken the public health in considerations, we have decided to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of diabetes mellitus on in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic literature review (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane) including all published clinical trials or observational studies published till December 10, 2020, was performed using following terms ""diabetes mellitus"" OR ""diabetes"" OR ""DM"" AND ""survival"" OR ""mortality"" AND ""SARS-CoV-2"" OR ""COVID-19"". RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included out of the 7327 initially identified studies. Mortality of DM patients vs non-DM patients was 21.3 versus 6.1%, respectively (OR = 2.39; 95%CI: 1.65, 3.64; P < 0.001), while severe disease in DM and non-DM group varied and amounted to 34.8% versus 22.8% (OR = 1.43; 95%CI: 0.82, 2.50; P = 0.20). In the DM group, the complications were observed far more often when compared with non-DM group, both in acute respiratory distress (31.4 vs. 17.2%; OR = 2.38; 95%CI:1.80, 3.13; P < 0.001), acute cardiac injury (22.0% vs. 12.8%; OR = 2.59; 95%CI: 1.81, 3.73; P < 0.001), and acute kidney injury (19.1 vs. 10.2%; OR = 1.97; 95%CI: 1.36, 2.85; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings, we shall conclude that diabetes is an independent risk factor of the severity of COVID-19 in-hospital settings; therefore, patients with diabetes shall aim to reduce the exposure to the potential infection of COVID-19.","Kaminska, Halla; Szarpak, Lukasz; Kosior, Dariusz; Wieczorek, Wojciech; Szarpak, Agnieszka; Al-Jeabory, Mahdi; Gawel, Wladyslaw; Gasecka, Aleksandra; Jaguszewski, Milosz J; Jarosz-Chobot, Przemyslawa",Acta diabetol,61,29

In the current study, we evaluated the Nanocurcumin effects on the Treg cell population and corresponding factors in mild and severe COVID-19 patients. To investigate the Nanocurcumin effects, 80 COVID-19 patients (40 at the severe stage and 40 at the mild stage) were selected and classified into Nanocurcumin and placebo arms. In both the Nanocurcumin and placebo groups, the Treg cell frequency, the gene expression of Treg transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FoxP3), and cytokines (IL-10, IL-35, and TGF-ß), as well as the serum levels of cytokines were measured before and after treatment. In both mild and severe COVID-19 patients, Nanocurcumin could considerably upregulate the frequency of Treg cells, the expression levels of FoxP3, IL-10, IL-35, and TGF-ß, as well as the serum secretion levels of cytokines in the Nanocurcumin-treated group compared to the placebo group. The abovementioned factors were remarkably increased in the post-treatment with Nanocurcumin before pre-treatment conditions. By contrast, it has been observed no notable alteration in the placebo group. Our findings revealed the SinaCurcumin® effective function in a significant increase in the number of Treg cells and their mediated factors in the Nanocurcumin group than in the placebo group in both mild and severe patients.

Moreover, the extent of leukocyte count decline remains to be studied. This study aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics of leukopenia in patients with SLE of Han ethnicity in China. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted in Chinese Han patients with SLE from June 2013 to August 2020. RESULTS: A total of 125 patients with SLE were included in the study, and 104 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited. The prevalence of leukopenia, neutropenia, and lymphopenia was 40.0, 20.8, and 55.2%, respectively. The median leukocyte count in the leukopenia group was 2.80 × 109/l, the median neutrophil count in the neutropenia group was 1.40 × 109/l, and the median lymphocyte count in the lymphopenia group was 0.60 × 109/l, which was 47.06, 40.58, and 30.00% of the median of the healthy control group, respectively. The lymphocyte count of SLE patients without lymphopenia was also lower than that of healthy controls, and the lymphocyte count was negatively correlated with the SLE disease activity index 2000 score in all patients with SLE. Independent risk factors for neutropenia include decreased platelet count and lymphocyte count, as well as the presentation of cylindruria. For lymphopenia, the independent risk factors were positivity for anti-dsDNA antibody and Coombs' test, decreased platelet count, and cylindruria. CONCLUSIONS: In Han Chinese patients with SLE, leukopenia, neutropenia, and lymphopenia are common clinical manifestations, and the degree of reduction in blood cell count was also remarkable. Lymphopenia is associated with disease severity in patients with SLE. The correlation between Coombs' test results and lymphopenia deserves further study.","Lu, Wentian; Zhong, Ying; Zhang, Yi; Liu, Zhichun; Xue, Leixi",,61,1

Willingness to be vaccinated differed by age (p < 0.001), by race and ethnicity (p < 0.001) and by level of education (p < 0.001). Willingness generally increased with age and education. Asians were most willing to be vaccinated, followed by non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Blacks (p < 0.001). Occupational groups differed in willingness (p < 0.001). Retired and students were more willing than all others (p < 0.001) followed by disabled or unemployed, healthcare workers, and educators. First Responders were least willing to be vaccinated (p < 0.001) followed by construction, maintenance and landscaping, homemakers, housekeeping, cleaning and janitorial workers, and retail and food service. The strongest predictor of willingness was confidence with the safety of the vaccine (r = 0.723, p < 0.001), followed by concern with protecting others by being vaccinated (r = 0.574, p < 0.001), and believing COVID-19 was serious enough to merit vaccination (r = 0.478, p < 0.00). Using multiple regression, confidence in safety was the strongest predictor for all groups. Protecting others was strongest for 13 of 15 demographic groups and 8 of 11 occupational groups. College educated, non-Hispanic Whites, first responders, construction, maintenance and landscape workers, housekeeping, cleaning and janitorial workers all gave greater weight to complacency about the disease.

BACKGROUND: Nurses, who are at the frontline of fighting against COVID-19, face numerous organizational and managerial challenges that impose a burden on their already heavy burden of infection. Working in challenging situations can affect the quality of nursing care. METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted through an interpretive phenomenological approach. To collect the data, 18 semi-structured interviews were held with 15 recovered nurses, which were then analyzed using van Manen's method. RESULTS: The data analysis led to the extraction of four themes: Nurses as victims of organizational prejudice, a profession surrounded by problems, insufficient sources for dealing with COVID-19, and post-COVID-19 development. CONCLUSION: This study showed the organizational and managerial challenges of recovered nurses from Covid-19. Although these nurses had positive experiences, they needed eliminating organizational prejudice, minimizing concerns, and sufficient resources to deal with the crisis. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: It is believed that these results can be used as a guide to nurse managers to improve the experience of recovered nurses from COVID-19 by treating all employees with equal kindness, considering to their problems, and minimizing burden by actively providing resources.","Radfar, M.; Hemmati Maslak Pak, M.; Mohammadi, F.",J Nurs Manag,61,15

This study estimates the prevalence of COVID-19 among farmers and farmworkers in the United States by coupling county-level data on the number of farm workers relative to the general population with data on confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. In the 13 month period since the start of the pandemic (from March 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021), the estimated cumulative number of COVID-19 cases (deaths) was 329,031 (6,166) among agricultural producers, 170,137 (2,969) among hired agricultural workers, 202,902 (3,812) among unpaid agricultural workers, and 27,223 (459) among migrant agricultural workers. The cases amount to 9.55%, 9.31%, 9.39%, and 9.01% of all U.S. agricultural producers, hired workers, unpaid workers, and migrant workers, respectively. The COVID-19 incidence rate is significantly higher in counties with more agricultural workers; a 1% increase in the number of hired agricultural workers in a county is associated with a 0.04% increase in the number of COVID-19 cases per person and 0.07% increase in deaths per person. Although estimated new cases among farm workers exhibit similar trends to that of the general population, the correlation between the two is sometimes negative, highlighting the need to monitor this particular population that tends to live in more rural areas. Reduction in labor availability from COVID-19 is estimated to reduce U.S. agricultural output by about $309 million.","Lusk, Jayson L; Chandra, Ranveer",PLoS One,61,26

Clinically, nafamostat is limited to intravenous delivery and while camostat is orally available, both drugs have extremely short plasma half-lives. This study sought to determine whether intranasal dosing at 5 mg/kg twice daily was able to prevent airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected to uninfected Syrian golden hamsters. SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was above the limits of quantification in both saline- and camostat-treated hamsters 5 days after cohabitation with a SARS-CoV-2 inoculated hamster. However, intranasal nafamostat-treated hamsters remained RNA negative for the full 7 days of cohabitation. Changes in body weight over the course of the experiment were supportive of a lack of clinical symptomology in nafamostat-treated but not saline- or camostat-treated animals. These data are strongly supportive of the utility of intranasally delivered nafamostat for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and further studies are underway to confirm absence of pulmonary infection and pathological changes.","Neary, Megan; Box, Helen; Sharp, Joanne; Tatham, Lee; Curley, Paul; Herriott, Joanne; Kijak, Edyta; Arshad, Usman; Hobson, James J; Rajoli, Rajith KR; Pertinez, Henry; Valentijn, Anthony; Dhaliwal, Kevin; McCaughan, Frank; Rannard, Steve P; Kipar, Anja; Stewart, James P; Owen, Andrew",,61,16

Thus, our objective was to investigate how human arterial adventitial fibroblasts inflammation, thrombosis and diabetic disease markers are altered in response to Spike, Nucleocapsid and Membrane-Envelope proteins. We hypothesized that after a short-term exposure to SARS-CoV-2 proteins, adventitial fibroblasts would have a higher expression of inflammatory, thrombotic and diabetic proteins, which would support a mechanism for altered vascular disease progression. After incubation, the expression of gC1qR, ICAM-1, tissue factor, RAGE and GLUT-4 was significantly up-regulated. In general, the extent of expression was different for each SARS-CoV-2 protein, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 proteins interact with cells through different mechanisms.

Methodological approaches to investigate the health impacts of air pollution on epidemics should differ from those used for chronic diseases, but the methods used in these studies have not been appraised critically. OBJECTIVES: Our study aimed to identify and critique the methodological approaches of studies of air pollution on infections and mortality due to COVID-19 and to identify and critique the methodological approaches of similar studies concerning severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHODS: Published and unpublished papers of associations between air pollution and developing or dying from COVID-19 or SARS that were reported as of 10 May 2020 were identified through electronic databases, internet searches, and other sources. RESULTS: All six COVID-19 studies and two of three SARS studies reported positive associations. Two were time series studies that estimated associations between daily changes in air pollution, one was a cohort that assessed associations between air pollution and the secondary spread of SARS, and six were ecological studies that used area-wide exposures and outcomes. Common shortcomings included possible cross-level bias in ecological studies, underreporting of health outcomes, using grouped data, the lack of highly spatially resolved air pollution measures, inadequate control for confounding and evaluation of effect modification, not accounting for regional variations in the timing of outbreaks' temporal changes in at-risk populations, and not accounting for nonindependence of outcomes. DISCUSSION: Studies of air pollution and novel coronaviruses have relied mainly on ecological measures of exposures and outcomes and are susceptible to important sources of bias. Although longitudinal studies with individual-level data may be imperfect, they are needed to adequately address this topic. The complexities involved in these types of studies underscore the need for careful design and for peer review. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7411.","Villeneuve, Paul J; Goldberg, Mark S",Environ Health Perspect,61,24

Initially, we establish the positivity and boundedness of the solutions of the model and calculate the basic reproduction number. We then formulate an optimal control problem with vaccination and treatment as control variables. Optimal vaccination and treatment policies are analysed for different values of the weight constant associated with the cost of vaccination and different transmissibility levels. Findings from these suggested that the combined strategies(vaccination and treatment) worked best in minimizing the infection and disease induced mortality. In order to reduce COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 induced deaths to maximum, it was observed that optimal control strategy should be prioritized to population with age greater than 40 years. Not much difference was found between individual strategies and combined strategies in case of mild epidemic ($R_0 \in (0, 2)$). For higher values of $R_0 (R_0 \in (2, 10))$ the combined strategies was found to be best in terms of minimizing the overall infection. The infection curves varying the efficacies of the vaccines were also analysed and it was found that higher efficacy of the vaccine resulted in lesser number of infection and COVID induced death.","Chhetri, Bishal; Vamsi, D.k.k.; Balasubramanian, S; Sanjeevi, Carani B",,61,30

Consequently, many of them decided to close their educational institutions as a way of preventing the spread of this virus. For many of them, though, the closure made them unable to deliver learning materials to students owing to their inability to provide the right technology for the purpose. To assist with the digitalizing of learning during this time, this study reviews the most common technologies used in the delivery of learning materials, with the experience of most infected countries being considered. Major challenges in online learning are discussed in this study as well. Further, Saudi Arabia was considered as a case study for the effectiveness of distance learning during the 2020 spring semester, where 300 undergraduate students were surveyed on their opinions of distance learning. The responses to the survey indicated that distance learning was effective in providing the required knowledge to the students during the outbreak of COVID-19. The findings showed that although the lack of interaction and poor internet connections were factors affecting comfortable and successful learning of physics and mathematics, 63% of students were satisfied with learning management systems, 75% of students found it easy to understand course materials, and 67% of students found it easy to understand assignments and could deal with them comfortably.

However, it is estimated that approximately one-third of the US and international population are hesitant to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. For most Western countries with the economic means to purchase sufficient vaccine for their citizens, the medical community now has the opportunity to lead the vaccination communication campaign. Because frontline clinicians were the first to be vaccinated in the United States (US), they are uniquely positioned to be the most trusted source of vaccine information. Primary care clinicians, more than other groups of clinicians, scientists, government officials, media, etc. have the greatest chance for instilling confidence about the vaccine to their patients, including the most vulnerable and the most distrusting. They are considered credible and trustworthy allies for their patients in the US, however, clinicians receive little to no formal training in communication related to controversial topics, such as vaccine hesitancy. With the increasing worry about highly transmissible COVID-19 viral mutations and possible related vaccine resistance, it becomes even more critical to accelerate vaccination efforts across every community.

In the search for possible causes, we investigate the situation of such facilities before the pandemic. Two aspects are analyzed: their institutional embeddedness and recent trends in their management.

We aimed to investigate beliefs about COVID-19 diagnosis, transmission and prevention that have the potential to impact the uptake of recommended public health strategies. DESIGN: An online cross-sectional survey. PARTICIPANTS: A national sample of 1500 Australian adults with representative quotas for age and gender provided by an online panel provider. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Proportion of participants with correct/incorrect knowledge of COVID-19 preventive behaviours and reasons for misconceptions. RESULTS: Of the 1802 potential participants contacted, 289 did not qualify, 13 declined and 1500 participated in the survey (response rate 83%). Most participants correctly identified 'washing your hands regularly with soap and water' (92%) and 'staying at least 1.5 m away from others' (90%) could help prevent COVID-19. Over 40% (incorrectly) considered wearing gloves outside of the home would prevent them from contracting COVID-19. Views about face masks were divided. Only 66% of participants correctly identified that 'regular use of antibiotics' would not prevent COVID-19.Most participants (90%) identified 'fever, fatigue and cough' as indicators of COVID-19. However, 42% of participants thought that being unable to 'hold your breath for 10 s without coughing' was an indicator of having the virus. The most frequently reported sources of COVID-19 information were commercial television channels (56%), the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (43%) and the Australian Government COVID-19 information app (31%). CONCLUSIONS: Public messaging about hand hygiene and physical distancing to prevent transmission appears to have been effective. However, there are clear, identified barriers for many individuals that have the potential to impede uptake or maintenance of these behaviours in the long term. We need to develop public health messages that harness these barriers to improve future cooperation.

The virus is an emerging infectious agent causing acute human infection worldwide. A high seroprevalence of the disease was reported in pregnant women in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, raising significant public health concern. The presence of HEV specific antibodies were also reported in dromedary camels in the country; however, the infectious virus and/or the viral genome have not been demonstrated to date in animal samples. METHODS: To address this gap, a total of 95 faecal samples collected from both apparently healthy pigs of uncharacterised types (50 samples) in Burayu and Addis Ababa areas and camels (Camelus dromedarius, 45 samples) in west Hararghe were screened for the presence of HEV genome using universal primers in a fully nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (nRT-PCR). The protocol is capable of detecting HEV in faecal samples from both pigs and camels. RESULTS: The nRT-PCR detected HEV genes in six (12%) pig faecal samples and one camel sample (2.2%). Therefore, the results indicate that HEV is circulating in both pigs and camels in Ethiopia and these animals and their products could serve as a potential source of infection for humans. CONCLUSION: The detection of HEV in both animals could raise another concern regarding its public health importance as both animals' meat and camel milk are consumed in the country. Further studies to determine the prevalence and distribution of the virus in different animals and their products, water bodies, food chain, and vegetables are warranted, along with viral gene sequencing for detailed genetic characterisation of the isolates circulating in the country. This information is critically important to design and institute appropriate control and/or preventive measures.","Bari, Fufa Dawo; Wodaje, Haimanot Belete; Said, Umer; Waktole, Hika; Sombo, Melaku; Leta, Samson; Chibsa, Tesfaye Rufael; Plummer, Paul",Virol J,61,3

The European continent is proud to have developed one of the most effective mechanisms of the human rights protection by establishing the Council of Europe and adopting the European Court of Human Rights. The recent outbreak of the COVID-19 reformulated many concepts of access to human rights and possibilities to enjoy freedoms.

The article aims to analyze the current situation in Europe by asking questions if and how online access to culture is recognized and protected under the Council of Europe's mechanisms with special emphasis on the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights in this field.","Kuzelewska, Elzbieta; Tomaszuk, Mariusz",Int J Semiot Law,61,16

Qualitative interview-based study with dermatologists",21.16013,0.954548,2021,"BACKGROUND: In light of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, how resources are managed and the critically ill are allocated must be reviewed. Although ethical recommendations have been published, strategies for dealing with overcapacity of critical care resources have so far not been addressed. OBJECTIVES: Assess expert opinion for allocation preferences regarding the growing imbalance between supply and demand for medical resources. DESIGN: A 10-item questionnaire was developed and sent to the most prominent members of the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC). SETTING: Survey via a web-based platform. PATIENTS: Respondents were members of the National Anaesthesiologists Societies Committee and Council Members of the ESAIC; 74 of 80 (92.5%), responded to the survey. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Responses were analysed thematically. The majority of respondents (83.8%), indicated that resources for COVID-19 were available at the time of the survey. Of the representatives of the ESAIC governing bodies, 58.9% favoured an allocation of excess critical care capacity: 69% wished to make them available to supraregional patients, whereas 30.9% preferred to keep the resources available for the local population. Regarding the type of distribution of resources, 35.3% preferred to make critical care available, 32.4% favoured the allocation of medical equipment and 32.4% wished to support both options. The majority (59.5%) supported the implementation of a central European institution to manage such resource allocation. CONCLUSION: Experts in critical care support the allocation of resources from centres with overcapacity. The results indicate the need for centrally administered allocation mechanisms that are not based on ethically disputable triage systems. It seems, therefore, that there is wide acceptance and solidarity among the European anaesthesiological community that local medical and human pressure should be relieved during a pandemic by implementing national and international re-allocation strategies among healthcare providers and healthcare systems.","Adam, Elisabeth H; Flinspach, Armin N; Jankovic, Radmilo; De Hert, Stefan; Zacharowski, Kai",Eur. j. anaesthesiol,61,20

Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on neurosurgical practice and to determine whether surgical procedures are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A multicenter case-control study was conducted, involving patients who underwent neurosurgical intervention in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during 2 periods: pre-COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The surgical intervention data evaluated included diagnostic category, case priority, complications, length of hospital stay, and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: A total of 850 procedures were included, 36% during COVID-19. The median number of procedures per day was significantly lower during the COVID-19 period (5.5 cases) than during the pre-COVID-19 period (12 cases; P < 0.0001). Complications, length of hospital stay, and 30-day mortality did not differ during the pandemic. In a multivariate analysis comparing both periods, case priority levels 1 (immediate) (odds ratio [OR], 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-2.67), 1 (1-24 h) (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.10-2.41), and 4 (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.19-0.42) showed significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: During the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall number of neurosurgical procedures declined, but the load of emergency procedures remained the same, thus highlighting the need to allocate sufficient resources for emergencies. More importantly, performing neurosurgical procedures during the pandemic in regions with limited effects of the outbreak on the health care system was safe. Our findings may aid in developing guidelines for acute and long-term care during pandemics in surgical subspecialties.","Bajunaid, Khalid; Alqurashi, Ashwag; Alatar, Abdullah; Alkutbi, Mohammad; Alzahrani, Anas H; Sabbagh, Abdulrahman J; Alobaid, Abdullah; Barnawi, Abdulwahed; Alferayan, Ahmed Abdulrahman; Alkhani, Ahmed M; Salamah, Ali Bin; Sheikh, Bassem Yousef; Alotaibi, Fahad E; Alabbas, Faisal; Farrash, Faisal; Al-Jehani, Hosam M; Alhabib, Husam; Alnaami, Ibrahim; Altweijri, Ikhlass; Khoja, Isam; Taha, Mahmoud; Alzahrani, Moajeb; Bafaquh, Mohammed S; Binmahfoodh, Mohammed; Algahtany, Mubarak Ali; Al-Rashed, Sabah; Raza, Syed Muhammad; Elwatidy, Sherif; Alomar, Soha A; Al-Issawi, Wisam; Khormi, Yahya H; Ammar, Ahmad; Al-Habib, Amro; Baeesa, Saleh S; Ajlan, Abdulrazag",World neurosurgery (Online),61,20

The PUR$\diamond$GEM consists of a series of UV disinfection chambers through which constant airflow is maintained via fans. A minimum air flow rate of $\sim20-30$ L/min is sufficient to keep CO$_2$ levels $\lesssim$ 0.5% in the hood/helmet. We validated that using easily available PTFE wrap, a factor of $\sim 18$ enhancement in UV power can be obtained in our spherical chambers. Detailed analysis is presented for the air travel time distributions through the cavities, and the expectation value for actual pathogen elimination is computed. We provide the scaling of pathogen elimination with the number of cavities in series, reflective enhancement, UV source power, sphere radius and airflow rate. We show that disinfection greater than 4-log is achievable for a series of three or more spheres. We 3D printed our prototype, consisting of two spheres of 10 cm diameter each in series for each direction of disinfection. Using UVC LEDs emitting $\sim$ 40 mW of power each with an airflow rate of 30 L/min, actual SARS-COV2 virus elimination of $\sim$ 98% is expected. While not manually feasible to construct smaller spheres in the lab, smaller cavities can be commercially manufactured, leading to significantly higher actual pathogen elimination, as well as reducing fingerprint and cost of cavity manufacture.

Usually, viral protein targets host proteins in an organized fashion. The expression of any viral gene depends mostly on the host translational machinery. Recent studies report the great significance of codon usage biases in establishing host-viral protein-protein interactions (PPI). Exploring the codon usage patterns between a pair of co-evolved host and viral proteins may present novel insight into the host-viral protein interactomes during disease pathogenesis. Leveraging the similarity in codon usage patterns, we propose a computational scheme to recreate the host-viral protein-protein interaction network. We use host proteins from seventeen (17) essential signaling pathways for our current work towards understanding the possible targeting mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 proteins. We infer both negatively and positively interacting edges in the network. Further, extensive analysis is performed to understand the host PPI network topologically and the attacking behavior of the viral proteins. Our study reveals that viral proteins mostly utilize codons, rare in the targeted host proteins (negatively correlated interaction). Among them, non-structural proteins, NSP3 and structural protein, Spike (S), are the most influential proteins in interacting with multiple host proteins. While ranking the most affected pathways, MAPK pathways observe to be the worst affected during the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Several proteins participating in multiple pathways are highly central in host PPI and mostly targeted by multiple viral proteins. We observe many potential targets (host proteins) from the affected pathways associated with the various drug molecules, including Arsenic trioxide, Dexamethasone, Hydroxychloroquine, Ritonavir, and Interferon beta, which are either under clinical trial or in use during COVID-19.","Das, Jayanta Kumar; Chakraborty, Subhadip; Roy, Swarup",J Biomed Inform,61,31

Indeed, collagen is expected to be a biomarker for chronic diseases and could monitor their progression. Here we show detection of highly diluted samples of collagen at picogram level thanks to an innovative pyro-electrohydrodynamic jet (p-jet) system. Through the intense electric fields generated by the pyroelectric effect in a ferroelectric crystal, the collagen solution was concentrated on a small area of a slide that was appropriately functionalized to bind proteins. The collagen molecules were labeled by an appropriate fluorophore to show how the number of tiny droplets influences the limit of detection of the technique. The results show that the p-jet is extremely promising for overcoming the current detection limits of collagen-based products in human fluids, performing 10 times better than the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and thus paving the way for the early diagnosis of related chronic diseases.","Rega, Romina; Mugnano, Martina; Oleandro, Emilia; Tkachenko, Volodymyr; Del Giudice, Danila; Bagnato, Gianluca; Ferraro, Pietro; Grilli, Simonetta; Gangemi, Sebastiano",,61,13

While greatly emphasizing protection, most guiding documents have neglected to support and protect the psychosocial needs of frontline health care workers and patients and their families during provision of palliative and end-of-life care. Consequently, the stage has been set for increased anxiety, moral distress, and moral injury and extreme moral hazard. A family-centered approach to care has been unilaterally relinquished to a secondary and nonessential role during the current crisis. This phenomenon violates a foundational public health principle, namely, to apply the least restrictive means to achieve good for the many. Instead, there has been widespread adoption of utilitarian and paternalistic approaches. In many cases the foundational principles of palliative care have also been neglected. No circumstance, even a global public health emergency, should ever cause health care providers to deny their ethical obligations and human commitment to compassion. The lack of responsive protocols for family visitation, particularly at the end of life, is an important gap in the current recommendations for pandemic triage and contingency planning. A stepwise approach to hospital visitation using a tiered, standardized process for responding to emerging clinical circumstances and individual patients' needs should be considered, following the principle of proportionality. A contingency plan, based on epidemiological data, is the best strategy to refocus health care ethics in practice now and for the future.","Jones-Bonofiglio, Kristen; Nortjé, Nico; Webster, Laura; Garros, Daniel",Am J Crit Care,61,1

Despite the increased risk of COVID-19 for the IDD community, there has been less attention drawn to the impact of the pandemic on people with IDD, especially beyond their health and safety. Yet, PWIDD also face unique challenges as a result of the pandemic compared to other populations. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life outcomes of PWIDD. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of Personal Outcome Measures® interviews from 2019 to 2020 (n = 2284).

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively hindered the quality of life outcomes of PWIDD in a number of different areas. While the pandemic has been undoubtably hard on the IDD community, in many ways it has simply intensified an underfunded and fractured IDD service system. However the IDD service system evolves during and after the pandemic, it must be done in a way that prioritizes the quality of life of PWIDD and what is most important to them.","Friedman, Carli",Disabil Health J,61,16

With data from Wuhan and Italy indicating a significant mortality rate in the region of 1-3% and identification of the risks of co-morbidities, hemato-oncology patients were quickly identified as being at a heightened risk from the virus due to baseline and chemotherapy induced immunosuppression. Data has shown that patients with cancer have a significantly higher incidence of severe events following infection with SARS-CoV-19 than those without cancer. Unlike many reported case series, our institution sees an unselected take of all hemato-oncology diagnoses within a large, ethnically-diverse locality and therefore provides an unfiltered snapshot of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 at an all-inclusive, population level. Methods Prospective data collection was carried out on all hemato-oncology patients admitted with a confirmed diagnosis of Covid-19 during March and April 2020 by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay on a nasopharyngeal aspirate across two sites in one of London's largest District General Hospital Trusts. Our institution has a catchment area of 810 000 heads of population of which 38-46.5% are of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) ethnicity depending on locality. Results We identified a total of 30 hemato-oncology patients admitted with PCR proven SARS-CoV-19. Their baseline characteristics are shown in figure 1. When compared with our cancer registry data (Fig 2A) this highlights a disproportionate representation of BAME patients (57% of cases vs 26% of base population). Lymphoid malignancies and plasma cell dyscrasias (PCD) accounted for 90% of the admissions. CLL and PCD accounted for 30% and 23% respectively (Fig 2C). Co-morbidities were less prevalent than those seen in patient cohorts without hematological malignancy. 70% of patients had =1 co-morbidity and only 29% had >/= 2 comorbidities (Fig 2B) highlighting that, unlike other non-oncology series, hematological malignancy alone acts as a major risk factor for serious illness. Hypertension and Diabetes were the most common risk factors, seen in 50% and 43% of patients respectively. The most common presenting features were cough (84%), fever (72%) and shortness of breath (80%). 16% had Gastrointestinal symptoms, but only seen in the context of concurrent respiratory symptoms. The vast majority (84%) had radiological changes consistent with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Our cohort had a mortality rate of 47%. Of those that died, 57% were from BAME groups and 43% were White. 71% of those that died had either CLL (6/14 cases) or multiple myeloma (MM) (4/14 cases). CLL appears to be an independent risk factor from age, as two of the patients with CLL that died were amongst the youngest in our cohort (47 years and 59 years). Two patients that died had Myelodysplastic syndrome, one had Diffuse large B cell lymphoma and one had Hodgkin's lymphoma. We found that age and number of co-morbidities were positively associated with death. Of the patients that died, 79% were 70 years of age or over and the majority of survivors were 60 years old or younger (56%). Lymphopenia was a consistent finding at diagnosis (median lymphocyte count 0.8 x 109/l), neutropenia was rare (median neutrophil count 5.9 x 109/l) and C-reactive protein was elevated in all cases (median value 169, range 42-473 mg/l). Of our 4 patients with plasma cell dyscrasias who died, 2 had end stage myeloma (4th line+ of therapy), 1 had primary refractory MM and 1 had plasma cell leukaemia, thus identifying these patients as extremely high risk from the outset. Conclusion It is of great importance to identify patient and disease specific risk factors conferring poor risk amongst our hemato-oncology patients. With shielding, invariably comes the increased risk of morbidity from social isolation and delayed presentation of non-COVID illness. Our data shows that CLL and BAME patients appear to be at particular risk of severe illness and poor outcomes. In a local ethnically diverse population, our patients are at heightened risk of morbidity and mortality and must be offered all strategies for interventions that may reduce likelihood of becoming infected with COVID 19 and should be considered early for vaccination, convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies.

The risk factors do not fully explain the wide spectrum of disease manifestations, so it is possible that genetic factors could account for novel insights into its pathogenesis. In our previous study, we hypothesized that common variants on chromosome 21, near TMPRSS2 and MX1 genes, may be genetic risk factors associated to the different clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Here, we performed an in-depth genetic analysis of chromosome 21 exploiting the genome-wide association study data including 6,406 individuals hospitalized for COVID-19 and 902,088 controls with European genetic ancestry from COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. We found that five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within TMPRSS2 and near MX1 gene show suggestive associations (P[≤]1x10-5) with severe COVID-19. All five SNPs replicated the association in two independent cohorts of Asian subjects while two and one out of the 5 SNPs replicated in African and Italian populations, respectively (P[≤]0.05). The minor alleles of these five SNPs correlated with a reduced risk of developing severe COVID-19 and increased level of MX1 expression in blood. Our findings provide further evidence that host genetic factors can contribute to determine the different clinical presentations of COVID-19 and that MX1, an antiviral effector of type I and III interferon pathway, may be a potential therapeutic target.","Andolfo, I.; Russo, R.; Lasorsa, A.

We performed a PubMed and Google Scholar search and reviewed relevant literature on COVID‐19 and cardiovascular system involvement. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 possesses high affinity for angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 receptor, which is highly concentrated in the lungs and cardiovascular tissue, thereby provoking concern for cardiovascular involvement in COVID‐19 cases. Preexisting cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease has been shown in previous reports to be a risk factor for severe infection. On the basis of our review of published studies, COVID‐19 patients may be more likely to experience acute cardiac injury, arrhythmia, coagulation defects, and acute stroke and are likely to have poorer outcomes as a result. As the COVID‐19 pandemic continues, more data about potential cardiovascular and cerebrovascular manifestations of the disease are required.","Larson, Anthony S.; Savastano, Luis; Kadirvel, Ramanathan; Kallmes, David F.; Hassan, Ameer E.; Brinjikji, Waleed",J Am Heart Assoc,61,16

These patients are also at risk for severe course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Statins exhibit not only cardioprotective but also immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. This study performed a systematic review of published evidence regarding statin treatment and COVID-19 related mortality. METHODS: A systematic PubMed/Embase search was performed from February 10, 2020 until March 05, 2021 for studies in COVID-19 patients that reported adjusted hazard or odds ratio for death in statin users versus non-users. RESULTS: 22 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. Meta-analysis of 10 studies (n = 41,807, weighted age 56 ± 8 years, men 51%, hypertension 34%, diabetes 21%, statin users 14%) that reported adjusted hazard ratios for mortality in statin users versus non-users showed pooled estimate at 0.65 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.53, 0.81). Meta-analysis of 6 studies that reported continuation of statin therapy during hospitalization (58–100% of patients) revealed a pooled hazard ratio of 0.54 (95% CI 0.47, 0.62). Meta-analysis of 12 studies (n = 72,881, weighted age 65 ± 2 years, men 54%, hypertension 66%, diabetes 43%, statin users 30%) that reported adjusted odds ratios for mortality showed pooled estimate at 0.65 (95% CI 0.55, 0.78). Multivariable meta-regression analysis did not reveal any significant association of hazard or odds ratios with anthropometric characteristics or comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of retrospective observational studies showed that statin therapy was associated with an about 35% decrease in the adjusted risk of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Kollias, Anastasios; Kyriakoulis, Konstantinos G.; Kyriakoulis, Ioannis G.; Nitsotolis, Thomas; Poulakou, Garyphallia; Stergiou, George S.; Syrigos, Konstantinos",Atherosclerosis,61,32

The aim of our research is to analyse evidence from the Active Lives South Australia study to consider the potential of physical activity (PA) health promotion strategies to be health-system cost saving while addressing wellbeing challenges. METHODS: The Active Lives South Australia study compares adult populations who meet and do not meet physical activity (PA) guidelines (150+ minutes of weekly physical activity) with respect to their subjective wellbeing and health care utilisation. SUBJECT AND RESULTS: Adults who met PA guidelines had better wellbeing across all aspects with and without adjustment for age, sex and income covariates. Analysis showed significant associations between meeting guidelines and lower probabilities of visiting and utilisation of GPs, specialist doctors, other health professionals, hospital inpatient admissions, outpatient clinic and emergency department visits, and an overall A$1760 lower cost per person annually. Controlling for age, sex and income, health expenditure for adults who met PA guidelines was significantly lower by A$1393 per person annually. That translated to A$804 million potential annual SA health system cost saving by shifting all adults to meeting PA guidelines. CONCLUSION: There is significant potential for effective health promotion strategies to be net cost saving while addressing wellbeing challenges of COVID-19 recovery where they can shift target populations from not meeting to meeting PA guidelines.","Eckermann, Simon; Willan, Andrew R.",Z Gesundh Wiss,61,8

Methods: A cross-sectional, epidemiological study of positive SARS-CoV-2 cases, reported in the south region of the city of Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil, from March 2020 to February 2021. Data were obtained from the official reporting databases of the Brazilian Ministry of Health for influenza-like illness (ILI) (esus-VE, in Portuguese) and for patients hospitalized for SARS (SIVEP-Gripe). The space distribution of cases is described by 2D kernel density. To assess potential factors associated with the outcomes of interest, generalized linear and additive logistic models were adjusted. To evaluate the discriminatory power of each variable studied as well as the final model, C-statistic was used (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve). Moreover, a predictive model for risk of death was developed and validated with accuracy measurements in the development, internal and temporal (March and April 2021) validation samples. Results: A total of 16,061 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. Morbidities associated with a higher risk of SARS were obesity (OR=25.32) and immunodepression (OR=12.15). Morbidities associated with a higher risk of death were renal disease (OR=11.8) and obesity (OR=8.49), and clinical and demographic data were more important than the territory per se. Based on the data, a calculator was developed to predict the risk of death from COVID-19, with 92.2% accuracy in the development sample, 92.3% in the internal validation sample, and 80.0% in the temporal validation sample. Conclusions: The risk factors for SARS and death in COVID-19 patients seeking health care, in order of relevance, were age, comorbidities, and socioeconomic factors, considering each discriminatory power.","Mafra, A.

As of 18 March 2020, a total number of 194909 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, including 7876 deaths, the majority of which have been reported in China (3242) and Italy (2505)(3). However, as the pandemic is still unfortunately under progression, there are limited data with regard to the clinical characteristics of the patients as well as to their prognostic factors(4). Smoking, to date, has been assumed to be possibly associated with adverse disease prognosis, as extensive evidence has highlighted the negative impact of tobacco use on lung health and its causal association with a plethora of respiratory diseases(5). Smoking is also detrimental to the immune system and its responsiveness to infections, making smokers more vulnerable to infectious diseases(6). Previous studies have shown that smokers are twice more likely than non-smokers to contract influenza and have more severe symptoms, while smokers were also noted to have higher mortality in the previous MERS-CoV outbreak(7,8). Given the gap in the evidence, we conducted a systematic review of studies on COVID-19 that included information on patients’ smoking status to evaluate the association between smoking and COVID-19 outcomes including the severity of the disease, the need for mechanical ventilation, the need for intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization and death. The literature search was conducted on 17 March 2020, using two databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect), with the search terms: [‘smoking’ OR ‘tobacco’ OR ‘risk factors’ OR ‘smoker*’] AND [‘COVID-19’ OR ‘COVID 19’ OR ‘novel coronavirus’ OR ‘sars cov-2’ OR ‘sars cov 2’] and included studies published in 2019 and 2020. Further inclusion criteria were that the studies were in English and referred to humans. We also searched the reference lists of the studies included. A total of 71 studies were retrieved through the search, of which 66 were excluded after full-text screening, leaving five studies that were included. All of the studies were conducted in China, four in Wuhan and one across provinces in mainland China. The populations in all studies were patients with COVID-19, and the sample size ranged from 41 to 1099 patients. With regard to the study design, retrospective and prospective methods were used, and the timeframe of all five studies covered the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic (December 2019, January 2020). Specifically, Zhou et al.(9) studied the epidemiological characteristics of 191 individuals infected with COVID-19, without, however, reporting in more detail the mortality risk factors and the clinical outcomes of the disease. Among the 191 patients, there were 54 deaths, while 137 survived. Among those that died, 9% were current smokers compared to 4% among those that survived, with no statistically significant difference between the smoking rates of survivors and non-survivors (p=0.21) with regard to mortality from COVID-19. Similarly, Zhang et al.(10) presented clinical characteristics of 140 patients with COVID-19. The results showed that among severe patients (n=58), 3.4% were current smokers and 6.9% were former smokers, in contrast to non-severe patients (n=82) among which 0% were current smokers and 3.7% were former smokers , leading to an OR of 2.23; (95% CI: 0.65–7.63; p=0.2). Huang et al.(11) studied the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 among 41 patients. In this study, none of those who needed to be admitted to an ICU (n=13) was a current smoker. In contrast, three patients from the non-ICU group were current smokers, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients (p=0.31), albeit the small sample size of the study. The largest study population of 1099 patients with COVID-19 was provided by Guan et al.(12) from multiple regions of mainland China. Descriptive results on the smoking status of patients were provided for the 1099 patients, of which 173 had severe symptoms, and 926 had non-severe symptoms. Among the patients with severe symptoms, 16.9% were current smokers and 5.2% were former smokers, in contrast to patients with non-severe symptoms where 11.8% were current smokers and 1.3% were former smokers. Additionally, in the group of patients that either needed mechanical ventilation, admission to an ICU or died, 25.5% were current smokers and 7.6% were former smokers. In contrast, in the group of patients that did not have these adverse outcomes, only 11.8% were current smokers and 1.6% were former smokers. No statistical analysis for evaluating the association between the severity of the disease outcome and smoking status was conducted in that study. Finally, Liu et al.(13) found among their population of 78 patients with COVID-19 that the adverse outcome group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking (27.3%) than the group that showed improvement or stabilization (3.0%), with this difference statistically significant at the p=0.018 level. In their multivariate logistic regression analysis, the history of smoking was a risk factor of disease progression (OR=14.28; 95% CI: 1.58–25.00; p= 0.018). We identified five studies that reported data on the smoking status of patients infected with COVID-19. Notably, in the largest study that assessed severity, there were higher percentages of current and former smokers among patients that needed ICU support, mechanical ventilation or who had died, and a higher percentage of smokers among the severe cases(12). However, from their published data we can calculate that the smokers were 1.4 times more likely (RR=1.4, 95% CI: 0.98–2.00) to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to be admitted to an ICU, need mechanical ventilation or die compared to non-smokers (RR=2.4, 95% CI: 1.43–4.04). In conclusion, although further research is warranted as the weight of the evidence increases, with the limited available data, and although the above results are unadjusted for other factors that may impact disease progression, smoking is most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19.","Vardavas, Constantine I.; Nikitara, Katerina",Tob Induc Dis,61,16

Forgetting to take medicines is one of the most common reasons for unintentional medication nonadherence. Research findings indicate that voice-activated virtual home assistants, such as Amazon Echo and Google Home devices, may be useful in promoting medication adherence. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to create a medication adherence app (skill), MedBuddy, for Amazon Echo devices and measure the use, usability, and usefulness of this medication-taking reminder skill. METHODS: A single-group, mixed methods, cohort feasibility study was conducted with women who took oral contraceptives (N=25). Participants were undergraduate students (age: mean 21.8 years, SD 6.2) at an urban university in the Southeast United States. Participants were given an Amazon Echo Dot with MedBuddy—a new medication reminder skill for Echo devices created by our team—attached to their study account, which they used for 60 days. Participants self-reported their baseline and poststudy medication adherence. MedBuddy use was objectively evaluated by tracking participants’ interactions with MedBuddy through Amazon Alexa. The usability and usefulness of MedBuddy were evaluated through a poststudy interview in which participants responded to both quantitative and qualitative questions. RESULTS: Participants’ interactions with MedBuddy, as tracked through Amazon Alexa, only occurred on half of the study days (mean 50.97, SD 29.5). At study end, participants reported missing their medication less in the past 1 and 6 months compared with baseline (χ(2)(1)=0.9 and χ(2)(1)=0.4, respectively; McNemar test: P<.001 for both). However, there was no significant difference in participants’ reported adherence to consistently taking medication within the same 2-hour time frame every day in the past 1 or 6 months at the end of the study compared with baseline (χ(2)(1)=3.5 and χ(2)(1)=0.4, respectively; McNemar test: P=.63 and P=.07, respectively). Overall feedback about usability was positive, and participants provided constructive feedback about the skill’s features that could be improved. Participants’ evaluation of MedBuddy’s usefulness was overwhelmingly positive—most (15/23, 65%) said that they would continue using MedBuddy as a medication reminder if provided with the opportunity and that they would recommend it to others. MedBuddy features that participants enjoyed were an external prompt separate from their phone, the ability to hear the reminder prompt from a separate room, multiple reminders, and verbal responses to prompts. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this feasibility study indicate that the MedBuddy medication reminder skill may be useful in promoting medication adherence. However, the skill could benefit from further usability enhancements.","Corbett, Cynthia F; Combs, Elizabeth M; Chandarana, Peyton S; Stringfellow, Isabel; Worthy, Karen; Nguyen, Thien; Wright, Pamela J; O'Kane, Jason M",JMIR Form Res,61,5

Mice survived acute encephalitis if more than 5 × 105 cells of either type of the virus-specific T cell clones had been transfered into H-2-matched recipients by 1 day post-infection. Although the adoptive transfer of both types of the T cell clones suppressed viral growth and viral antigen-positive cells in the brains, a significant inhibition of virus replication by the cytotoxic T cell clone was detected prior to that induced by the helper T cell clone. Histologically, cell destruction was prominent in the brains of mice which received the cytotoxic T cell clone. These results demonstrate that both the CD8+ cytotoxic T cell and the CD4+ helper T cell can protect mice from a lethal MHV-4 infection in the central nervous system.","Yamaguchi, Kenjiro; Goto, Naoaki; Kyuwa, Shigeru; Hayami, Masanori; Toyoda, Yutaka",Journal of Neuroimmunology,61,1

The active site region of SARS CoVMpro is divided into 8 subsites. Understanding the binding mode of SARS CoVMpro with a specific substrate is useful and contributes to structural-based drug design. The purpose of this research is to investigate the binding mode between the SARS CoVMpro and two octapeptides, especially in the region of the S3 subsite, through a molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approach. RESULTS: The one turn α-helix chain (residues 47–54) of the SARS CoVMpro was directly involved in the induced-fit model of the enzyme-substrate complex. The S3 subsite of the enzyme had a negatively charged region due to the presence of Glu47. During MD simulations, Glu47 of the enzyme was shown to play a key role in electrostatic bonding with the P3Lys of the octapeptide. CONCLUSION: MD simulations were carried out on the SARS CoVMpro-octapeptide complex. The hypothesis proposed that Glu47 of SARS CoVMpro is an important residue in the S3 subsite and is involved in binding with P3Lys of the octapeptide.","Phakthanakanok, Krongsakda; Ratanakhanokchai, Khanok; Kyu, Khin Lay; Sompornpisut, Pornthep; Watts, Aaron; Pinitglang, Surapong",BMC Bioinformatics,61,24

We aimed to examine prolonged length of in‐hospital stay (LOS) due to Covid‐19 among patients with lymphoma and assess its determinants and outcomes. Adult patients with lymphoma admitted for Covid‐19 to 16 French hospitals in March and April, 2020 were included. Length of in‐hospital stay was analyzed as a competitor vs death. The study included 111 patients. The median age was 65 years (range, 19–92). Ninety‐four patients (85%) had B‐cell non‐Hodgkin lymphoma. Within the 12 months prior to hospitalization for Covid‐19, 79 patients (71%) were treated for their lymphoma. Among them, 63 (57%) received an anti‐CD20 therapy. Fourteen patients (12%) had relapsed/refractory disease. The median LOS was 14 days (range, 1–235). After a median follow‐up of 191 days (3–260), the 6‐month overall survival was 69%. In multivariable analyses, recent administration of anti‐CD20 therapy was associated with prolonged LOS (subdistribution hazard ratio 2.26, 95% confidence interval 1.42–3.6, p < 0.001) and higher risk of death (hazard ratio 2.17, 95% confidence interval 1.04–4.52, p = 0.039). An age ≥ 70 years and relapsed/refractory lymphoma were also associated with prolonged LOS and decreased overall survival. In conclusion, an age ≥ 70 years, a relapsed/refractory lymphoma and recent administration of anti‐CD20 therapy are risk factors for prolonged LOS and death for lymphoma patients hospitalized for Covid‐19. These findings may contribute to guide the management of lymphoma during the pandemic, support evaluating specific therapeutic approaches, and raise questions on the efficacy and timing of vaccination of this particular population.","Duléry, Rémy; Lamure, Sylvain; Delord, Marc; Di Blasi, Roberta; Chauchet, Adrien; Hueso, Thomas; Rossi, Cédric; Drenou, Bernard; Deau Fischer, Bénédicte; Soussain, Carole; Feugier, Pierre; Noël, Nicolas; Choquet, Sylvain; Bologna, Serge; Joly, Bertrand; Philippe, Laure; Kohn, Milena; Malak, Sandra; Fouquet, Guillemette; Daguindau, Etienne; Taoufik, Yassine; Lacombe, Karine; Cartron, Guillaume; Thiéblemont, Catherine; Besson, Caroline",Am J Hematol,61,3

We hypothesise that foreskin tissue samples of asymptomatic HSV-2 seropositive men had remaining signs of inflammation at the molecular level. Even in the absence of clinical lesions, genital inflammation may contribute to increased HIV susceptibility on sexual exposure to the virus. SETTING: Foreskin tissue samples were collected from men undergoing elective circumcision in Kisumu, Kenya. PARTICIPANTS: The foreskin tissue samples (n=86) were stratified into study groups based on HSV-2 serology and assessed for mRNA expression of inflammatory markers. Markers of interest were further assessed by immunohistochemical staining within the tissue samples. RESULTS: The two study groups had comparable levels of all molecular markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD69, CCR5, HLA-DR, Langerin, DC-SIGN, Mannose Receptor 1, IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, β7, IgA, IFN-α, CCL5, E-cadherin, ZO-1 and occludin), except for lower mRNA levels of the epithelial junction protein claudin-1 in the HSV-2 seropositive group (p=0.008). Although mRNA levels of claudin-1 were lower in HSV-2 seropositive individuals, the corresponding protein could be visualised in the foreskin epithelium of all samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas no general inflammation was demonstrated in the foreskin of asymptomatic HSV-2 seropositive individuals, a decreased expression of claudin-1 indicates a less robust genital epithelial barrier. An intact epithelial barrier is essential for blocking mucosal entry of genital infections, including HIV.","Röhl, Maria; Tjernlund, Annelie; Mehta, Supriya D; Pettersson, Pernilla; Bailey, Robert C; Broliden, Kristina",BMJ Open,61,5

Substantial research has been conducted to assess viability of the virus on surfaces of vehicles and equipment, in feed and water, and on production building surfaces, but little is known about the persistence in PEDV-infected carcasses and effective disposal methods thereof. This study was conducted to quantify the persistence of PEDV RNA via quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) at various time-temperature combinations and in infected piglet carcasses subjected to composting. Although this method does not distinguish between infectious and noninfectious virus, it is a rapid and sensitive test to evaluate materials for evidence of virus genome. RESULTS: In the first study, PEDV was suspended in cell culture media at 1 × 10(5) TCID50 per sample (1 mL sample size) and subjected to various time and temperature combinations in triplicate including temperatures of 37, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70 °C and exposure times of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 14 days. At all temperatures, viral RNA copies declined over time, with the decline most marked and rapid at 65 and 70 °C. Detectable RNA did persist throughout the trial in all but the most extreme condition, where two of three samples incubated at 70 °C yielded undetectable viral RNA after 14 days. In the second study, PEDV-infected piglet carcasses were subjected to two cycles of composting lasting 36 and 37 days, respectively, for a total compost time of 73 days. Composting was performed in triplicate windrow sections housed inside biosecure, climate-controlled rooms using insulated bins designed to represent a continuous windrow compost pile. Temperatures reached 35–57 °C for 26 days of cycle 1 and 35–45 °C for 3 days of cycle 2. Samples consisting of carbon material with or without decomposed tissue as available per sample site collected at ten locations throughout the cross-section of each windrow section following the primary and secondary compost cycles yielded no detectable viral RNA. CONCLUSIONS: Composting appears to be an effective disposal method for PEDV-infected piglet carcasses under the conditions examined. The combination of time and high temperature of the compost cycle effectively degraded viral RNA in cell culture media that should provide optimum stability. Complex compost material matrices collected from windrow sections yielded undetectable PEDV RNA by qRT-PCR after one 36-day compost cycle despite incomplete decomposition of soft tissue.","Vitosh-Sillman, Sarah; Loy, John Dustin; Brodersen, Bruce; Kelling, Clayton; Eskridge, Kent; Millmier Schmidt, Amy",Porcine Health Manag,61,28

METHODS: We evaluated the test-ordering practices for 2 commonly utilized nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for the detection of respiratory pathogens: the Xpert Flu Assay for influenza A/B (Flu assay) and the Biofire FilmArray respiratory panel assay (RP assay), which detects 20 different targets. Our study examined repeat testing; that is, testing within 7 days from an initial test. RESULTS: Our study found that repeat testing is common for each of the individual assays: 3.0% of all Flu assays and 10.0% of all RP assays were repeat testing. Of repeat testing, 8/293 (2.7%) of repeat Flu assays and 75/1257 (6.0%) of RP assays resulted diagnostic gains, i.e., new detections. However, for the RP assay, these new detections were not always clinically actionable. The most frequently discrepant organisms were rhinovirus/enterovirus (28/102, 27.5%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (12/102, 11.8%) and coronavirus OC43 (11/102, 10.8%). Furthermore, there were 3,336 instances in which a patient was tested using both a Flu assay and RP assay, of which only 44 (1.3%) had discrepant influenza results. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest opportunities exist to better guide ordering practices for respiratory pathogen testing, including limiting repeat testing, with the goal of optimization of clinical yield, and diagnostic stewardship.","Qavi, Abraham J; McMullen, Allison; Burnham, Carey-Ann D; Anderson, Neil W",J Appl Lab Med,61,24

We aimed to perform a constant, detailed assessment of cortical development in IMVM fetuses using ultrasound and determine whether asymmetric cortical development occurred. Moreover, we aimed to estimate the prognosis of IMVM fetuses and compare the difference in the prognosis of IMVM fetuses presenting symmetric and asymmetric cortical maturation. METHODS: IMVM was diagnosed by regular ultrasound, neurosonography and fetal MRI. Genetic and TORCH examinations were conducted to exclude common genetic abnormalities and TORCH infection of fetuses. Ultrasound examinations were conducted at an interval of 2–3 weeks to record sulcus development in IMVM fetuses using a scoring system. The neonatal behavioral neurological assessment (NBNA), the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Third Edition (ASQ-3) and the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, First Edition (BSID-I) were performed after birth. RESULTS: Forty fetuses with IMVM were included: twenty showed asymmetric cortical maturation and twenty showed symmetric cortical maturation. For IMVM fetuses presenting asymmetric cortical maturation, the mean gestational age (GA) at the first diagnosis of relatively delayed development was 24.23 weeks for the parieto-occipital sulcus, 24.71 weeks for the calcarine sulcus, and 26.43 weeks for the cingulate sulcus. All the sulci with delayed development underwent ‘catch-up growth’ and developed to the same grade as the sulci of the other hemisphere. The mean GA at which the two sides developed to the same grade was 29.40 weeks for the parieto-occipital sulcus, 29.30 weeks for the calcarine sulcus and 31.27 weeks for the cingulate sulcus. The NBNA, ASQ-3 and BSID-I scores of all patients were in the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: IMVM fetuses may show mild asymmetric cortical maturation in the second trimester, but the relatively delayed sulci undergo ‘catch-up growth’. The neurodevelopment of IMVM fetuses presenting asymmetric cortical maturation and ‘catch-up growth’ is not statistically significantly different from IMVM fetuses presenting symmetric cortical maturation.","Zhu, Rong; Chen, Jun Ya; Hou, Xin Lin; Liu, Li Li; Sun, Guo Yu",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,61,24

In this regard, a comparative study was carried out that describes this phenomenon over a period of six months on three social networks: YouTube, Twitter and Instagram, with a sample composed of specialized health media versus healthcare professionals. The results point to a new communications model that opens up a new space for agents whose content has a degree of engagement comparable to and even exceeding that of digital media specialized in health communication.

However, the efficiency, feasibility and difficulties faced by anaesthesiologist while performing endotracheal intubations under barrier devices require scientific validation. This manikin-based pilot study aims to assess the laryngoscopic performances of experienced anaesthesiologists under two different barrier enclosures. METHODS AND MATERIALS: 53 anaesthesiologists (14 Consultants and 39 Senior Residents) who were undergoing an airway training module as a part of preparedness for handling the COVID 19 pandemic were recruited. Using an aerosol box over a manikin, the participants attempted intubation using a Glidescope Videolaryngoscope and Macintosh laryngoscopes (GA and MA Groups). Subsequently, intubation was attempted under a transparent plastic sheet using both laryngoscopes (GP and MP groups). Time required for intubation, first pass success rates, subjective ease of intubation and the feedback obtained from the participants were recorded and analysed. RESULTS: Time required for accomplishing successful intubation was 38.55 ± 12.16 seconds, 26.58 ± 5.73 seconds, 46.89 ± 15.23 seconds and 37.26 ± 8.71 seconds for GA, MA, GP and MP groups respectively.

Clinicians require an understanding of this phenomenon and various risk stratification approaches for recognizing these subjects. METHODS: We examined all Covid-19 patients sent initially to a ward who subsequently required care in the ICU. We examined the timing transfer and attempted to develop a risk score based on baseline variables to predict progressive disease. We evaluated the utility of the CURB-65 score at identifying the need for ICU transfer. RESULTS: The cohort included 245 subjects (mean age 59.0 ± 14.2 years, 61.2% male) and 20% were eventually sent to the ICU. The median time to transfer was 2.5 days. Approximately 1/3rd of patients were not moved until day 4 or later and the main reason for transfer (79.2%) was worsening respiratory failure. A baseline absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of ≤0.8 10(3)/ml and a serum ferritin ≥1000 ng/ml were independently associated with ICU transfer. Co-morbid illnesses did not correlate with eventual ICU care. Neither a risk score based on a low ALC and/or high ferritin nor the CURB-65 score performed well at predicting need for transfer. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 patients admitted to general wards face a significant risk for deterioration necessitating ICU admission and respiratory failure can occur late in this disease. Neither baseline clinical factors nor the CURB-65 score perform well as screening tests to categorize these subjects as likely to progress to ICU care.","Hashmi, Muhammad Daniyal; Alnababteh, Muhtadi; Vedantam, Karthik; Alunikummannil, Jojo; Oweis, Emil S.; Shorr, Andrew F.",Respir Med,61,26

The aim of this study was to investigate the mid-term mental health outcomes in patients recovered from COVID-19, 3–4 months after discharge from the University Hospital Maggiore della Carità, Novara, Italy. Furthermore, we investigated the possible association of the mid-term mental health consequences of the COVID-19 infection with patients' clinical current status, persistent physical impairment and severity of acute phase of the disease. Methods: Prospective study involving 238 individuals recovered from COVID-19. In the context of a multi-disciplinary approach, patients' assessment included both a clinical interview performed by an experienced psychiatrist, trained in the use of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview to assess the presence of anxiety and depressive symptoms and self-administered questionnaires: Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Resilience Scale for Adults (RSA), Impact of Event Scale (IES). Results: At the psychiatric assessment 32.9 and 29.5% of participants showed anxiety and depressive symptoms, respectively. Changes in appetite and sleep patterns emerged for 15.6 and 31.2% of patients. According to the self-administered questionnaires, 7.1% of participants had moderate-severe anxiety levels (BAI), while 10.5% had mild to severe depression (BDI-II). Twenty-six (11%) participants were referred to further psychiatric consultation. Psychiatric symptoms showed no correlation with acute COVID-19 severity; in our sample patients with depressive symptoms at the clinical interview, as well as those with mild to severe levels of depression according to BDI-II scores, had lower forced expiratory volume in the 1st second (FEV1) values than those without and greater odds for persistent, poor tolerance for physical efforts. Conclusions: As could be expected, an approach including both a psychiatric interview and the use of self-administered questionnaires is likely to capture the psychiatric outcome of patients recovered from COVID-19 better than questionnaires alone. Anxiety and depressive symptoms at follow-up had no correlation with the severity of COVID acute manifestations, but rather with ongoing and persistent physical symptoms. Further studies and longer follow-up duration will allow a better understanding of the complex relationship between residual physical symptoms, quality of life and psychological health.","Gramaglia, Carla; Gambaro, Eleonora; Bellan, Mattia; Balbo, Piero Emilio; Baricich, Alessio; Sainaghi, Pier Paolo; Pirisi, Mario; Baldon, Giulia; Battistini, Sofia; Binda, Valeria; Feggi, Alessandro; Gai, Martina; Gattoni, Eleonora; Jona, Amalia; Lorenzini, Luca; Marangon, Debora; Martelli, Maria; Prosperini, Pierluigi; Zeppegno, Patrizia",Front Psychiatry,61,2

To start to define these risks, in a systematic manner, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the abdominal fluid and lower genital tract of patients undergoing surgery. DESIGN: A prospective cross sectional observational study. SETTING: A single large UK Hospital PATIENTS: O 113 patients undergoing abdominal surgery or instrumentation of the lower genital tract. INTERVENTIONS: We took COVID swabs from the peritoneal cavity and from the vagina from all eligible patients. Results were stratified by pre operative COVID status. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In patients who were presumed COVID negative at the time of surgery SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA was detected in 0/102 peritoneal samples and 0/98 vaginal samples. Both cohorts included four patients who were antibody positive but nasopharyngeal sab test negative at the time of surgery. Peritoneal and vaginal swabs were also negative in one patient who had a positive nasopharyngeal swab immediately prior to surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the abdominal fluid or lower genital tract of presumed negative patients is nil or extremely low.

Data from the parent study were included in this analysis if it addressed availability and use of PPE in the clinical setting. Conventional content analysis was used on data including: field notes documenting nurse practice, semi-structured interview transcripts, and photographs. FINDINGS Data from the majority of participants (32/37) and all facilities (12/12) in the parent studies were included. 83% of facilities reported limited PPE. Five management strategies for coping with limited PPE supplies were observed, reported, or both: rationing PPE, self-purchasing PPE, asking patients to purchase PPE, substituting PPE, and working without PPE. Approaches to rationing PPE included using PPE only for symptomatic patients or not performing physical exams. Substitutions for PPE were based on supply availability. CONCLUSIONS Strategies developed by clinicians to manage low PPE likely have negative consequences for both workers and patients; further research into the topic is important, as is better PPE provision in low-income countries.","Ridge, Laura Jean; Stimpfel, Amy Witkoski; Dickson, Victoria Vaughan; Klar, Robin Toft; Squires, Allison Patricia",American journal of infection control,61,1

For that purpose, clinical trials have to be carried out as per international ethical standards. The current study was undertaken to examine the willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and to determine factors that might affect their decision to participate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey study was carried out among the public in Jordan. During the study period, a convenience sample of adults (aged 18 years or above) were asked to participate via an online self-administered survey that was designed to evaluate the willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and to determine factors affecting their decision to participate. RESULTS: Results showed that, among participants (n=1,287), 36.1% reported to be willing to participate in clinical trials of the vaccine. Additionally, a lower percentage (18.1%) were willing to allow their children to participate. Motivators that encourage participation were the desire to return to normal life (73.2%), followed by the desire to help in finding a treatment for COVID-19 infection (68.1%). Barriers towards the participation were not wanting to be challenged by the virus (54.7%), fear (40.7%), lack of time (40.4%), and mistrust in pharmaceutical companies (38.9%). Finally, results showed that higher educational level was associated with lower willingness to participate (P=0.001), whereas having a previous participation in clinical studies is associated with a significantly higher willingness to participate in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: A good portion of Jordanians are positive regarding participation in clinical studies of COVID-19 vaccine. Educational level and previous participation in clinical studies were among the determinants of such willingness. In addition, fear and lack of time were among the barriers of participation.","Abu-Farha, Rana K; Alzoubi, Karem H; Khabour, Omar F",Patient Prefer Adherence,61,1

Multidisciplinary pediatric weight management programs have been deemed effective. However, effectiveness of these programs is impacted by attrition, limiting health benefits to children, and inefficiently utilizing scarce resources. METHODS: We have developed a model (the Outcomes Forecasting System, OFS) that isolates variables associated with attrition from pediatric weight management, with the potential to forecast participant dropout. In Aim 1, we will increase the power and precision of the OFS and then validate the model through the consistent acquisition of key patient, family, and treatment data, from three different weight management sites. In Aim 2, external validity will be established through the application of the OFS at a fourth pediatric weight management program. Aim 3 will be a pilot clinical trial, incorporating an intervention built on the results of Aims 1 and 2 and utilizing the OFS to reduce attrition. DISCUSSION: A greater understanding of the patient, family, and disease-specific factors that predict dropout from pediatric weight management can be utilized to prevent attrition. The goal of the current study is to refine the OFS to a level of precision and efficiency to be a valuable tool to any weight management program. By identifying the most pertinent factors driving attrition across weight management sites, new avenues for treatment will be identified. This study will result in a valuable forecasting tool that will be applicable for diverse programs and populations, decrease program costs, and improve patient retention, adherence, and outcomes.

The time spent at home significantly surged during the pandemic and this change in occupancy can have a direct impact on building energy consumption. COVID-19 lockdowns also accelerated the transition towards telework, a trend that many expect to last. Changes in energy consumption under lockdown is thus a valuable asset to forecast how energy could be consumed in buildings in the future. Here, we aim to quantify the impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on the energy consumption (electricity, hot water and space heating) in residential buildings by answering these two questions: (i) Did the lockdown lead to changes in total energy consumption?, and (ii) Did the lockdown lead to changes in consumption patterns (i.e. time of the day at which energy is consumed)? To do so, we compared the energy consumption measured in a 40-dwelling social housing building located in Quebec City (Canada) during four months of lockdown to those of the months that preceded the lockdown. It is found that consumption patterns for electricity and hot water changed for the first two months of the lockdown, when the most intensive lockdown measures were applied. Overall consumption slightly increased for these two energy expenditures, but the more important change was that consumption occurred throughout the day instead of being concentrated in the evening as observed before the lockdown. Results shed light on the impact of lockdown on energy bills for consumers and on how energy utilities might be solicited during this kind of episode.","Rouleau, Jean; Gosselin, Louis",Appl Energy,61,24

However, cancer patients continue to be one of the most affected. We evaluate the mortality rate due to COVID-19 and associated risk factors in the cancer population diagnosed in our center during the first year of pandemic. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 189 cancer patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 between March 5, 2020 and February 28, 2021. Mortality rate nd associated risk factors were studied. Results: Mortality rate: 55/189 patients. Mean age: 72 years (34-95), 125/189 male patients. Predominant histologies: lung cancer (72/189), colorectal (31/189), breast (24/189). Predominant staging: metastatic disease (113/189). Predominant cancer treatment: chemotherapy (63/189);118/189 patients were receiving any type of oncological treatment with palliative intention. Mortality was associated with male gender (45/55 vs 10/55, p=0.004), presence of comorbidities (48/55 vs 7/55, p=0.01), lung cancer (28/72 deaths with this tumor vs 27/117 with the rest, p=0.02), palliative intention cancer treatment (41/55 vs 12/55, p=0.02), older median age (76 vs 71, p = 0.02), higher median CRP (p=115.6 mg/dl vs 46 mg/dl), lower median lymphocytes (600/mm3 vs 1000/mm3 p<0.001). No specific treatment against COVID-19 significantly decreased mortality. Neither IL-6 nor ferritin were prognostic biomarkers. In multivariate analysis, male gender (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.1-5.9, p = 0.02), lung cancer (OR 2.0, CI 1.0-3.8, p = 0.03), cancer treatment with palliative intention (OR 2.4, CI 1.07-5.3, p = 0.03), higher median CRP (OR 1.0, CI 1.00-1.01, p <0.001), as well as low lymphocyte median (OR 0.5, CI 0.25-1.0, p = 0.56), continued to be evidenced as risk factors, regardless of comorbidities, staging, sex, and palliative intention cancer-specific treatment, among other variables. Conclusions: Men with lung cancer under cancer-specific treatment with palliative intention who present, at the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection with elevated CRP above 115 mg/dl and a decrease in lymphocytes below 600/mm3 have a higher risk of presenting fatal complications.

This study investigated the psychological impact of COVID‐19 on healthcare workers in China Xi'an Center hospital. METHODS: A modified online questionnaire of Psychological Status and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ‐12) was provided to 1,967 healthcare workers during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Participation was voluntary, and the responses were anonymous. The survey lasted for 2 weeks, and the GHQ‐12 was completed every other day. The data were collected automatically and electronically and then statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The 431 (21.9%) responders included 214 nurses (49.7%), 146 clinicians (33.9%), 29 pharmacists (6.7%), 15 medical technicians (3.5%), 17 administrative staff (3.9%), and 10 other departments (2.3%). Of these, 46.2% had 10 years of work experiences or more and 78.2% were married. Work experience increased emotional stress as 23% of participants with 10 years or more of experience exhibited higher stress compared to those with fewer than 3 years of work experience (7.5%). Moreover, 33.3% of participants who worked in or were exposed to the affected areas of the pandemic experienced psychological stress. Overall, this study identified four factors that were significantly associated with psychological stress: (a) work experience (OR 2.99; 95% CI: 1.06 to 8.41); (b) change in job position (OR 1.99; 95% CI: 1.10 to 3.59); (c) change in lifestyle (OR 4.06; 95% CI: 1.81 to 9.10); and (d) need for psychological counseling (OR 3.07; 95% CI: 1.62 to 5.82).

The protein expressed at a yield of ∼80-100 mg/liter in transiently transfected Expi293 cells, as well as CHO and HEK293 stable cell lines and formed homogeneous disulfide-linked trimers. When lyophilized, these possessed remarkable functional stability to transient thermal stress of upto 100 °C and were stable to long term storage of over 4 weeks at 37 °C unlike an alternative RBD-trimer with a different trimerization domain. Two intramuscular immunizations with a human-compatible SWE adjuvanted formulation, elicited antibodies with pseudoviral neutralizing titers in guinea pigs and mice that were 25-250 fold higher than corresponding values in human convalescent sera. Against the beta (B.1.351) variant of concern (VOC), pseudoviral neutralization titers for RBD trimer were ∼ three-fold lower than against wildtype B.1 virus. RBD was also displayed on a designed ferritin-like Msdps2 nanoparticle. This showed decreased yield and immunogenicity relative to trimeric RBD. Replicative virus neutralization assays using mouse sera demonstrated that antibodies induced by the trimers neutralized all four VOC to date, namely B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and B.1.617.2 without significant differences.

Patients are unaware of their rights, lacking control of health care treatments they might deserve. This can contribute to sustaining inequality as well as failure in achieving welfare policy goals. Drawing on channel complementarity theory, the current study explored patients’ awareness toward their rights, and the credibility of information sources related to patient rights. In a web-based survey, 994 Israeli participants, suffering from chronic illness and using health services, were recruited. To examine the study’s theoretical framework and relationships among the constructs and test the hypotheses, a path analysis was conducted using Structural Equation Modeling. The research model depicts direct and indirect relationships between constructs, and the relevant coefficients. The results show a direct and positive interaction between information credibility and patient rights awareness (β = 0.10, p = 0.019). Information credibility partially mediates the relationship between public service information sources and patient rights awareness (bootstrap with 95% CI: 0.01–0.07; p = 0.015). The mass media information sources construct is directly and positively related to information credibility (β = 0.36, p = 0.000). Age was found as a moderator, indicating that information credibility is a factor only at lower ages. Therefore, patient rights should be systematically and reliably accessible in order to raise the awareness and trust of chronic patients regarding information about patient rights. Using planned health communication campaigns mainly via public service sources that are perceived as trustworthy can help contribute to approach patients more effectively and provide them with accessible and detailed information about their rights.","Roth-Cohen, Osnat; Levy, Shalom; Zigdon, Avi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,61,16

Although experts began to recognize it as a public health crisis prior to 2020, the novel coronavirus pandemic has accelerated recognition of social isolation as a serious threat to health and well-being. OBJECTIVE: Examine patient experiences with screening and assistance for social isolation in primary care settings, and whether patient experiences with these activities are associated with the severity of reported social isolation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey conducted in 2018. PARTICIPANTS: Adults (N = 251) were recruited from 3 primary care clinics in Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco. MAIN MEASURES: A modified version of the Berkman-Syme Social Network Index (SNI), endorsed by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine; items to assess for prior experiences with screening and assistance for social isolation. KEY RESULTS: In the sample population, 12.4% reported the highest levels of social isolation (SNI = 0/1), compared to 36.7%, 34.7%, and 16.3% (SNI = 2–4, respectively). Most patients had not been asked about social isolation in a healthcare setting (87.3%), despite reporting no discomfort with social isolation screening (93.9%). Neither discomfort with nor participation in prior screening for social isolation was associated with social isolation levels. Desire for assistance with social isolation (3.2%) was associated with a higher level of social isolation (AOR = 6.0, 95% CI, 1.3–28.8), as well as poor or fair health status (AOR = 9.1; 95% CI, 1.3–64.1). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, few patients reported being screened previously for social isolation in a primary care setting, despite low levels of discomfort with screening. Providers should consider broadening social isolation screening and referral practices in healthcare settings, especially among sicker and more isolated patients who express higher levels of interest in assistance with social isolation.

However, their inherent high sensitivity is always accompanied by a low selectivity. Chemical functionalization of two-dimensional materials has emerged as a promising way to overcome the selectivity issues. Here, we demonstrate efficient graphene functionalization with carbohydrate ligands—chitooligomers, which bind proteins of the lectin family with high selectivity. Successful grafting of a chitooligomer library was thoroughly characterized, and glycan binding to wheat germ agglutinin was studied by a series of methods. The results demonstrate that the protein quaternary structure remains intact after binding to the functionalized graphene, and that the lectin can be liberated from the surface by the addition of a binding competitor. The chemoenzymatic assay with a horseradish peroxidase conjugate also confirmed the intact catalytic properties of the enzyme. The present approach thus paves the way towards graphene-based sensors for carbohydrate–lectin binding.","Koukalová, Tereza; Kovaříček, Petr; Bojarová, Pavla; Guerra, Valentino L.

Usually, the disease remains undiagnosed throughout the patient’s life, due to its frequent asymptomatic course. If symptomatic, sIgAD is connected to more frequent viral and bacterial infections of upper respiratory, urinary, and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as autoimmune and allergic diseases. Interestingly, it may also be associated with other PIDs, such as IgG subclasses deficiency or specific antibodies deficiency. Rarely sIgAD can evolve to common variable immunodeficiency disease (CVID). It should also be remembered that IgA deficiency may occur in the course of other conditions or result from their treatment. It is hypothesized that allergic diseases (e.g., eczema, rhinitis, asthma) are more common in patients diagnosed with this particular PID. Selective IgA deficiency, although usually mildly symptomatic, can be difficult for clinicians.

By developing highly sensitive and specific trimeric spike (S)-based antibody tests, we report IgM, IgG and IgA responses to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients (n=105) representing different categories of disease severity. All patients surveyed were IgG positive against S. Elevated anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels were associated with hospitalization, with IgA titers, increased circulating IL-6 and strong neutralizing responses indicative of intensive care status. Antibody-positive blood donors and pregnant women sampled during the pandemic in Stockholm, Sweden (weeks 14-25), displayed on average lower titers and weaker neutralizing responses compared to patients; however, inter-individual anti-viral IgG titers differed up to 1,000-fold. To provide more accurate estimates of seroprevalence, given the frequency of weak responders and the limitations associated with the dichotomization of a continuous variable (3,4), we used a Bayesian approach to assign likelihood of past infection without setting an assay cut-off. Analysis of blood donors (n=1,000) and pregnant women (n=900) sampled weekly demonstrated SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG in 7.2% (95% Bayesian CI [5.1-9.5]) of individuals two months after the peak of spring 2020 COVID-19 deaths.

In Cape Town, such a community-orientated primary care (COPC) approach was developed at four learning sites. Community health workers registered and assessed the households they were responsible for, but a year later the data were not analysed or converted into useful information. The aim was to analyse the household data and evaluate its contribution to a community diagnosis, its quality and any implications for the performance of CHWs. METHODS: This article used descriptive secondary analysis of household data collected by CHWs at three COPC learning sites in Cape Town (Nomzamo, Eastridge and Mamre). RESULTS: Data were analysed for 16 852 people from Eastridge, 1338 people from Mamre and 1008 people from Nomzamo. Data were compared in terms of household composition and demographics, type of dwelling, identification of people on treatment for chronic conditions, identification of health risks (e.g. tuberculosis symptoms, tobacco smoking, missed immunisations, missed vitamin A prophylaxis, need for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing or family planning, pregnant or postnatal, and wound care) and for referrals. CONCLUSION: Household assessment visits have great potential. Data collected is currently of poor quality, inconsistent or not captured, infrequently analysed and not comprehensive. There is a need to introduce an electronic m-health solution to assist the health information system, to revise the contents of the household assessment form and to ensure that CHWs are competent to identify risks and respond appropriately.","Mash, Robert; Du Pisanie, Louiso; Swart, Carla; van der Merwe, Ella",S Afr Fam Pract (2004),61,10

We seek to understand if these pandemic-related behaviors impact subsequent mental health. METHODS: Daily online survey data were collected on adults during May/June 2020. Measures were of daily physical and virtual (online) contact with others; substance and media use; and indices of psychological striving, struggling and COVID-related worry. Using random-intercept cross-lagged panel analysis, dynamic within-person cross-lagged effects were separated from more static individual differences. RESULTS: In total, 1148 participants completed daily surveys [657 (57.2%) females, 484 (42.1%) males; mean age 40.6 (s.d. 12.4) years]. Daily increases in news consumed increased COVID-related worrying the next day [cross-lagged estimate = 0.034 (95% CI 0.018–0.049), FDR-adjusted p = 0.00005] and vice versa [0.03 (0.012–0.048), FDR-adjusted p = 0.0017]. Increased media consumption also exacerbated subsequent psychological struggling [0.064 (0.03–0.098), FDR-adjusted p = 0.0005]. There were no significant cross-lagged effects of daily changes in social distancing or virtual contact on later mental health. CONCLUSIONS: We delineate a cycle wherein a daily increase in media consumption results in a subsequent increase in COVID-related worries, which in turn increases daily media consumption. Moreover, the adverse impact of news extended to broader measures of psychological struggling. A similar dynamic did not unfold between the daily amount of physical or virtual contact and subsequent mental health. Findings are consistent with current recommendations to moderate news and media consumption in order to promote mental health.","Shaw, Philip; Blizzard, Sam; Shastri, Gauri; Kundzicz, Paul; Curtis, Brenda; Ungar, Lyle; Koehly, Laura",Psychological Medicine,61,1

It is therefore not surprising that a steadily growing body of research and clinical reports now supports the use of FDG PET/CT to diagnose a wide range of patients with non-oncological diseases. However, using FDG PET/CT in patients with infectious or inflammatory diseases has some limitations and potential pitfalls that are not necessarily as pronounced in oncology FDG PET/CT. Some of these limitations are of a general nature and related to the laborious acquisition of PET images in patients that are often acutely ill, whereas others are more disease-specific and related to the particular metabolism in some of the organs most commonly affected by infections or inflammatory disease. Both inflammatory and infectious diseases are characterized by a more diffuse and less pathognomonic pattern of FDG uptake than oncology FDG PET/CT and the affected organs also typically have some physiological FDG uptake. In addition, patients referred to PET/CT with suspected infection or inflammation are rarely treatment naïve and may have received varying doses of antibiotics, corticosteroids or other immune-modulating drugs at the time of their examination. Combined, this results in a higher rate of false positive FDG findings and also in some cases a lower sensitivity to detect active disease. In this review, we therefore discuss the limitations and pitfalls of FDG PET/CT to diagnose infections and inflammation taking these issues into consideration. Our review encompasses the most commonly encountered inflammatory and infectious diseases in head and neck, in the cardiovascular system, in the abdominal organs and in the musculoskeletal system. Finally, new developments in the field of PET/CT that may help overcome some of these limitations are briefly highlighted.","Pijl, Jordy P; Nienhuis, Pieter H; Kwee, Thomas C; Glaudemans, Andor W J M; Slart, Riemer H J A; Gormsen, Lars C",Seminars in nuclear medicine,61,3

Recombinant IBVs based on the Beaudette strain expressing the Beaudette spike protein (Beau-R) or that from the virulent M41 strain (BeauR-M41(S)) were assessed for their potential as prototype vaccines for application to 18-day-old embryos. Pathogenicity was assessed by observing the effect on hatchability, and/or the production of nasal discharge and/or the effects on ciliary activity in the trachea at various time points post hatch. In contrast to commercial IBV vaccines given in ovo, the Beau-R and BeauR-M41(S) strains did not reduce hatchability or cause nasal discharge, and caused minimal damage to the ciliated epithelium of the trachea. The presence of the spike protein from a virulent virus did not increase the pathogenicity of the virus according to the criteria used. Assessment of the BeauR-M41(S) strain for efficacy showed that it protected up to 90% of chicks against challenge with virulent IB virus (M41) in a dose dependent manner. Further egg passage of the BeauR-M41(S) strain (BeauR-M41(S) EP10) did not increase its pathogenicity though it did improve its efficacy, based on serology and protection against a virulent challenge. BeauR-M41(S) EP10 was more efficacious than BeauR-M41(S) protecting more birds against virulent challenge and providing a better serological antibody response. BeauR-M41(S) EP10 induced a serological response similar to that of a commercial vaccine given at day-old though the commercial vaccine provided slightly higher efficacy. These results are promising for the development of embryo safe efficacious IBV vaccines for in ovo application.","Tarpey, I.; Orbell, S.J.; Britton, P.; Casais, R.; Hodgson, T.; Lin, F.; Hogan, E.; Cavanagh, D.",Vaccine,61,16

FGL2 is overexpressed in glioma, and its expression level is negatively associated with the prognosis of glioma patients. However, the diagnostic value of FGL2 is unknown in breast carcinoma. MATERIAL/METHODS: We comprehensively analyzed the expression pattern of FGL2 in breast cancer. Several online databases – TCGA, Oncomine, GEPIA, Kaplan-Meier plotter, and PrognoScan – were used in this study. RESULTS: Based on the TCGA dataset and Oncomine database, we found that the expression level of FGL2 was remarkably lower in breast cancer compared with adjacent normal tissues. Clinical data showed that the expression level of FGL2 was significantly associated with radiation therapy, PR status, and tumor stage. Bioinformatics analysis of the GEPIA, Kaplan-Meier plotter, and PrognoScan databases showed that lower FGL2 expression levels were associated with a worse prognosis in breast cancer patients. Furthermore, the expression level of FGL2 was positively correlated with the immune cell infiltrations in breast cancer, especially those cells with high antitumor activities. GO, KEGG, and GSEA analyses also validated that FGL2 was closely related to genes involved in the immune response, signal transduction, and T cell receptor signaling pathway in breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that high expression of FGL2 is a useful marker for breast cancer treatment and appears to be correlated with enhanced antitumor activities in breast cancer patients.","Feng, Yanyan; Guo, Chunguang; Wang, Hesong; Zhao, Lu; Wang, Wei; Wang, Ting; Feng, Yuyin; Yuan, Kai; Huang, Guangrui",Med Sci Monit,61,1
