The technique unveiled the complex network of interactions between the living world of pro‐ and eukaryotes and viruses, which delivered “a piece of bad news wrapped in protein” as defined by Peter Medawar, Nobel Prize Laureate, in 1960. However, MS is constantly evolving, and novel approaches allow for a better understanding of interactions in this micro‐ and nanoworld. Currently, we can investigate the interplay between the virus and the cell by analyzing proteomes, interactomes, virus‐cell interactions, and search for the compounds that build viral structures. In addition, by using MS, it is possible to look at the cell from the broader perspective and determine the role of viral infection on the scale of the organism, for example, monitoring the crosstalk between infected tissues and the immune system. In such a way, MS became one of the major tools for the modern virology, allowing us to see the infection in the context of the whole cell or the organism. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Infiltration of kidneys with these cells is a hallmark of lupus nephritis and is associated with more severe disease and with increased risk of progression to end‐stage renal disease. This review presents current knowledge of the diversity of these cells and their involvement in kidney inflammation and resolution and describes how they contribute to the chronic inflammation of lupus nephritis. A better understanding of the subset heterogeneity and diverse functions of mononuclear phagocytes in the lupus nephritis kidney should provide fertile ground for the development of new therapeutic approaches that promote the differentiation and survival of protective subsets while targeting pathogenic cell subsets that cause inflammation and fibrosis.","Davidson, Anne",ACR Open Rheumatol,617,1

METHODS The medical records of 4 patients with dural CCFs treated via the thrombosed SOV were reviewed. All procedures were performed unilaterally in the interventional radiology unit with the administration of general anesthesia. The SOV was exposed via an eyelid crease incision, and then an angiocatheter was inserted in the vein and advanced through the segment with thrombosis to the cavernous sinus, where embolizing agents were deposited. After the procedure, the patients were followed up and evaluated clinically. RESULTS Three patients had unilateral CCFs, and 1 had a bilateral CCF (3 women and 1 man; age range, 58-68 years). The CCFs were Barrow type B (n=2) and Barrow type D (n=2). All patients had severe venous congestive orbital symptoms, chorioretinopathy, increased intraocular pressure, and visual loss. In all cases, the SOV appeared as a pale, thin, tortuous vessel adherent to the surrounding tissues during the surgical procedure. In 3 patients, the cavernous sinus was successfully embolized, and all symptoms were completely resolved without recurrence during follow up (3, 15, and 24 months). In the patient in whom the SOV could not be catheterized, the symptoms regressed slowly, but visual acuity remained unchanged during follow up (64 months). CONCLUSIONS Dural CCFs can be successfully treated through the SOV, even when the vein is thrombosed. Identification and catheterization of the thrombosed SOV may be difficult because of the tiny and fibrotic structure of the vein.","Güven Yilmaz, Suzan; Yazici, Bülent; Çetinkaya, Altuğ; Yağci, Ayşe",Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery,617,11

The working group that contributed to the drafting of this paper agrees that it is appropriate that healthcare personnel, who is particularly committed to taking care of those who are currently in need of intensive or sub-intensive care, should benefit from clear operational indications that are useful to orient care and, at the same time, that the population should know in advance which criteria will guide the tragic choices that may fall on each one of us.

While SARS-CoV-2-triggered hyperinflammatory tissue-damaging and immunothrombotic responses are thought to be major causes of respiratory failure and death, how they relate to lung immunopathological changes remains unclear. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) can contribute to inflammation-associated lung damage, thrombosis, and fibrosis. However, whether NETs infiltrate particular compartments in severe COVID-19 lungs remains to be clarified. Here we analyzed postmortem lung specimens from four patients who succumbed to COVID-19 and four patients who died from a COVID-19-unrelated cause. We report the presence of NETs in the lungs of each COVID-19 patient. NETs were found in the airway compartment and neutrophil-rich inflammatory areas of the interstitium, while NET-prone primed neutrophils were present in arteriolar microthrombi. Our results support the hypothesis that NETs may represent drivers of severe pulmonary complications of COVID-19 and suggest that NET-targeting approaches could be considered for the treatment of uncontrolled tissue-damaging and thrombotic responses in COVID-19.","Radermecker, Coraline; Detrembleur, Nancy; Guiot, Julien; Cavalier, Etienne; Henket, Monique; d039,; Emal, Céline; Vanwinge, Céline; Cataldo, Didier; Oury, Cécile; Delvenne, Philippe; Marichal, Thomas",J. exp. med,617,16

The first suspected case in the Philippines was investigated on January 22, 2020, and 633 suspected cases were reported as of March 1. We describe the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the first two confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines, both admitted to the national infectious disease referral hospital in Manila. Case presentation: Both patients were previously healthy Chinese nationals on vacation in the Philippines travelling as a couple during January 2020. Patient 1, a 39-year-old female, had symptoms of cough and sore throat and was admitted to San Lazaro Hospital in Manila on January 25. Physical examination was unremarkable. Influenza B, human coronavirus 229E, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NPS/OPS) swabs. On January 30, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs and she was identified as the first confirmed COVID-19 case in the Philippines. Her symptoms resolved, and she was discharged. Patient 2, a 44-year-old male, had symptoms of fever, cough, and chills. Influenza B and Streptococcus pneumoniae were detected by PCR on initial NPS/OPS swabs. He was treated for community-acquired pneumonia with intravenous antibiotics, but his condition deteriorated and he required intubation. On January 31, SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was reported to be detected by PCR on the initial swabs, and he was identified as the 2nd confirmed COVID-19 infection in the Philippines. On February 1, the patient's condition deteriorated, and following a cardiac arrest, it was not possible to revive him. He was thus confirmed as the first COVID-19 death outside of China. Conclusions: This case report highlights several important clinical and public health issues. Despite both patients being young adults with no significant past medical history, they had very different clinical courses, illustrating how COVID-19 can present with a wide spectrum of disease. As of March 1, there have been three confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines. Continued vigilance is required to identify new cases.","Edrada, Edna M.; Lopez, Edmundo B.; Villarama, Jose Benito; Salva Villarama, Eumelia P.; Dagoc, Bren F.; Smith, Chris; Sayo, Ana Ria; Verona, Jeffrey A.; Trifalgar-Arches, Jamie; Lazaro, Jezreel; Balinas, Ellen Grace M.; Telan, Elizabeth Freda O.; Roy, Lynsil; Galon, Myvie; Florida, Carl Hill N.; Ukawa, Tatsuya; Villaneuva, Annavi Marie G.; Saito, Nobuo; Nepomuceno, Jean Raphael; Ariyoshi, Koya; Carlos, Celia; Nicolasora, Amalea Dulcene; Solante, Rontgene M.",Trop.

However, sensitive information can be derived from movement patterns, thus protecting the privacy of mobile users is a major concern. Users may only be willing to disclose their locations when some condition is met, for instance in proximity of a disaster area or an event of interest. Currently, such functionality can be achieved using searchable encryption. Such cryptographic primitives provide provable guarantees for privacy, and allow decryption only when the location satisfies some predicate. Nevertheless, they rely on expensive pairing-based cryptography (PBC), of which direct application to the domain of location updates leads to impractical solutions. We propose secure and efficient techniques for private processing of location updates that complement the use of PBC and lead to significant gains in performance by reducing the amount of required pairing operations. We implement two optimizations that further improve performance: materialization of results to expensive mathematical operations, and parallelization. We also propose an heuristic that brings down the computational overhead through enlarging an alert zone by a small factor (given as system parameter), therefore trading off a small and controlled amount of privacy for significant performance gains. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed techniques significantly improve performance compared to the baseline, and reduce the searchable encryption overhead to a level that is practical in a computing environment with reasonable resources, such as the cloud.","Ghinita, Gabriel; Nguyen, Kien; Maruseac, Mihai; Shahabi, Cyrus",,617,16

This relationship is also important for understanding the persistence of viruses in droplets generated from wastewater, freshwater, and seawater. We investigated the effects of salt (0, 1, and 35 g/L), protein (0, 100, and 1000 μg/mL), surfactant (0, 1, and 10 μg/mL), and droplet pH (4.0, 7.0, and 10.0) on the viability of viruses in 1-μL droplets pipetted onto polystyrene surfaces and exposed to 20%, 50%, and 80% relative humidity (RH) using a culture-based approach. Results showed that viability of MS2, a non-enveloped virus, was generally higher than that of Φ6, an enveloped virus, in droplets after 1 hour. The chemical composition of droplets greatly influenced virus viability. Specifically, the survival of MS2 was similar in droplets at different pH values, but the viability of Φ6 was significantly reduced in acidic and basic droplets compared to neutral ones. The presence of bovine serum albumin protected both MS2 and Φ6 from inactivation in droplets. The effects of sodium chloride and the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate varied by virus type and RH. Meanwhile, RH affected the viability of viruses as shown previously: viability was lowest at intermediate to high RH. The results demonstrate that the viability of viruses is determined by the chemical composition of carrier droplets, especially pH and protein content, and environmental factors. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding the chemical composition of carrier droplets in order to predict the persistence of viruses contained in them.","Lin, Kaisen; Schulte, Chase R.; Marr, Linsey C.",PLoS One,617,20

Membrane fractions prepared from a stably transfected hCD13-positive murine NIH/3T3 cell line were used to immunize BALB/c mice, with the intention that hCD13 would be the major immunogenic molecule recognized by the immune system. Spleen RNA from the immunized mice served to generate a combinatorial scFv phage display library. The library was adsorbed against non-transfected NIH/3T3 or Sf21 insect cells to eliminate nonrelevant binders. The supernatant was then used for panning with either hCD13-transfected Sf21 insect cells or a hCD13-expressing human leukemia-derived cell line. Therefore, the key concepts of the procedure were the presentation of hCD13 as the sole human antigen on murine NIH/3T3 cells and a screening strategy where hCD13 was the major common antigen of the material used for immunization and panning. Two different hCD13-reactive phages were isolated and the soluble scFvs were expressed in E. coli and purified. The two scFvs, anti-hCD13-1 and anti-hCD13-3, differed at four amino acid positions in their VH regions and both had high affinities for hCD13 as determined by surface plasmon resonance (K D=7 and 33×10−10 M, respectively). Both efficiently recognized hCD13 on intact cells. Therefore, the procedure allowed the production of high affinity scFvs reacting with a desired antigen in its native conformation without requiring extensive purification of the antigen and should be useful for the preparation of scFvs against other conformation-sensitive cell-surface antigens.","Peipp, Matthias; Simon, Nicola; Loichinger, Alexandra; Baum, Wolfgang; Mahr, Kerstin; Zunino, Susan J.; Fey, Georg H.",Journal of Immunological Methods,617,1
